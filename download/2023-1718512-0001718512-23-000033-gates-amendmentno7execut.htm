If the Borrower fails to specify an Approved Currency of a Loan in a Committed Loan Notice, such Loan shall be made in Dollars.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be made as or converted to (x) in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, Base Rate Loans or (y) in the case of any Loan denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or  SONIA RateRFR Loans in the Approved Currency having an Interest Period of one month, as applicable. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or one-month Eurocurrency RateRFR Loans shall be - 85- effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SONIA RateRFR Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, SONIA RateRFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.  No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in another Approved Currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original Approved Currency or reborrowed in another Approved Currency. Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly(b) notify each Lender of the amount (and Approved Currency) of its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion or continuation described in Section 2.02(a).  In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office not later than (i) 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency RateRFR Loans denominated in Dollars or Term SOFR Loans, (ii) 8:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency RateRFR Loans denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency and (iii) 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice for any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  The Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent by wire transfer of such funds in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loan or SONIA (c) RateRFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loan or SONIA RateRFR Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.05 in connection therewith.  During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require that no Loans in any Approved Currency may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans or SONIA RateRFR Loans, as applicable, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency  RateTerm SOFR Loans or SONIA RateRFR Loans, as applicable, denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the(d) interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans or SONIA  RateRFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.  The determination of the Eurocurrency Rate or  SONIA RateTerm SOFR or any RFR by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the announcement of such change. After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all(e) conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than fifteen (15) Interest Periods in effect. The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing(f) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such - 86- </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of(b) Credit. (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Issuance Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or his/her delegate or designee.  Such Letter of Credit Issuance Request must be received by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least two Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be; or, in each case, such other date and time as the relevant L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion.  In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Issuance Request shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer:  (a) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (b) the amount thereof; (c) the relevant Approved Currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated; (d) the expiry date thereof; (e) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (f) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (g) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (h) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request.  In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Issuance Request shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request. (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Issuance Request, the relevant L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Issuance Request from the Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.  Upon receipt by the relevant L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the relevant L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Issuance Request, the relevant L/C Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an &#8220;Auto-Extension Letter of Credit&#8221;); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a number of days (the &#8220;Non-Extension Notice Date&#8221;) prior to the last day of such twelve month period to be agreed upon by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Borrower at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the applicable Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided that the relevant L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the relevant L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may - 89- be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied. (iv) Promptly after issuance of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.(c) (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in such Approved Currency, unless the L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars.  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.  Not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time), in the case of a drawing in Dollars, or 2:00 p.m. (London time) (or, if earlier, 9:00 a.m. New York city time), in the case of a drawing in an Approved Foreign Currency, on (1) the next Business Day immediately following the date of any honoring of a drawing by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit that the Borrower receives notice thereof (each such date, an &#8220;Honor Date&#8221;), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in the relevant Approved Currency; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a Revolving Credit Borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility or a Swing Line Borrowing under the Swing Line Facility in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower&#8217;s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as applicable.  In the event that (x) a drawing denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.03(c)(i) and (y) the Dollar amount paid by the Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the applicable Approved Foreign Currency equal to the drawing, the Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Approved Currency in the full amount of the drawing.  If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof) (the &#8220;Unreimbursed Amount&#8221;), and the amount of such Appropriate Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof.  In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans,  Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans or SONIA RateRFR Loans, as applicable, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Appropriate Lenders and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice).  Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (ii) Each Appropriate Lender (including any Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the - 90- </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit the funds so received to the relevant L/C Issuer in Dollars. (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, SONIA RateTerm SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency  RateRFR Loans, as applicable, because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest (which begins to accrue upon funding by the L/C Issuer) at the Default Rate for Revolving Credit Loans.  In such event, each Appropriate Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. (iv) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer. (v) Each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  A certificate of the relevant L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. - 91- Repayment of Participations.(d) (i) If, at any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement hereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.

The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower&#8217;s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuers, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of Section 2.03(e); provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit, in each case as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. - 93- Cash Collateral.  If (i) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit(g) may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn (and without limiting the requirements of Section 2.03(a)(ii)(C)), (ii) any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Lenders holding a majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02 or (iii) an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do so not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), (1) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice and (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (iii), the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day.

For purposes hereof, &#8220;Cash Collateralize&#8221; means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L/C Issuer and the Appropriate Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (&#8220;Cash Collateral&#8221;) pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Appropriate Lenders).

The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuers and the Revolving Credit Lenders of the applicable Facility, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a Cash Collateral Account and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents as directed by the Borrower.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are expressly subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer.  To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L/C Obligations and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.  To the extent any Event of Default giving rise to the requirement to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.03(g) is cured or otherwise waived by the Required Lenders, then so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Cash Collateral pledged to Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit shall be refunded to the Borrower. Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the(h) account of the Revolving Credit Lenders for the applicable Revolving Credit Facility (in accordance with their Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement) a Letter of Credit fee in Dollars for each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate for Revolving Credit Loans times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum amount increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of - 94- </FONT></DIV>

Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum - 97- and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving(ii) Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.

All prepayments under this Section 2.05 shall be made together with, in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate LoanRFR Loan or Term SOFR  Loan (solely limited to the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor, any amounts owing in respect of such Eurocurrency Rate LoanRFR Loan or Term SOFR  Loan (solely limited to the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) pursuant to Section 3.05.  Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of Section 2.05(b), so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate LoansRFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans (solely  limited to the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) is required to be made under this Section 2.05(b), prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, deposit the amount of any such prepayment otherwise required to be made thereunder into a Cash Collateral Account until the last day of such Interest Period, at which time the Administrative Agent shall be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of such Loans in accordance with this Section 2.05(b). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall also be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of the outstanding Loans in accordance with this Section 2.05(b). (ix) Term Opt-out of Prepayment.  With respect to each prepayment of Term Loans required pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(i) or (ii), (A) each Lender of Term Loans will have the right to refuse such offer of prepayment by giving written notice of such refusal to the Administrative Agent -109- within one (1) Business Day after such Lender&#8217;s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of such offer of prepayment (&#8220;Declined Proceeds&#8221;) (in which case the Borrower shall not prepay any Term Loans of such Lender on the date that is specified in clause (B) below) , (B) the Borrower will make all such prepayments not so refused upon the fourth Business Day after delivery of notice by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(vii) and (C) any Declined Proceeds may be retained by the Borrower. (x) In connection with any mandatory prepayments by the Borrower of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), such prepayments shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the then outstanding Term Loans of the applicable Class or Classes being prepaid irrespective of whether such outstanding Term Loans are Base Rate Loans, Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency RateRFR Loans; provided that if no Lenders exercise the right to waive a given mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(ix), then, with respect to such mandatory prepayment, the amount of such mandatory prepayment within any tranche of Term Loans shall be applied first to Term Loans of such tranche that are Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before application to Term Loans of such tranche that are Eurocurrency RateRFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans in a manner that minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.05. (xi) Foreign Dispositions and Excess Cash Flow.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.05, (i) the proceeds of the Initial B-2 Euro Term Loans made on the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date shall be used to prepay the entire amount of the Initial B-1 Euro Term Loans, (ii) the proceeds of the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans made on the Amendment No. 4 Effective Date shall be used to prepay the entire amount of the Initial B-2 Dollar Term Loans and (iii) the proceeds of the Initial B-4 Dollar Term Loans made on the -110- </FONT></DIV>

The Borrower shall pay to the Agents such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever (except as expressly agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Agent).

Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Evidence of Indebtedness.SECTION 2.11 The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts(a) or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrower, in each case in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender&#8217;s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to(c) Sections 2.11(a) and (b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Payments Generally.SECTION 2.12 All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction(a) for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to an Approved Foreign Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office for Dollar-denominated payments and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder in an Approved Foreign Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in such Approved Foreign Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. (London time) (or, if earlier, 9:00 a.m. New York City time) on the dates specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s applicable Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after the time specified above shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Except as otherwise provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall(b) come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate  Loans, SONIA RateRFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the(c) date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then: if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on(i) demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each -116- </FONT></DIV>

When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing.  If such Lender does not pay such amount (including, without limitation, failure to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan) forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be(d) made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV or in the applicable Incremental Amendment, Extension Amendment or Refinancing Amendment are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in(e) Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan(f) in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or(g) any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by -117- the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.04.  If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law), but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the sum of (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (b) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. Sharing of Payments.SECTION 2.13 If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender&#8217;s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender&#8217;s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon.  For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.  Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. Incremental Credit Extensions.SECTION 2.14 Incremental Commitments.  The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the(a) Closing Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent (an &#8220;Incremental Loan Request&#8221;), request (A) one or more new commitments which may be in the same Facility (each, an &#8220;Incremental Term Facility&#8221;) as any outstanding Term Loans of an existing Class of Term Loans (a &#8220;Term Loan Increase&#8221;) or a new Class of term loans (collectively with any Term Loan Increase, the &#8220;Incremental Term Commitments&#8221;) -118- </FONT></DIV>

Incremental Loans.  Any Incremental Commitments effected through the establishment(b) of one or more new revolving credit commitments or new Term Loans made on an Incremental Facility Closing Date shall be designated a separate Class of Incremental Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement, except in the case of a Term Loan Increase or a Revolving Commitment Increase.  On any Incremental Facility Closing Date on which any Incremental Term Commitments of any Class are effected (including through any Term Loan Increase), subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions in this Section 2.14, (i) each Incremental Term Lender of such Class shall make a Loan to the Borrower (an &#8220;Incremental Term Loan&#8221;) in an amount equal to its Incremental Term Commitment of such Class and (ii) each Incremental Term Lender of such Class shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Term Commitment of such Class and the Incremental Term Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto.

Each Incremental Loan Request from the Borrower pursuant(c) to this Section 2.14 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments.  Incremental Term Loans may be made, and Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments may be provided, by any existing Lender (but each existing Lender will not have an obligation to make any Incremental Commitment, nor will the Borrower have any obligation to approach any existing lenders to provide any Incremental Commitment) or by any other bank or other financial institution (any such other bank or other financial institution being called an &#8220;Additional Lender&#8221;) (each such existing Lender or Additional Lender providing such, an &#8220;Incremental Revolving Credit Lender&#8221; or &#8220;Incremental Term Lender,&#8221; as applicable, and, collectively, the &#8220;Incremental Lenders&#8221;); provided that (i) the Administrative Agent, each Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer shall have consented (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such Lender&#8217;s or Additional Lender&#8217;s making such Incremental Term Loans or providing such Revolving Commitment Increases to the extent such consent, if any, would be required under Section 10.07(b) for an assignment of Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, to such Lender or Additional Lender, (ii) with respect to Incremental Term Commitments, any Affiliated Lender providing an Incremental Term Commitment shall be subject to the same restrictions set forth in Section 10.07(l) as they would otherwise be subject to with respect to any purchase by or assignment to such Affiliated Lender of Term Loans and (iii) Affiliated Lenders may not provide Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments. -119- Effectiveness of Incremental Amendment.

The Borrower may elect to use the Incurrence-Based Incremental Amount prior to the Free and Clear Incremental Amount or any combination thereof, and any portion of any Incremental Facility incurred in reliance on the Free and Clear Incremental Amount shall be reclassified, as the Borrower may elect from time to time, as incurred under the Incurrence-Based Incremental Amount if the Borrower meets the applicable ratio for the Incurrence-Based Incremental Amount at such time on a Pro Forma Basis, and if any applicable ratio for the Incurrence-Based Incremental Amount would be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis as of the end of any subsequent fiscal quarter after the initial incurrence of such Incremental Facility, such reclassification shall be deemed to have automatically occurred whether or not elected by the Borrower.

For the avoidance of doubt, invalidity of Term SOFR determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof without giving effect to clause (a)(ii) thereof shall not affect the ability of the Borrower to incur Daily SOFR Loans pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition thereof. Inability to Determine Rates.SECTION 3.03 If the Required Lenders determine that (i) for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the applicable Eurocurrency Rate, EURIBO Rate, TIBOR Rate, SONIA Rate or Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period, as applicable with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency  Rate Loan, SONIA RateRFR Loan or Term SOFR Loan in a given Approved Currency, or (ii) that the Eurocurrency Rate, EURIBO Rate, TIBOR Rate or, SONIA Rate or Term SOFR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SONIA RateTerm SOFR Loan  (solely limited to the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) or RFR Loan in such Approved Currency, as  applicable, does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or that -133- deposits in the applicable Approved Currency in which such proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or  SONIA Rate LoanRFR Loan or Term SOFR Loan (solely limited to the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) is to be denominated are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for the applicable amount and the Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan or SONIA Rate LoanRFR  Loan or Term SOFR Loan (solely limited to the Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans), in each case, in the applicable Approved Currency, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans, TIBOR  Rate, SONIA RateRFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, in the affected Approved Currency shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, TIBOR Rate or SONIA RateRFR Loans or a Borrowing of or conversion to Term SOFR Loans, in each case, denominated in the affected Approved Currency, and with respect to Term SOFR Loans make any such request into a request for a Borrowing of Daily SOFR Loans, or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request, if applicable, into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein. Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on SECTION 3.04 Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If any Lender reasonably determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change(a) in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the Closing Date, or such Lender&#8217;s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurocurrency RateRFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, or any Taxes excluded from the definition of Indemnified Taxes under exceptions (i) through (v) thereof or (ii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c)) and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining Eurocurrency RateRFR Loan or Term SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligations to make any Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, then from time to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for all purposes under this Agreement, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued; provided that to the extent any increased costs or reductions are incurred by any Lender as a result of any requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or pursuant to Basel III after the Closing Date, then such Lender shall be compensated pursuant to this Section 3.04 only if such Lender imposes such charges under other syndicated credit facilities involving similarly situated borrowers that such Lender is a lender under. If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or(b) any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender&#8217;s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender&#8217;s -134- </FONT></DIV>

Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this(d) Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s right to demand such compensation. If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.04, then such Lender will, if(e) requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 3.04(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Sections 3.04(a), (b), (c) or (d). Funding Losses.SECTION 3.05 Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by it as a result of: (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate  LoanRFR Loan or Term SOFR Loan (solely limited to Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) of the Borrower on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurocurrency Rate LoanRFR Loan or  Term SOFR Loan (solely limited to Initial B-3 Dollar Term Loans) of the Borrower on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower, including any loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to -135- maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained; or (c) any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or Participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit(b) issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each such L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Agents in this Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term &#8220;Agent&#8221; as used in this Article IX and in the definition of &#8220;Agent-Related Person&#8221; included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer. Each of the Secured Parties (by acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral Documents)(c) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the agent of (and to hold any security interest created by the Collateral Documents for and on behalf of or on trust for) such Secured Party for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Collateral Agent (and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Collateral Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX (including Section 9.07, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. Each Lender and each other Secured Party (by acceptance of the benefits of the(d) Collateral Documents) hereby (i) acknowledges that it has received a copy of the Intercreditor Agreements, (ii) agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements to the extent then in effect, and (iii) authorizes and instructs the Collateral Agent to enter into each Intercreditor Agreement as Collateral Agent and on behalf of such Lender or Secured Party. -188- </FONT></DIV>

Notice of Default.SECTION 9.05 The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a &#8220;notice of default.&#8221;  The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.  The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders (or, if a Financial Covenant Event of Default occurs and is continuing and prior to the expiration of the Term Loan Standstill Period, the Required Revolving Credit Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility only, and in such case only with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments, Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans, L/C Obligations, Letters of Credit and L/C Credit Extensions)  in accordance with Article VIII; provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

Withholding Tax Indemnity.SECTION 9.13 To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall, within 10 days after written demand therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.04 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

Appointment of Supplemental Agents.SECTION 9.14 It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no(a) violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction.  It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such -195- additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a &#8220;Supplemental Agent&#8221; and collectively as &#8220;Supplemental Agents&#8221;). In the event that the Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental Agent with respect to any(b) Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Article IX and of Sections 10.04 and 10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Collateral Agent and/or such Supplemental Agent, as the context may require. Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required by any Supplemental(c) Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, such Loan Party shall execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.  In case any Supplemental Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Agent. ARTICLE X Miscellaneous Amendments, Etc.SECTION 10.01 Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders, or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders, and such Loan Party and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided that any amendment or waiver contemplated in clauses (g) or (i) below, shall only require the consent of such Loan Party and the Required Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Facility Lenders under the applicable Facility, as applicable; provided, further, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall: (a) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of each Lender holding such Commitment (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent or of any Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender); (b) postpone any date scheduled for, or reduce or forgive the amount of, any payment of principal or interest under Sections 2.07 or 2.08 without the written consent of each Lender holding the applicable Obligation (it being understood that the waiver of (or amendment to the terms of) any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans shall not constitute a postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of principal or interest and it being understood that any change to the definition of &#8220;Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio,&#8221; -196- </FONT></DIV>

This paragraph (b) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis among such Facilities. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit  and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to(c) Sections 10.07(d) and (e), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, (1) other than in connection with an assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(m), the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and (2) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).  Upon request, and the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this clause (c) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.07(f). The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower,(d) shall maintain at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption, each Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption delivered to it, and each notice of cancellation of any Loans delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.07(m) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of the Loans, L/C Obligations (specifying the Unreimbursed Amounts), L/C Borrowings and the amounts due under Section 2.03, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#8220;Register&#8221;).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each -205- Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent and, with respect to such Lender&#8217;s own interest only, any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  This Section 10.07(d) and Section 2.11 shall be construed so that all Loans are at all times maintained in &#8220;registered form&#8221; within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related Treasury regulations (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is an Affiliated Lender nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to monitor the aggregate amount of Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall (i) promptly (and in any case, not less than five (5) Business Days (or shorter period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) prior to the proposed effective date of any amendment, consent or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01) provide to the Administrative Agent, a complete list of all Affiliated Lenders holding Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans at such time and (ii) not less than five (5) Business Days (or shorter period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) prior to the proposed effective date of any amendment, consent or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01, provide to the Administrative Agent, a complete list of all Debt Fund Affiliates holding Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans at such time. Upon its receipt of, and consent to, a duly completed Assignment and Assumption(e) executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, an Administrative Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) above, if applicable, and the written consent of the Administrative Agent, if required, and, if required, the Borrower, the Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer to such assignment and any applicable tax forms required pursuant to Section 3.01(d), the Administrative Agent shall promptly (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (e). Any Lender may at any time sell participations to any Person, subject to the proviso to(f) Section 10.07(a) (each, a &#8220;Participant&#8221;), in all or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender&#8217;s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the second proviso to Section 10.01 that requires the affirmative vote of such Lender. Subject to Section 10.07(g), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(c).  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant&#8217;s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the -206- </FONT></DIV>

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01,(g) 3.04 or 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at(h) any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a &#8220;Granting(i) Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an &#8220;SPC&#8221;) the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) such SPC and the applicable Loan or any applicable part thereof, shall be appropriately reflected in the Participant Register.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such Section), but neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement except in the case of Sections 3.01 or 3.04, to the extent that the grant to the SPC was made with the prior written consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall have reasonable basis for withholding consent if an exercise by SPC immediately after the grant would result in materially increased indemnification obligations to the Borrower at such time), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any Rating Agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. -207- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, without the consent of the(j) Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (1) any Lender may in accordance with applicable Law create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it and (2) any Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any L/C Issuer or Swing Line(k) Lender may, upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, respectively; provided that on or prior to the expiration of such 30-day period with respect to such resignation, the relevant L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender shall have identified a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender reasonably acceptable to the Borrower willing to accept its appointment as successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, and to assume a Letter of Credit Percentage equal to or greater than the Letter of Credit Percentage of the resigning L/C Issuer.  In the event of any such resignation of an L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders willing to accept such appointment a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the relevant L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, except as expressly provided above.

If the Swing Line Lender resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Loans, SONIA RateRFR Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).

Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

Acknowledgement Regarding any Supported QFCs.  To the extent that theSECTION 10.24 Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221;, and each such QFC, a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;)(a) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer -217- would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. As used in this Section 10.24, the following terms have the following meanings:(b) &#8220;BHC Act Affiliate&#8221; of a party means an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party. &#8220;Covered Entity&#8221; means any of the following:  (i) a &#8220;covered entity&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 252.82(b); (ii) a &#8220;covered bank&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 47.3(b); or (iii) a &#8220;covered FSI&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 382.2(b). &#8220;Default Right&#8221; has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable. &#8220;QFC&#8221; has the meaning assigned to the term &#8220;qualified financial contract&#8221; in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).

This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding. -222- </FONT></DIV>
