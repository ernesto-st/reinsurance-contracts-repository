Second Priority Term Loans shall be paid in full no later than the Maturity

Second Priority Term Loan Commitment.

         prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent a fully executed Funding Notice, which Funding
         Notice shall be in the form of Exhibit E. Promptly upon receipt by the
         Administrative Agent of such Funding Notice, the Administrative Agent
         shall notify each Lender of the proposed borrowing.

                  (ii)     Each Lender shall make each Second Priority Term Loan
         to be made by it hereunder available to the Administrative Agent not
         later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the Closing Date, by wire
         transfer of same day funds in Dollars, at the Principal Office. Upon
         satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified in Article
         III and subject to Section 2.02(b) (Pro Rata Shares; Availability of
         Funds) below, the Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of the

         available to the Borrower on the Closing Date by causing an amount of
         same day funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Second
         Priority Term Loans received by the Administrative Agent from the
         Lenders to be credited to one or more accounts as may be designated in
         writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.02. Amount of Second Priority Term Loans; Availability of Funds.

         (a)      Amount of Second Priority Term Loans. All Second Priority Term
Loans shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously in the amount of their
respective Second Priority Term Loan Commitments, it being understood that no
Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other
Lender's obligation to make a Second Priority Term Loan hereunder nor shall any
Second Priority Term Loan Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as
a result of a default by any other Lender in such other Lender's obligation to
make a Second Priority Term Loan hereunder.

         (b)      Availability of Funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by any Lender prior to the Closing Date that such Lender does
not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such
Lender's Second Priority Term Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that
such Lender has made and will make such amount available to the Administrative
Agent on the Closing Date and the Administrative Agent may, in its sole
discretion, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount on the Closing Date. If such corresponding amount is not in
fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on
demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the
Closing Date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at
the customary rate set by the Administrative Agent for the correction of errors
among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such
Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative
Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from the
Closing Date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at
the rate payable hereunder for Second Priority Term Loans. Nothing in this
Section 2.02(b) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
fulfill its Second Priority Term Loan Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any
rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default
by such Lender hereunder.

shall be applied (together with the net proceeds from the making of the First
Priority Term Loans and the issuance of the Notes) by the Borrower to prepay and
retire the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility and to pay certain fees and
expenses due under this Agreement and the other Financing Documents in
connection therewith. No portion of the proceeds of any Second Priority Term
Loans shall be used in any manner that causes or might cause the funding of the
Second Priority Term Loans or the application of such proceeds to violate
Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X or any other regulation of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act.

Second Priority Term Loan; and provided further, that in the event of any

Principal Office a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders and the Second Priority Term Loans made by each Lender from time to
time (the "Register"). The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. The Administrative Agent shall record in the Register
the Second Priority Term Loans, and each repayment or prepayment in respect of
the principal amount of the Second Priority Term Loans, and any such recordation
shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and each Lender, absent manifest
error; provided, that the failure to make any such recordation, or any error in
such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower's Obligations in respect of any
Second Priority Term Loan. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative
Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent solely for purposes of maintaining the
Register as provided in this Section 2.04, and the Borrower hereby agrees that,
to the extent the Administrative Agent serves in such capacity, the
Administrative Agent and its officers, directors, employees, agents and
affiliates shall constitute "Indemnitees" under Section 12.03 (Indemnity).

         (c)      Second Priority Term Loan Notes. If so requested by any Lender
by written notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at
any time, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if
applicable and if so specified in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee
of such Lender pursuant to Section 12.06 (Successors and Assigns;
Participations)) on the Closing Date (or, if such notice is delivered after the
Closing Date, promptly after the Borrower's receipt of such notice), a Second
Priority Term Loan Note to evidence such Lender's Second Priority Term Loan.

SECTION 2.05. Interest.

         (a)      Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Second Priority Term
Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date
made through repayment (whether by acceleration or otherwise) thereof as
follows:

                  (i)      if a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate plus 4.75% per
                  annum; or

                  (ii)     if a LIBOR Rate Loan, at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus
                  5.75% per annum.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, during the period
from the Closing Date through March 31, 2004, the Second Priority Term Loans
shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof at 7.00% per annum.

                                       50
<PAGE>

         (b)      The Type of Loan, and the Interest Period with respect to any
LIBOR Rate Loan, shall be selected by the Borrower and notified to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to the applicable Continuation
Notice. If on any day a Second Priority Term Loan is outstanding with respect to
which a Funding Notice or Continuation Notice has not been delivered to the
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof specifying the
applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day such
Second Priority Term Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, during the period from the Closing Date through March 31, 2004, the
Second Priority Term Loans shall be deemed to be LIBOR Rate Loans and shall have
the "Interest Period" contemplated by clause (d) of the definition thereof.

         (c)      In connection with LIBOR Rate Loans there shall be no more
than five Interest Periods outstanding at any time. In the event that the
Borrower fails to specify the Type of Loan in the applicable Funding Notice or
Continuation Notice, such Second Priority Term Loan (if outstanding as a LIBOR
Rate Loan) will be automatically converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day
of the then-current Interest Period for such Second Priority Term Loan (or if
outstanding as a Base Rate Loan will remain as, or (if not then outstanding)
will be made as, a Base Rate Loan). In the event that the Borrower fails to
specify an Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loan in the applicable Funding
Notice or Continuation Notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one month. As soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on each Interest Rate Determination Date, the Administrative Agent
shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to
the LIBOR Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the
applicable Interest Period and, upon the request of the Borrower, shall promptly
give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the
Borrower and each Lender.

         (d)      Interest payable pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be computed
(i) in the case of Base Rate Loans on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as
the case may be, and (ii) in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, on the basis of a
360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period
during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Second Priority Term Loan,
the date of the making of such Second Priority Term Loan or the first day of an
Interest Period applicable to such Second Priority Term Loan or, with respect to
a Base Rate Loan being converted from a LIBOR Rate Loan, the date of conversion
of such LIBOR Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be
included, and the date of payment of such Second Priority Term Loan or the
expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Second Priority Term
Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan,
the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such LIBOR Rate Loan, as the
case may be, shall be excluded; provided, if a Second Priority Term Loan is
repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on
that Second Priority Term Loan.

         (e)      Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Second
Priority Term Loan shall be payable in arrears on and to each Interest Payment
Date applicable to that Second Priority Term Loan.

SECTION 2.06. Continuation Notice.

                                       51
<PAGE>

         (a)      Subject to Section 2.15 (Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy)
and so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and then be
continuing, the Borrower shall have the option:

                  (i)      to convert at any time all or any part of any Second
         Priority Term Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
         $1,000,000 in excess of that amount from one Type of Loan to another
         Type of Loan; provided, a LIBOR Rate Loan may only be converted on the
         expiration of the Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan
         unless the Borrower shall pay all amounts due under Section 2.14
         (Making or Maintaining Second Priority Term Loans) in connection with
         any such conversion; or

                  (ii)     upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable
         to any LIBOR Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Second
         Priority Term Loan equal to $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
         $1,000,000 in excess of that amount as a LIBOR Rate Loan.

         (b)      The Borrower shall deliver a Continuation Notice to the
Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least one
Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a
conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of
the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a
continuation of, a LIBOR Rate Loan). Except as otherwise provided herein, a
Continuation Notice for conversion to, or continuation of, any LIBOR Rate Loans
shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date,
and the Borrower shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in
accordance therewith. In the event that the Borrower shall have failed to
provide a Continuation Notice as required by this Section 2.06(b) to continue
any LIBOR Rate Loan into a subsequent Interest Period (and shall not otherwise
have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.06(b) to convert such LIBOR
Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan), then such LIBOR Rate Loan shall, at the end of
the applicable Interest Period, automatically be converted into a Base Rate
Loan.

         (c)      Any Continuation Notice shall be executed by an Officer of the
Borrower in a writing delivered to the Administrative Agent. In lieu of
delivering a written notice, the Borrower may give the Administrative Agent
telephonic notice by the required time of any continuation; provided each such
notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of the applicable
Continuation Notice to the Administrative Agent on or before the applicable date
of continuation. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any
liability to the Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above
that the Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a
duly authorized officer or other Person authorized on behalf of the Borrower or
otherwise acting in good faith

SECTION 2.07. Default Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the
outstanding principal amount of all Second Priority Term Loans and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any accrued but unpaid
interest payments thereon and any accrued but unpaid fees and other amounts
hereunder, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in
any proceeding under applicable Bankruptcy Laws) payable upon demand at a rate
that is (a) 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate then otherwise payable
under this Agreement with respect to

                                       52
<PAGE>

the applicable Second Priority Term Loans or (b) in the case of any such fees
and other amounts, at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate
then otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans (the "Default
Rate"); provided that if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on
the expiration date of the Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loans, then such
LIBOR Rate Loans shall thereupon become Base Rate Loans and shall thereafter
bear interest payable upon demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of
the interest rate then otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate
Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in
this Section 2.07 is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not
constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any
rights or remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
Lender.

SECTION 2.08. Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to each Agent such fees in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon by the Borrower and such Agent
in writing.

SECTION 2.09. Payments. The principal amounts of the Second Priority Term Loans
(reduced in connection with any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the Second
Priority Term Loans, in accordance with Sections 2.10 (Voluntary Prepayments)
and 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment Offers), as applicable) shall be repaid by the
Borrower in accordance with the repayment schedule set forth on Schedule 2.09,
with any remaining unpaid principal, interest, fees and costs due and payable in
full on the Maturity Date.

SECTION 2.10. Voluntary Prepayments.

         (a)      Voluntary Prepayments.

                  (i)      The Borrower may not voluntarily prepay Second
         Priority Term Loans except as provided in clause (b) below. In the
         event of any voluntary prepayment in accordance with clause (b), the
         Borrower may prepay any such Second Priority Term Loans on any Business
         Day in whole or in part, in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000
         and integral multiples of $1,000,000 (or the remaining amount
         outstanding) in excess of that amount.

                  (ii)     All such prepayments shall be made:

                           (A)      upon not less than one Business Day's prior
                  written, email or telephonic notice in the case of Base Rate
                  Loans; and

                           (B)      upon not less than three Business Days'
                  prior written, email or telephonic notice in the case of LIBOR
                  Rate Loans;

         in each case given to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. (New York
         City time) on the date required and, if given by telephone, promptly
         confirmed in writing to the Administrative Agent (and the
         Administrative Agent will promptly transmit such telephonic or original
         notice, by telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender). Upon the giving
         of any such notice, the principal amount of the Second Priority Term
         Loans specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the
         prepayment date specified therein. Any prepayment of any Second
         Priority Term Loan pursuant to this Section shall be applied in inverse
         order of

                                       53
<PAGE>

         maturities and otherwise in accordance with Section 2.12 (General
         Provisions Regarding Payments).

         (b)      Second Priority Term Loan Call Protection.

                  (i)      The Second Priority Term Loans may not be voluntarily
         prepaid at any time on or prior to April 1, 2008;

                  (ii)     The Borrower may, at its option, upon notice as
         provided in clause (a) above, prepay at any time all, or from time to
         time any part of, the Second Priority Term Loans, if such prepayment is
         after April 1, 2008 but on or before April 1, 2009, in an amount equal
         to 103.5% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus all other amounts
         owed hereunder in connection with such prepayment, including amounts
         payable under Sections 2.05 (Interest) and 2.14 (Making or Maintaining
         Second Priority Term Loans) hereof; and

                  (iii)    Subject to clause (a) above, Second Priority Term
         Loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty after April
         1, 2009.

SECTION 2.11. Mandatory Repayment Offers.

         (a)      In the event that, pursuant to Section 5.07 (Asset Sales;
Application of Net Proceeds) or Section 5.12 (Offer to Prepay Upon Change of
Control), the Borrower shall elect to repay or be required to offer to prepay
Second Priority Term Loans, then the Borrower shall make an offer to each Lender
(a "Mandatory Repayment Offer") in accordance with the following the procedures
specified below:

                  (i)      The Mandatory Repayment Offer shall be made by the
         Borrower within 30 days following (A) the receipt by the Borrower or
         any of its Subsidiaries of Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Casualty
         Event or Condemnation Event or (B) a Change of Control, as applicable,
         and shall remain open until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
         specified in such Mandatory Repayment Offer, which date shall be no
         earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such
         Mandatory Repayment Offer was made, except to the extent that a longer
         period is required by applicable law (the "Offer Period");

                  (ii)     The Borrower shall make the Mandatory Repayment Offer
         by sending a notice to the Administrative Agent (for delivery to each
         Lender). The notice shall contain all instructions and materials
         necessary to enable the Lenders to accept the Mandatory Repayment Offer
         for all of their Second Priority Term Loans pursuant to the Mandatory
         Repayment Offer. The Mandatory Repayment Offer shall be made to all
         Lenders. The notice, which shall govern the terms of the Mandatory
         Repayment Offer, shall state:

                           (A)      that the Mandatory Repayment Offer is being
                  made pursuant to this Section 2.11 and Section 5.07 (Asset
                  Sales; Application of Net Proceeds) or Section 5.12 (Offer to
                  Prepay Upon Change of Control), as applicable, and the date on
                  which the Mandatory Repayment Offer shall end;

                                       54
<PAGE>

                           (B)      the total amount the Borrower is offering to
                  prepay (the "Offer Amount") and the Repayment Date therefor;

                           (C)      that, unless the Borrower defaults in making
                  such payment, any Second Priority Term Loan with respect to
                  which a Lender accepts the Mandatory Repayment Offer shall
                  cease to accrue interest from and after the Repayment Date;

                           (D)      that a Lender that accepts a Mandatory
                  Repayment Offer must accept such Mandatory Repayment Offer
                  with respect to all (but not part) of its Second Priority Term
                  Loans (up to the amount of such Lender's Second Priority Term
                  Loans that the Borrower is offering to prepay);

                           (E)      that the Lenders shall be entitled to
                  withdraw their acceptance of a Mandatory Repayment Offer if
                  the Borrower and the Administrative Agent receive, not later
                  than the expiration of the Offer Period, a notice setting
                  forth the name of the Lender, the principal amount of the
                  Second Priority Term Loans for which the Lender previously
                  accepted such Mandatory Repayment Offer and a statement that
                  such Lender is rescinding its acceptance of such Mandatory
                  Repayment Offer; and

                           (F)      in the case of a Mandatory Repayment Offer
                  being made pursuant to Section 5.07 (Asset Sales; Application
                  of Net Proceeds), that if the aggregate principal amount of
                  Second Priority Term Loans for which the Mandatory Repayment
                  Offer is accepted by the Lenders exceeds the Offer Amount,
                  then the Administrative Agent shall select the Second Priority
                  Term Loans to be purchased in accordance with Section 2.12(c)
                  (General Provisions Regarding Payments).

                  (iii)    On or before the fifth day after the termination of
         the Offer Period (the "Repayment Date"), the Borrower shall (A) to the
         extent lawful, pay, in accordance with Section 2.12(c) (General
         Provisions Regarding Payments), the amount of Second Priority Term
         Loans with respect to which the Mandatory Repayment Offer was accepted,
         and (B) deliver to the Administrative Agent (for delivery to the
         Lenders) an Officer's Certificate stating the amount of the Second
         Priority Term Loans to be repaid in accordance with the terms of this
         Section 2.11. The Administrative Agent shall promptly forward the
         appropriate amount to each Lender being repaid.

         (b)      In the event that one or more, but not all, Lenders have not
elected to participate in any Mandatory Repayment Offer made pursuant to Section
5.07 (Asset Sales; Application of Net Proceeds), the Borrower shall, upon the
end of the Offer Period, immediately commence a second Mandatory Repayment Offer
in accordance with the procedure provided in clause (a) of this Section 2.11,
provided that such subsequent offer shall only be made to Lenders who elected to
participate in the initial Mandatory Repayment Offer and, provided, further,
that the Borrower shall not be required to make more than one such subsequent
offer with respect to each initial Mandatory Repayment Offer.

                                       55

SECTION 2.12. General Provisions Regarding Payments.

         (a)      All payments by the Borrower or any Guarantor of principal,
interest, fees and other Second Priority Term Loan Obligations shall be made in
Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any
restriction or condition, and delivered to the Administrative Agent not later
than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date due at the Administrative
Agent's Principal Office for the account of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders, as the case may be. Funds received by the Administrative Agent after
that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by the Borrower or
the applicable Guarantor on the next succeeding Business Day.

         (b)      All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Second
Priority Term Loan shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal
amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any
payments in respect of any Second Priority Term Loan on a date when interest is
due and payable with respect to such Second Priority Term Loan) shall be applied
to the payment of interest before application to principal.

         (c)      The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each
Lender, at such address as such Lender shall indicate in writing, such Lender's
applicable Pro Rata Share of all payments and prepayments of principal and
interest due hereunder, except that prepayment offers accepted by Lenders
pursuant to Section 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment Offer), and in respect of the Net
Proceeds from any Asset Sale, Casualty Event or Condemnation Event, shall be
allocated to the accepting Lenders ratably in proportion to the principal amount
of Second Priority Term Loans outstanding to each accepting Lender (and not to
all Lenders based on Pro Rata Shares), together with all other amounts due
thereon, including all fees payable with respect thereto, to the extent received
by the Administrative Agent.

         (d)      Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to
be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be due on the
next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the
computation of the payment of interest hereunder.

         (e)      The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to
charge the Borrower's accounts (if any) with the Administrative Agent in order
to cause timely payment to be made to the Administrative Agent of all principal,
interest, fees and expenses due hereunder (to the extent there are funds
available in its accounts for that purpose) upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default in respect of its payment obligations
hereunder.

         (f)      The Administrative Agent shall deem any payment by or on
behalf of the Borrower hereunder that is not made in same day funds prior to
1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date therefor to be a non-conforming
payment. Any such payment shall not be deemed to have been received by the
Administrative Agent until the later of (i) the time such funds become available
funds, and (ii) the applicable next Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall
give prompt telephonic notice to the Borrower and each applicable Lender
(confirmed in writing) if any payment is non-conforming. Any non-conforming
payment may constitute or become a Default or Event of Default in accordance
with the terms of Section 7.01 (Events of Default). Interest shall continue to
accrue on any principal as to which a non-conforming payment is made until such
funds become available funds (but in no event less than the period from the date
of

                                       56
<PAGE>

such payment to the next succeeding applicable Business Day) at the rate
determined pursuant to Section 2.07 (Default Interest) from the date such amount
was due and payable until the date such amount is paid in full.

SECTION 2.13. Ratable Sharing. The Lenders hereby agree among themselves that,
except in the case of prepayments pursuant to Section 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment
Offers), if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a
voluntary prepayment of Second Priority Term Loans made and applied in
accordance with the terms hereof), through the exercise of any right of set-off
or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any
right under the Second Priority Term Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate
protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Law,
receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of
principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due and owing to such Lender
hereunder or under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents (collectively,
the "Aggregate Amounts Due" to such Lender) which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such
other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment
shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt
of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase
participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each Lender that
is deemed to be the seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by
such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the
other Lenders, so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be
shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to each of
them, respectively; provided, if all or part of such proportionately greater
payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such
Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, the
foregoing purchases of participations shall be rescinded and the purchase prices
paid for such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender(s)
ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower
expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a
participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien,
set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by the Borrower
to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the
amount of the participation held by that holder.

SECTION 2.14. Making or Maintaining Second Priority Term Loans.

         (a)      Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In the event
that the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall
be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest
error), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Second
Priority Term Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London
interbank market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
interest rate applicable to such Second Priority Term Loans on the basis
provided for in the definition of Adjusted LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent
shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Borrower and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no
Second Priority Term Loans may be made or maintained with an interest rate based
on the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, and instead will be made and maintained with an
interest rate equal to the Base Rate plus 4.75% per annum, until such time as
the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, and (ii) any Funding
Notice or Continuation Notice given by the Borrower with respect to

                                       57
<PAGE>

the Second Priority Term Loans in respect of which such determination was made
shall be deemed to be rescinded by the Borrower.

         (b)      Illegality or Impracticability of using the Adjusted LIBOR
Rate. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which
determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto
but shall be made only after consultation with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its Second
Priority Term Loans with an interest rate based on the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (i)
has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with
any Legal Requirement or would conflict with any treaty, governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the
failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful, or (ii) has become
impracticable, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date hereof
which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market or the
position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such Lender
shall be an "Affected Lender" and on that day it shall give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (A) the
obligation of the Affected Lender to make or maintain Second Priority Term Loans
with an interest rate based on the Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be suspended until
such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (B) to the extent such
determination by the Affected Lender relates to a Second Priority Term Loan then
being requested by the Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Continuation
Notice, the Affected Lender shall make such Second Priority Term Loan as (or
continue such Second Priority Term Loan as) a Second Priority Term Loan with an
interest rate equal to the Base Rate plus 4.75% annum, (C) the Affected Lender's
obligation to maintain its outstanding Second Priority Term Loans with an
interest rate based on the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (the "Affected Loans") shall be
terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then
in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (D)
the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Second Priority Term Loans
with an interest rate equal to the Base Rate plus 4.75% per annum on the date of
such termination. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence,
nothing in this Section 2.14(b) shall affect the obligation of any Lender other
than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Second Priority Term Loans with an
interest rate based on the Adjusted LIBOR Rate in accordance with the terms
hereof.

         (c)      Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest
Periods. The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by such
Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts),
for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid
by such Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Second
Priority Term Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by such Lender
in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds but excluding
loss of anticipated profits (such anticipated profits being the 5.75% spread
over the Adjusted LIBOR Rate) which such Lender may sustain within an Interest
Period: (i) if any prepayment or other principal payment of any of its Second
Priority Term Loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period
applicable to that Second Priority Term Loan (including pursuant to Section 2.10
(Voluntary Prepayments), 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment Offers), 5.07 (Asset Sales;
Application of Net Proceeds) and 5.12 (Offer to Prepay Upon Change of Control);
or (ii) if any

                                       58
<PAGE>

prepayment of any of its Second Priority Term Loans is not made on any date
specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower.

         (d)      Booking of Second Priority Term Loans. Any Lender may make,
carry or transfer Second Priority Term Loans at, to, or for the account of any
of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of such Lender.

         (e)      Assumptions Concerning Funding of Second Priority Term Loans.
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 2.14 and under
Section 2.15 (Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy) shall be made as though such
Lender had actually funded each of its relevant Second Priority Term Loans
through the purchase of a LIBOR deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained
pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Adjusted LIBOR Rate in an amount
equal to the amount of such Second Priority Term Loan and having a maturity
comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such
LIBOR deposit from an offshore office of such Lender to a domestic office of
such Lender in the United States of America; provided, however, each Lender may
fund each of its Second Priority Term Loans in any manner it sees fit and the
foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating
amounts payable under this Section 2.14 and under Section 2.15 (Increased Costs;
Capital Adequacy).

SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy.

         (a)      Compensation For Increased Costs and Taxes. Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.16 (Taxes; Withholding, etc.) (which shall be
controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any
Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any Legal
Requirement, or any change therein or in the interpretation, administration or
application thereof (including the introduction of any new Legal Requirement),
or any determination of a court or governmental authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or
not having the force of law):

                  (i)      imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve
         (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other
         reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar
         requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
         or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit
         extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such
         Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect
         to any Second Priority Term Loans that are reflected in the definition
         of Adjusted LIBOR Rate); or

                  (ii)     imposes any other condition (other than with respect
         to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending
         office) or its obligations hereunder or the London interbank market;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining Second Priority Term Loans hereunder or
to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable
lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such

                                       59
<PAGE>

case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon receipt of the
statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts
(in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating,
interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as
may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or
reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver
to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement,
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional
amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.15(a), which statement shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

         (b)      Capital Adequacy Adjustment. In the event that any Lender
shall have determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or
applicability after the Closing Date of any Legal Requirement (or any provision
thereof) regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) with any
guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a
consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender's Second Priority Term Loans,
or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the
Second Priority Term Loans to a level below that which such Lender or such
controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into
consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with
regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within five Business Days
after receipt by the Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in
the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount
or amounts as shall compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an
after-tax basis for such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such
Lender under this Section 2.15(b), which statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.16. Taxes; Withholding, etc.

         (a)      Payments to Be Free and Clear. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 2.16, all sums payable by or on behalf of any Obligor hereunder and
under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents shall (except to the extent
required by any applicable Legal Requirement) be paid free and clear of, and
without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax imposed, levied,
collected, withheld or assessed by or within the U.S. or any political
subdivision in or of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction from or to which a
payment is made by or on behalf of any Obligor.

         (b)      Withholding of Taxes. If any Obligor or any other Person is
required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any such Tax
from any sum paid or payable by or on behalf of any Obligor to the any Agent or
any Lender under any of the Second Priority Term Loan Documents:

                                       60
<PAGE>

                  (i)      the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of
         any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as
         the Borrower becomes aware of it;

                  (ii)     the Borrower shall pay any such Tax before the date
         on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the
         liability to pay is imposed on any Obligor) for its own account or (if
         that liability is imposed on such Agent or such Lender, as the case may
         be) on behalf of and in the name of such Agent or such Lender;

                  (iii)    the sum payable by such Obligor in respect of which
         the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be
         increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of
         all deductions, withholding or payments for or with respect to Taxes,
         such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date
         a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction,
         withholding or payment been required or made; and

                  (iv)     within 30 days after paying any sum from which it is
         required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30
         days after the due date of payment of any tax which it is required by
         clause (ii) above to pay, the Borrower shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other affected
         parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance
         thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority;

provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to any
Lender under clause (iii) above except to the extent that any change after the
date hereof (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on
the Closing Date) or after the effective date of the Assignment Agreement
pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender)
in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as is mentioned
therein shall result in either the imposition of deduction, withholding or
payment or an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment
from that in effect at the date hereof or at the date of such Assignment
Agreement, as the case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender.

         (c)      Other Taxes. The Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant taxing or other authority in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, and shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.16(b)(iv) with
respect to such payments.

         (d)      Indemnification. Subject to the requirements of Section
2.16(e), the Borrower shall indemnify each Agent and each Lender for the full
amount of Taxes (to the extent the Borrower would be required to pay additional
amounts with respect to such Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16(b)) or Other Taxes
arising in connection with payments made under any of the Second Priority Term
Loan Documents (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
on amounts payable under this Section 2.16) paid by such Agent or Lender and any
penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses arising from or with respect
to such Taxes or Other Taxes, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made
within 10 days from the date any Agent or any Lender makes written demand
therefor.

                                       61
<PAGE>

         (e)      Evidence of Exemption From U.S. Withholding Tax. Each Lender
that is not a United States Person (as such term is defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "Non-U.S.
Lender") shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the
Borrower, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on
the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date of
the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of
each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the
determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (each in the
reasonable exercise of its discretion):

                  (i)      two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
         W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly
         executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under
         the Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish that
         such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States
         federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of
         principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under any of the
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents or is subject to such deduction or
         withholding at a reduced rate; or

                  (ii)     if such Lender is not a "bank" or other Person
         described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Code and is claiming exemption
         from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the
         Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Certificate Re
         Non-Bank Status together with two original copies of Internal Revenue
         Service Form W-8 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly
         executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under
         the Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish that
         such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States
         federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of
         interest payable under any of the Second Priority Term Loan Documents.

Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with
respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this
Section 2.16(e) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by
such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in
time or change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall
promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower
two new original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI , or a
Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8, as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by
such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Code and reasonably
requested by the Borrower to confirm or establish that such Lender is not
subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
respect to payments to such Lender under the Second Priority Term Loan Documents
or is subject to such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate, or notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such
forms, certificates or other evidence. The Borrower shall not be required to pay
any additional amount to any Non-U.S. Lender under Section 2.16(b)(iii) or to
indemnify the Non-U.S. Lender under Section 2.16(d) if such Lender shall have
failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred to in
the second sentence of this

                                       62
<PAGE>

Section 2.16(e), or (2) to notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of
its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence, as the
case may be; provided, if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of
the first sentence of this Section 2.16(e) on the Closing Date or on the date of
the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender, as applicable,
nothing in this last sentence of this Section 2.16(e) shall relieve the Borrower
of its obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b) or
to indemnify the Non-U.S. Lender under Section 2.16(d) in the event that, as a
result of any change in any applicable Legal Requirement, or any change in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer
properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
withholding as described herein. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the
form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this
Agreement indicates a U.S. withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding
tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes.

SECTION 2.17. Removal or Replacement of a Lender. Anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that:

         (a)      (i) any Lender (an "Increased-Cost Lender") shall give notice
to the Borrower that such Lender is an Affected Lender or that such Lender is
entitled to receive payments under Section 2.14 (Making or Maintaining Second
Priority Term Loans), 2.15 (Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy) or 2.16 (Taxes;
Withholding, etc), (ii) the circumstances which have caused such Lender to be an
Increased-Cost Lender or which entitle such Lender to receive such payments
shall remain in effect, and (iii) such Lender shall fail to withdraw such notice
within five Business Days after the Borrower's request for such withdrawal; or

         (b)      in connection with any proposed amendment, modification,
termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof as
contemplated by Section 12.05(b) (Amendments and Waivers), the consent of
Requisite Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of
such other Lenders (each a "Non-Consenting Lender") whose consent is required
shall not have been obtained;

then, with respect to each such Increased-Cost Lender or Non-Consenting Lender
(the "Terminated Lender"), the Borrower may, by giving written notice to the
Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so, elect
to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably
agrees) to assign its outstanding Second Priority Term Loans in full to one or
more Eligible Assignees (each a "Replacement Lender") in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12.06 (Successors and Assigns; Participations); provided,

                  (i)      on the date of such assignment, the Replacement
         Lender shall pay to such Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum
         of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest
         on, all outstanding Second Priority Term Loans of the Terminated
         Lender, and (B) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid,
         fees owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.08 (Fees);

                  (ii)     on the date of such assignment, the Borrower shall
         pay any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section
         2.14(c) (Making or Maintaining Second Priority Term Loans), 2.15
         (Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy) or 2.16 (Taxes; Withholding, etc.);
         provided that no premium on such amounts shall be required to be paid;
         and

                                       63
<PAGE>

                  (iii)    in the event such Terminated Lender is a
         Non-Consenting Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the
         time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such
         Terminated Lender was a Non-Consenting Lender.

Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender, such
Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" under any of the Second
Priority Term Loan Documents; provided, any rights of such Terminated Lender to
indemnification hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         The obligation of any Lender to make a Second Priority Term Loan on the
Closing Date is subject to the satisfaction, or waiver in accordance with
Section 12.05 (Amendments and Waivers), of the following conditions precedent on
or before the Closing Date:

SECTION 3.01. Resolutions. The Administrative Agent shall have received a copy
of one or more resolutions or other authorizations of Holdings, the Borrower and
each Guarantor authorizing, as applicable and among other things, the granting
of the Liens under the Security Documents and the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, in each case
certified by an Officer of each such Person as being (a) in full force and
effect as of the Closing Date and (b) true, correct and complete copies of all
of the resolutions or other authorizations of such Person relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Financing Documents as
of the Closing Date.

SECTION 3.02. Incumbency. The Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate from each of Holdings, the Borrower and each Guarantor, signed by
the appropriate authorized officer of such Person and dated as of the Closing
Date, as to the incumbency of the natural persons authorized to execute and
deliver the Second Priority Term Loan Documents to which such Person is a party.

SECTION 3.03. Formation Documents. The Administrative Agent shall have received
(a) a copy of the certificate of formation, articles of incorporation or other
comparable constituent documents of Holdings, the Borrower and each Subsidiary
of the Borrower, in each case certified by the Secretary of State of the state
of such Person's formation or incorporation (as applicable) and (b) a copy of
the limited liability company operating agreement, bylaws or other comparable
constituent documents of such Person, in each case certified by an Officer of
such Person as being true, correct and complete as of the Closing Date.

SECTION 3.04. Good Standing Certificates. The Administrative Agent shall have
received certificates issued by the Secretary of State of the state in which
each of Holdings, the Borrower, and each Subsidiary of the Borrower is formed or
organized (as applicable), (a) dated no more than five days prior to the Closing

<PAGE>

SECTION 3.05. Financial Officer's Certificate. The chief financial officer of
the Borrower shall have furnished a certificate, dated the Closing Date, in form
and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, stating to the effect
that:

                  (a)      The present fair saleable value of the assets of each
         of the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Borrower (other than CalGen
         Finance) exceeds the amount required to pay the probable liability on
         its existing debts, respectively (whether matured or unmatured,
         liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent), as they
         become absolute and matured, and as a result of the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated herein and in the Bank Book, will continue to
         exceed such amount;

                  (b)      Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the
         Borrower (other than CalGen Finance) does not, and, as a result of the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the
         other Financing Documents and the Bank Book, will not, have
         unreasonably small capital for it to carry on its business as proposed
         to be conducted;

                  (c)      Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary of the
         Borrower (other than CalGen Finance) is incurring obligations or making
         transfers under any evidence of indebtedness with the intent to hinder,
         delay or defraud any entity to which it is or will become indebted; and

                  (d)      Nothing has come to the Borrower's attention to cause
         it to believe that: (i) R.W. Beck is not qualified to pass on questions
         relating to the technical, environmental and economic aspects of the
         projects operated by the CalGen Companies as such projects are
         described in the Bank Book; (ii) the assumptions included in R.W.
         Beck's report dated March 15, 2004, entitled "Independent Engineer's
         Report, Calpine Generating Company, LLC Facilities" (the "Beck
         Report"), are not reasonable; (iii) the information provided by the
         CalGen Companies to R.W. Beck in connection with the Beck Report was
         not prepared in good faith by the CalGen Companies; and (iv) the
         factual information or the conclusions contained in the Beck Report are
         inaccurate in any material adverse respect.

SECTION 3.06. Security.

                  (a)      Release. The Collateral Agent shall have received:

                           (i)      certified copies of Uniform Commercial Code

Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made (other than
any information that was corrected or updated in writing by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders prior to the Closing Date).

         (b)      The Projections are based on good faith estimates and
assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable as of the
date of the Projections, and there are no statements or conclusions in any of
the Projections which are based upon or include information known to the
Borrower to be misleading in any material respect or which fail to take into
account material information regarding the matters reported therein. The
Borrower believes that the Projections are reasonable on the Closing Date, it
being acknowledged and agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
however, that projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and
that the actual results during the period or periods covered by the Projections
may differ from the projected results and such differences may be material.

         (c)      Except as expressly set forth in this Section 4.13, neither
the Borrower nor any Guarantor makes any representation with respect to any
information, projections, forecasts, statements of opinion, expectations or
beliefs of any party contained in the Bank Book or delivered in connection with
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

SECTION 4.14. Adverse Change. Except as has been disclosed in the Bank Book,
together with the other documents, certificates and other writings delivered to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
Guarantor specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, since December 31, 2003 there has been no material adverse change, nor
any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the
condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and, except as has been
disclosed in writing to the Administrative Agent, no long-term indebtedness has
been incurred (other than long-term indebtedness that is expressly contemplated
by the Bank Book), and no dividend or distribution of any kind has been
declared, paid or made by Borrower on any class of its equity interests.

SECTION 4.15. Taxes. Each of the Borrower, each Subsidiary of the Borrower and
Holdings has timely filed (or caused to be filed timely) all federal, material
state and material local tax returns and reports that are required to be filed
by it. All material taxes, assessments, utility charges, fees and other
governmental charges imposed on it have been timely paid (other than those taxes
that it is contesting in good faith and by appropriate proceedings). All such
tax

                                       74
<PAGE>

returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. Except for Permitted
Liens, no material tax Lien has been filed, and to the knowledge of the Borrower
and each Guarantor, no claim is being asserted, with respect to any such taxes,
assessments, charges or fees. To the extent any taxes, assessments, charges and
fees are being contested, the Borrower or the applicable Guarantor has
established reserves that are adequate for the payment thereof in conformity
with GAAP.

SECTION 4.16. Investment Company Act. None of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or

and each ERISA Affiliate thereof has fulfilled its obligations (if any) under
the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code for each ERISA Plan, (ii)
each such Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the currently
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and (iii) neither the Borrower nor
any ERISA Affiliate thereof has incurred any liability to the PBGC or an ERISA
Plan or Multiemployer Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premiums due in the ordinary course). None of the assets of the Borrower or any
ERISA Affiliate thereof, constitute assets of an employee benefit plan within
the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary thereof maintains, or has at any point of its existence maintained,
any employee-benefit plans that were subject to ERISA.

SECTION 4.18. Governmental Regulation.

         (a)      None of the Borrower or any "subsidiary company," as that term

writings delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by or on behalf
of the Borrower or any Guarantor specifically for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (B) as a QF under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended ("PURPA"), as contemplated by 18
C.F.R. Section 292.601(c); or (iii) under any state law or regulation with
respect to rates or the financial or organizational regulation of electric
utilities, other than, with respect to Subsidiaries of the Borrower that are
QFs, as contemplated by 18 C.F.R. Section 292.602(c).

         (b)      Other than as described in the Bank Book, each of the power
generation projects in which the Borrower's Subsidiaries listed on Schedule
4.18(b) have an interest meets the requirements under PURPA and the regulations
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

                                       75
<PAGE>

(the "FERC") promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to time, necessary to
be a "qualifying cogeneration facility" and/or a "qualifying small power
generation production facility".

         (c)      Each of the Borrower's Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.18(c)
(i) own and/or operate Eligible Facilities within the meaning of Section 32 of
PUHCA, and each such Subsidiary has received a determination from the FERC, not
subject to any pending challenge or appeal, that it is an EWG, within the
meaning of Section 32 of PUHCA; and (ii) other than as described in the Bank
Book, together with the other documents, certificates and other writings
delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Guarantor specifically for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, has validly issued orders from the FERC, not
subject to any pending challenge, investigation, or proceeding (other than the
FERC's generic proceeding initiated in Docket No. EL01-118-000), (A) authorizing
such Subsidiary to engage in wholesale sales of electricity, ancillary services
and, to the extent permitted under its market-based rate tariff, other services
at market-based rates, and (B) granting such waivers and blanket authorizations
as are customarily granted to entities with market-based rate authority; with
respect to each such Subsidiary, the FERC has not imposed any rate caps or
mitigation measures other than rate caps and mitigation measures generally
applicable to similarly situated marketers or generators selling electricity,
ancillary services or other services at wholesale in the geographic market where
such Subsidiary conducts its business.

         (d)      Each of the Borrower's Subsidiaries that are participating in
the Texas wholesale electric market has registered with the Texas Public
Utilities Commission ("TPUC"), and the TPUC has not imposed on the Borrower any
specific rate cap or mitigation measures.

         (e)      Other than as described in the Bank Book, together with the
other documents, certificates and other writings delivered to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor
specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
there are no pending complaints filed with the FERC seeking abrogation or
modification of a contract for the sale of power by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.19. Margin Stock, Etc. None of the transactions contemplated by this

contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or
other material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or
any of its properties may be bound.

SECTION 4.21. Solvency. The present fair saleable value of the assets of each of
the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Borrower exceeds the amount required to
pay the probable liability on its existing debts, respectively (whether matured
or unmatured, liquidated or

                                       76
<PAGE>

unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent), as they become absolute and
matured, and as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein and in the Bank Book, will continue to exceed such amount.

SECTION 4.22. Capitalization. Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary of the
Borrower does not, and, as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents
and the Bank Book, will not, have unreasonably small capital for it to carry on
its business as proposed to be conducted.

SECTION 4.23. Other Indebtedness. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary of the
Borrower is incurring obligations or making transfers under any evidence of
indebtedness with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which it
is or will become indebted.

Guarantor covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not
at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now
or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Agreement; and each of the Borrower and each Guarantor (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any

                  governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not
                  materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those

                  refinanced;

                           (H)      Liens securing Indebtedness otherwise

                  obligations under this Agreement, and, in the written opinion
                  of the president, chief operating officer or chief financial

         Credit Facilities and effect a corresponding commitment reduction
         thereunder, and (B) the incurrence by the Borrower (and the guarantee
         by its Subsidiaries) of Indebtedness and letters of credit under Credit

         amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed $100,000,000 less the aggregate
         amount of all Net Proceeds of Asset Sales, Casualty Events and
         Condemnation Events applied by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         since the Closing Date to repay any term Indebtedness under any such
         Credit Facility or to repay, or cash collateralize letters of credit
         under, any revolving Indebtedness under any such Credit Facility and
         effect a corresponding commitment reduction thereunder;

                  (ii)     the incurrence by the Borrower, CalGen Finance and

                           (A)      any Expansion Debt incurred by the Excluded
                  Subsidiary is recourse only to the Expansion Assets financed
                  with such Expansion Debt and to other Expansion Assets owned
                  by the Excluded Subsidiary (including any rights of the
                  Excluded Subsidiary under Shared Facilities Arrangements);

                           (B)      if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
                  Borrower's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
                  which internal financial statements are available immediately
                  preceding the date on which the Expansion Debt is incurred
                  would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a Pro Forma
                  basis as if the Expansion Debt had been incurred at the
                  beginning of such period and the proceeds therefrom had been
                  applied as intended to be applied (but without giving effect
                  to the completion of any construction projects unless actual
                  completion has been achieved), at least 25% of the cost of
                  such Expansion Assets is financed with Equity Contributions or
                  the proceeds of Perpetual Preferred Stock or Affiliate
                  Subordinated Indebtedness;

                           (C)      if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
                  Borrower's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
                  which internal financial statements are available immediately
                  preceding the date on which the Expansion Debt is incurred
                  would have been less than 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a Pro
                  Forma basis as if the Expansion Debt had been incurred at the
                  beginning of such period and the proceeds therefrom had been
                  applied as intended to be applied (but without giving effect
                  to the completion of any construction projects unless actual
                  completion has been achieved);

                                    (1)      at least 40% of the cost of such
                           Expansion Assets is financed with Equity
                           Contributions or the proceeds of Perpetual Preferred
                           Stock or Affiliate Subordinated Indebtedness; and

                                    (2)      after giving effect to such
                           incurrence, the amount of Expansion Debt incurred
                           pursuant to this clause (iii), together with the
                           aggregate amount of all other Expansion Debt then
                           outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing
                           Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance,
                           replace, defease or discharge any Expansion Debt
                           incurred pursuant to this clause (iii), does not
                           exceed $250,000,000;

                  (iv)     the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or

                                       82
<PAGE>

         was permitted by this Agreement to be incurred under clauses (ii),
         (iii), (iv) or (x) of this Section 5.06(b);

                  (v)      the incurrence by the Borrower or any Guarantor of
         intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Borrower and any
         Guarantors that is subordinated in right of payment to all Secured
         Obligations on the terms set forth on Exhibit A hereto and is not
         secured other than by unperfected security interests; provided,
         however, that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity
         Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person
         other than the Borrower or a Guarantor and (B) any sale or other
         transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the
         Borrower or a Guarantor will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an
         incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as
         the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (v); and
         provided, further, that any such intercompany Indebtedness must be
         included in the Collateral.

                  (vi)     the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations, in connection with Permitted Debt
         or otherwise, in the ordinary course of business and not for
         speculative purposes; provided, that (A) such Hedging Obligations will
         have tenors that expire on or prior to the maturity date (or other
         expiration) of the underlying Obligation being hedged, and (B) any such
         Hedging Obligations hedging or managing interest rate risk with respect
         to a particular series of Notes or loans under this Agreement, the
         First Priority Term Loan Agreement or the Revolving Loan Agreement will
         have tenors that expire on or prior to the Stated Maturity of the
         applicable Notes or loans;

                  (vii)    the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its

         claims, self-insurance obligations, bankers' acceptances, and
         performance and surety bonds in the ordinary course of business;

                  (viii)   the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or
         other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument
         inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such
         Indebtedness is covered within five Business Days;

                  (ix)     the incurrence by the Borrower of (a) Affiliate
         Subordinated Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to
         exceed $250,000,000 at any one time outstanding and (b) Working Capital
         Facility Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
         $750,000,000 at any one time outstanding; and

                  (x)      the incurrence by the Borrower of Third Party
         Subordinated Indebtedness; provided, that:

                           (A)      the Net Proceeds of the Third Party
                  Subordinated Indebtedness are applied:

                                    (1)      to acquire all or substantially all
                           of the assets of, or any Equity Interests in, a
                           business that constitutes a Permitted Business,
                           provided, that in the case of an acquisition of
                           Equity Interests, the business

                                       83
<PAGE>

                           is or becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower and a
                           Guarantor concurrently with such acquisition;

                                    (2)      to make a capital expenditure;

                                    (3)      to acquire other assets that are
                           not classified as current assets under GAAP and that
                           are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

                                    (4)      any combination of the foregoing;
                           and

                           (B)      the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
                  Borrower's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
                  which internal financial statements are available immediately
                  preceding the date on which the Third Party Subordinated
                  Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0,
                  determined on a Pro Forma basis as if the Third Party
                  Subordinated Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning
                  of such period and the proceeds therefrom had been applied as
                  intended to be applied (but without giving effect to the
                  completion of any construction projects unless actual
                  completion has been achieved).

         (c)      The Borrower shall not incur, and shall not permit any
Subsidiary to incur, any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Borrower or such Subsidiary unless such Indebtedness is also contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Second Priority Term Loans, the
applicable Second Priority Term Loan Guarantees and the other Second Priority
Term Loan Obligations on substantially identical terms or on terms that are more
favorable to the Lenders hereunder; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will
be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior basis.

         (d)      For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 5.06,
in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more
than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (i) through
(x) of Section 5.06(b), the Borrower will be permitted to classify such item of
Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion
of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section
5.06. The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified
Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock
will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of
Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section 5.06. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 5.06, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Borrower or any Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or
currency values.

SECTION 5.07. Asset Sales; Application of Net Proceeds.

         (a)      Asset Sales. The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

                                       84
<PAGE>

                  (i)      except with respect to an Asset Sale made pursuant to
         the Existing Purchase Option, the Borrower (or any of its Subsidiaries,
         as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset
         Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity
         Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of;

                  (ii)     at least 90% of the consideration received in the
         Asset Sale by the Borrower or such Subsidiary is in the form of cash.
         For purposes of this provision, each of the following shall be deemed
         to be cash:

                           (A)      any liabilities, as shown on the Borrower's
                  most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Borrower or any
                  of its Subsidiaries (other than contingent liabilities and
                  liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Second
                  Priority Term Loans and the Second Priority Term Loan
                  Guarantees) that are assumed by the transferee of any such
                  assets pursuant to a customary novation or similar agreement
                  that releases the Borrower or such Subsidiary from further
                  liability;

                           (B)      any securities, notes or other obligations
                  received by the Borrower or any such Subsidiary from such
                  transferee that are promptly, subject to ordinary settlement
                  periods, converted by the Borrower or such Subsidiary into
                  cash, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion;
                  and

                           (C)      in connection with the exercise by a
                  purchaser of an Existing Purchase Option, any amount owed by
                  the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary to the purchaser
                  under the agreement containing such Existing Purchase Option
                  that is set off by the purchaser against the purchase price;

                  (iii)    if the assets disposed of in such Asset Sale include
         any component of a Facility that is necessary for the operation of such
         Facility, the Asset Sale involves the disposition of such Facility as a
         whole; and

                  (iv)     if the Asset Sale involves the sale of a Facility or
         all or substantially all the assets of a Facility, (A) such Asset Sale
         is to a Person other than an Affiliate of the Borrower, and (B) all
         necessary and appropriate amendments are made to those Major Project
         Documents applicable to such Facility to remove such Facility from the
         scope of such Major Project Documents.

         (b)      Application of Net Proceeds. The Borrower (or the applicable
Subsidiary, as the case may be) shall apply the Net Proceeds from each Asset
Sale, Casualty Event or Condemnation Event, as follows:

                  (i)      to the Lenders under this Agreement and all other
         holders of the First Priority Lien Obligations (to the extent required
         under the applicable First Priority Lien Documents), to purchase,
         prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of such First Priority
         Lien Obligations that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of such
         Net Proceeds (taking into account any mandatory purchase, prepayment or
         redemption of First Priority Lien Obligations required under any First
         Priority Lien Document);

                                       85
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     if any such Net Proceeds remain after the offer (and,
         if applicable, reoffer) to holders of First Priority Lien Obligations
         (and any mandatory purchase, prepayment or redemption of First Priority
         Lien Obligations) in accordance with clause (i) above, to all holders
         of the Second Priority Lien Obligations (to the extent required under
         the applicable Second Priority Lien Documents), to purchase, prepay or
         redeem the maximum principal amount of such Second Priority Lien
         Obligations that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of such
         remaining Net Proceeds (taking into account any mandatory purchase,
         prepayment or redemption of Second Priority Lien Obligations required
         under any Second Priority Lien Document); and

                  (iii)    if any such Net Proceeds remain after the offer (and,
         if applicable, reoffer) to holders of Second Priority Lien Obligations
         (and any mandatory purchase, prepayment or redemption of Second
         Priority Lien Obligations) in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii)
         above, to all holders of the Third Priority Lien Obligations (to the
         extent required under the applicable Third Priority Lien Documents), to
         purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of such Third
         Priority Lien Obligations that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed
         out of such remaining Net Proceeds (taking into account any mandatory
         purchase, prepayment or redemption of Third Priority Lien Obligations
         required under any Third Priority Lien Document).

         (c)      Mandatory Repayment Offer. The Borrower is required to and
shall effectuate each repayment of the Second Priority Term Loans by commencing
a Mandatory Repayment Offer as described in Section 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment
Offers).

         (d)      Excess Proceeds; Pro Rata Basis. In the event that any Net
Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Casualty Event or Condemnation Event remain after
the Borrower has made a Mandatory Repayment Offer (and, if applicable, reoffer)
in accordance with Section 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment Offers) and such Net
Proceeds have otherwise been applied in accordance with clause (b) above, then
the Borrower may use such remaining Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Financing Documents, including the making of Restricted
Payments. If the aggregate principal amount of all Secured Obligations having
the same priority that are to be prepaid under clause (b) above exceeds the
amount of Net Proceeds available therefor, then the Borrower will select the
Secured Obligations to be purchased, pro rata based on the aggregate principal
amount of all of such Secured Obligations to be prepaid.

SECTION 5.08. Transactions with Affiliates.

         (a)      The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract,
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate of the Borrower (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless:

                  (i)      the Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole with all
         other related Affiliate Transactions, is on terms that are no less
         favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, than
         those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
         Borrower or such Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

                                       86
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent
         (other than with respect to a Shared Facilities Arrangement between or
         among only the Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries):

                           (A)      with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or
                  series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
                  consideration in excess of $10,000,000 but less than or equal
                  to $25,000,000, a resolution of the Board of Directors set
                  forth in an Officer's Certificate certifying that such
                  Affiliate Transaction complies with this Section 5.08 and that
                  such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of
                  the Board of Directors; and

                           (B)      with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or
                  series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
                  consideration in excess of $25,000,000, a positive opinion as
                  to the Fair Market Value of such Affiliate Transaction issued
                  by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of
                  national standing.

         (b)      The following items shall not be deemed to be Affiliate
Transactions and, therefore, shall not be subject to the provisions of Section
5.08(a):

                  (i)      any employment agreement, employee benefit plan,
         officer and director indemnification agreement or any similar
         arrangement entered into by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in
         the ordinary course of business;

                  (ii)     transactions between or among the Borrower and/or any
         of the Guarantors (other than Shared Facilities Arrangements);

                  (iii)    transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of
         the Borrower (but not a Subsidiary of the Borrower) solely because the
         Borrower owns, directly or through a Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in,
         or controls, such Person;

                  (iv)     payment of reasonable directors' fees to Persons who

                  (v)      any issuance of Equity Interests (other than
         Disqualified Stock) of the Borrower to Affiliates of the Borrower;
         provided that such Equity Interests are included in the Collateral;

                  (vi)     Restricted Payments that do not violate the

                  (ix)     transactions under or pursuant to written agreements
         with Affiliates of the Borrower in place as of the date of this
         Agreement or any amendment or modification

<PAGE>

         thereto, so long as any such amendment or modification meets the
         requirements of clause (x) or (xi) of this Section 5.08(b);

                  (x)      any amendments or modifications of, or waivers under,
         any written agreement described under clause (ix) of this 5.08(b) that
         is not a Major Project Document; provided that no such amendment,
         modification or waiver alters any such agreement in a manner than is
         materially adverse to the interests of the Lenders;

                  (xi)     any amendments or modifications of, or waivers under,
         any Major Project Document, which are permitted by Section 5.10(b)
         (Business Activities) and are on terms that are no less favorable to
         the Borrower or its relevant Subsidiary (as certified to the
         Administrative Agent in an Officer's Certificate) than those that would
         have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Borrower or such
         Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

                  (xii)    any agreement to do any of the foregoing.

SECTION 5.09. Liens. The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Lien of any kind on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, except
Permitted Liens.

SECTION 5.10. Business Activities.

         (a)      The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than Permitted Businesses, except
to such extent as would not be material to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

         (b)      The Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
perform all their obligations under the Major Project Documents, and the
Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, terminate,
amend or otherwise modify, or consent to any termination, amendment or
modification of, or grant any waiver under, any Major Project Document, unless
any failure to so perform or any such termination, amendment, modification or
waiver would not, when taken together with all other such failures to perform,
terminations, amendments, modifications and waivers since the Closing Date, be
Materially Adverse, as evidenced by a certificate of the chief financial officer
of the Borrower; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph will
not apply to any amendment, modification or termination of any Major Project
Document required under this Agreement in connection with an Asset Sale.

         (c)      The Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
obtain and maintain all permits and approvals necessary for the construction and
operation of the Facilities, including applicable exemptions from PUHCA, unless
the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (d)      The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, use or dispose of any hazardous materials or allow any
hazardous materials to be brought onto or stored or used on or transported to or

practices and in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, except to
the

                                       88
<PAGE>

extent such non-compliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 5.11. Payments for Consent. The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any
consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of any Second Priority Term

waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation
documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

(Mandatory Repayment Offers) that require the Borrower to make a Mandatory
Repayment Offer following a Change of Control shall be applicable whether or not
any other provisions of this Agreement are applicable; provided that, the
Borrower shall not be required to make a Mandatory Repayment Offer upon a Change
of Control if a third party makes the Mandatory Repayment Offer in the manner,
at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this
Agreement applicable to a Mandatory Repayment Offer required upon a Change of
Control and repays all Second Priority Term Loans (and the other amounts
required to be paid pursuant to clause (a) above).

SECTION 5.13. Restrictions on Activities of CalGen Finance. The Borrower shall
not permit CalGen Finance to hold any material assets, become liable for any
material obligations or engage in any significant business activities; provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, CalGen Finance
may be a co-obligor or guarantor with respect to Indebtedness if the Borrower is
an obligor on such Indebtedness and the net proceeds of such Indebtedness are
received by the Borrower, CalGen Finance or one or more of the Borrower's other
Subsidiaries.

(iii) deliver or cause to be delivered an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent within 30 days of the date on which it
was acquired or created, and (b) all real and personal property of that
Subsidiary will become part of the Collateral within 30

other documents) reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent.

SECTION 5.15. Limitation on Issuances and Sales of Equity Interests in
Subsidiaries.

         (a)      The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, transfer, convey, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any
Equity Interests in any Subsidiary of the Borrower to any Person (other than the
Borrower or a Guarantor), unless:

                  (i)      such transfer, conveyance, sale, lease or other
         disposition is of all the Equity Interests in such Subsidiary; and

                  (ii)     the Net Proceeds from such transfer, conveyance,
         sale, lease or other disposition are applied in accordance with
         Sections 2.11 (Mandatory Offers) and 5.07 (Asset Sales; Application of
         Net Proceeds).

         (b)      The Borrower shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to issue

constituting directors' qualifying shares) to any Person other than to the
Borrower or a Guarantor.

companies, insurance on their property, including the Collateral, in at least
such amounts, with such deductibles and against at least such risks as is
customary for companies of the same or similar size engaged in the same or
similar businesses as those of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and furnish to
the Administrative Agent, upon written request, full information as to such
Persons' property and liability insurance carriers. The Borrower shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause all their insurance policies to name the
Lenders, as a class, as additional insureds with waiver of subrogation and shall
cause all its, and its Subsidiaries', property and casualty policies to name the

interests may appear), with the right to receive 30 days notice of any
cancellation of or material change in such insurance policies.

SECTION 5.18. Coverage Ratio; Kilowatt Test.

greater than 1.05:1.0.

         (b)      Consolidated First and Second Priority Lien Debt to Kilowatt

Loans and Second Priority Notes, to (b) the combined Estimated

                                       90
<PAGE>

Peak Capacity of all the Facilities (including all Facilities in operation and
under construction) owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (expressed in
kilowatts) to be equal to or less than $235 per kilowatt.

SECTION 5.19. Further Assurances; Ratings. The Borrower and each Guarantor shall
perform such reasonable acts as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this
Agreement and the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents promptly after
written request by the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall, as promptly as
practical after the date hereof, perform all reasonable acts as may be necessary
to cause Moody's to issue a credit rating in respect of the Second Priority Term
Loans.

SECTION 5.20. Suspension of Certain Covenants. In the event that, from time to
time, after giving effect to the suspension of covenants and the event of
default provided for in this Section 5.20, the Third Priority Fixed Rate Notes
and the Third Priority Floating Rate Notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moody's
and BBB- or better by S&P, then the covenants contained in Section 5.04
(Restricted Payments), Section 5.05 (Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Subsidiaries), Section 5.06 (Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
of Preferred Equity), Section 5.10 (Business Activities), Section 5.16 (Deposit

                                   SUCCESSORS

SECTION 6.01. Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets.

         (a)      The Borrower shall not, directly or indirectly: (i)
consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Borrower is
the surviving entity); (ii) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another
Person; or (iii) lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in
one or more related transactions, to any other Person; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not apply to:

                  (i)      a merger of the Borrower with an Affiliate solely for
         the purpose of reconstituting the Borrower in another jurisdiction; or

                  (ii)     any sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, lease or
         other disposition of assets between or among the Borrower and the
         Guarantors.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower is permitted to
reorganize as a corporation or a limited liability company in accordance with
the procedures established in this Agreement, provided that the Borrower shall
have delivered to the Administrative Agent an Opinion of Counsel in the United
States reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent confirming that such
reorganization is not adverse to the Lenders (it being recognized that such

                                       91
<PAGE>

reorganization shall not be deemed adverse to the Lenders solely because (i) of
the accrual of deferred tax liabilities resulting from such reorganization or
(ii) the successor or surviving corporation (A) is subject to income tax as a
corporate entity or (B) is considered to be an "includable corporation" of an
affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of the Code or any similar
state or local law).

SECTION 6.02. Successor Corporation Substituted. Upon any consolidation or
merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower in a
transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the provisions of,
Section 6.01 (Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets), the successor
corporation formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Borrower is
merged or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and
after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance or other
disposition, the provisions of this Agreement referring to the "Borrower" shall
refer instead to the successor corporation and not to the Borrower), and may
exercise every right and power of the Borrower under this Agreement with the
same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Borrower herein;
provided, however, that the predecessor Borrower shall not be relieved from the
obligation to pay the principal of and interest on or other amounts in respect
of the Second Priority Term Loans.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

SECTION 7.01. Events of Default.

         Each of the following is an "Event of Default":

         (a)      default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the
Second Priority Term Loans;

         (b)      default in payment when due of the principal of, or premium,
if any, on the Second Priority Term Loans;

         (c)      failure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to comply
with Section 5.07 (Asset Sales; Application of Net Proceeds), 5.12 (Offer to
Prepay Upon Change of Control) or 5.16 (Deposit of Revenues);

         (d)      failure by Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
for 30 days after written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
holding at least 50% in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Second
Priority Term Loans then outstanding to comply with any of the agreements in
this Agreement or the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents;

         (e)      default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under
which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any
Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or
the payment of which is guaranteed by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries)
whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date
of this Agreement, if that default:

                                       92
<PAGE>

                  (i)      is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or
         interest or premium, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the
         expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the
         date of such default (a "Payment Default"); or

                  (ii)     results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness
         prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with
the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
$25,000,000 or more, and such default shall not have been cured or waived or any
such acceleration rescinded, or such Indebtedness repaid, within 20 days of the
Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary becoming aware of such default;

         (f)      failure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to pay
final judgments aggregating in excess of $25,000,000 (excluding those covered by
insurance), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of
60 days;

         (g)      the repudiation by Holdings, the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries of any of its obligations under the Security Documents or the
unenforceability of the Security Documents against Holdings, the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries for any reason; provided that such repudiation or
unenforceability relates to Collateral having a Fair Market Value of $25,000,000
or more;

         (h)      except as permitted by this Agreement, any Second Priority
Term Loan Guarantee shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable
or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any
Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or
disaffirm its obligations under its Second Priority Term Loan Guarantee, and
such condition shall not have been cured within 30 days after written notice
from the trustee or the holders of at least 50% in aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Second Priority Term Loans;

         (i)      breach by any Person (other than the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries) of its obligations under, or termination or failure to be in full
force and effect of, a Major Project Document (unless such breach, termination
or failure to be in full force and effect would not, when taken together with
all other such breaches, terminations or failures since the date of this
Agreement (other than those that have been cured as contemplated below,
including by entering into a replacement agreement), be Materially Adverse, as
evidenced by a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Borrower),
unless with respect to any Major Project Document such breach is cured, or such
Major Project Document is replaced with a substantially similar agreement (it
being understood that (a) an agreement will be considered substantially similar
if it would not be Materially Adverse and (b) the use of an Affiliate of the
Borrower as the counterparty under an agreement replacing the Index Hedge will
not by itself be considered Materially Adverse), within 60 days thereafter (or
120 days with respect to the Interest Hedge); and

                                       93
<PAGE>

         (j)      the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, suffer a Bankruptcy Event.

SECTION 7.02. Acceleration. In the case of an Event of Default specified in
clause (j) of Section 7.01 (Events of Default), with respect to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, the outstanding Second Priority Term Loans shall become
due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent or the Requisite
Lenders may declare all the Second Priority Term Loans to be due and payable
immediately. Upon any such declaration, the Second Priority Term Loans shall
become due and payable immediately.

SECTION 7.03. Other Remedies.

         (a)      Subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent may pursue any
available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations or to enforce the
performance of this Agreement and any other Second Priority Term Loan Document.

         (b)      The Administrative Agent may maintain a proceeding even if it
does not possess any of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations. A delay or
omission by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are
cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

SECTION 7.04. Waiver of Past Defaults; Rescission. The Requisite Lenders by
notice to the Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders waive an
existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder. Upon any
such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this
Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or
Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. The Requisite Lenders,
by written notice to the Administrative Agent, may on behalf of all of the
Lenders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default
(except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely
because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.

SECTION 7.05. Control by Majority. The Requisite Lenders may direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Administrative Agent or exercising any trust or power conferred
on it. However, the Administrative Agent may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law, this Agreement, the other Second Priority Term Loan
Documents, that the Administrative Agent determines may be unduly prejudicial to
the rights of other Lenders, that may involve the Administrative Agent in
personal liability, or that is inconsistent with the Collateral Trust Agreement.

SECTION 7.06. Collection Suit by Administrative Agent. If an Event of Default
specified in Section 7.01(a) or (b) (Events of Default) occurs and is
continuing, the Administrative Agent is authorized to recover judgment in its
own name and as trustee of an express trust against the

                                       94
<PAGE>

Borrower for the whole amount of principal of, premium, if any, and interest
remaining unpaid on the Second Priority Term Loans and interest on overdue
principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall
be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent, its agents and counsel.

SECTION 7.07. Priorities.

         Subject to the Collateral Trust Agreement, if the Administrative Agent
collects any money pursuant to this Article VII, it shall pay out the money in
the following order:

                  First: to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on a pro
         rata basis, their respective agents and attorneys for amounts due under
         this Agreement and the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents,
         including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities
         incurred, and all advances made, by the Administrative Agent or any of
         the Lenders and the costs and expenses of collection;

                  Second: to the Lenders for amounts due and unpaid on the
         Second Priority Term Loan Obligations for principal, premium, if any,
         and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind,
         according to the amounts due and payable on the Second Priority Term
         Loan Obligations for principal, premium, if any and interest,
         respectively; and

                  Third: to the Borrower or to such party as a court of
         competent jurisdiction shall direct.

         The Administrative Agent may fix a record date and payment date for any
payment to the Lenders pursuant to this Section 7.07.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                                     AGENTS

SECTION 8.01. Appointment of Agents. The Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge
and agree that MSSF has acted and shall be credited as sole lead arranger of the
Second Priority Term Loans. The Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge and agree
that MSSF has acted and shall be credited as sole bookrunner of the Second
Priority Term Loans and that MSSF is hereby appointed Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents. The Borrower
and each Lender hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the Collateral
Agent with respect to the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations, and each Lender
authorizes the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent to enter into and
perform their respective obligations under the Collateral Trust Agreement. Each
Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as its agent in
accordance with the terms hereof and the other Second Priority Term Loan
Documents. The Administrative Agent hereby agrees to act upon the express
conditions contained herein and the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents,
as applicable. The provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the benefit of
the Agents and the Lenders and no Obligor shall have any rights as a third party
beneficiary of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its functions and
duties hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall act

                                       95
<PAGE>

solely as an agent of the Lenders and no Agent does or shall assume or be deemed
to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with
or for the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. MSSF in its capacity as the sole
lead arranger and bookrunner shall not have any duties, liabilities or
obligations under the Second Priority Term Loan Documents but shall be entitled
to all benefits of this Article VIII.

SECTION 8.02. Powers and Duties. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent
to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers, rights
and remedies hereunder and under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents
as are specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Each Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities
that are expressly specified herein and in the other Second Priority Term Loan
Documents. Each Agent may exercise such powers, rights and remedies and perform
such duties by or through its agents or employees. No Agent shall have, by
reason hereof or any of the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents, a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing herein or any of
the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended
to or shall be so construed as to impose upon any Agent any obligations in
respect hereof or any of the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents except as
expressly set forth herein or therein.

SECTION 8.03.     General Immunity.

         (a)      No Responsibility for Certain Matters. No Agent shall be
responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency hereof or any other
Second Priority Term Loan Document or for any representations, warranties,
recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral
statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or
certificates or any other documents furnished or made by any Agent to the
Lenders or by or on behalf of any Obligor to any Agent or any Lender in
connection with the Second Priority Term Loan Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby or for the financial condition or business affairs of any
Obligor or any other Person liable for the payment of any Second Priority Term
Loan Obligations, nor shall any Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions,
covenants or agreements contained in any of the Second Priority Term Loan
Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Second Priority Term Loans or
as to the existence or possible existence of any Material Adverse Effect, Event
of Default or Default or to make any disclosures with respect to the foregoing.
Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of
outstanding Second Priority Term Loans or the component amounts thereof.

         (b)      Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent nor any of its officers,
partners, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to the Lenders for any
action taken or omitted by any Agent under or in connection with any of the
Second Priority Term Loan Documents except to the extent caused by such Agent's
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Agent shall be entitled
to refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to
take an action) in connection herewith or any of the other Second Priority Term
Loan Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested
in it hereunder or thereunder

                                       96
<PAGE>

unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof
from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such
instructions under Section 12.05 (Amendments and Waivers)) and, upon receipt of
such instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may
be), such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from
acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with
such instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i)
each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and
shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and
judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by
it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any
Agent as a result of such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from
acting hereunder or any of the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents in
accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as
may be required to give such instructions under Section 12.05 (Amendments and
Waivers)).

SECTION 8.04. Agents Entitled to Act as Lender. The agency hereby created shall
in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties
or obligations upon, any Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder.
With respect to its participation in the Second Priority Term Loans, each Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as if it were not performing the duties and functions
delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" shall, unless the context
clearly otherwise indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity. Any
Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities
of, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or
other business with the Borrower or any of its Affiliates as if it were not
performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from the Borrower for services in connection herewith and
otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

SECTION 8.05. Lenders' Representations, Warranties and Acknowledgment.

         (a)      Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries in connection with its Second Priority Term Loans hereunder
and that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the
creditworthiness of the CalGen Companies. No Agent shall have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such
investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of the Lenders or to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming
into its possession before the making of the Second Priority Term Loans or at
any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with
respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to
the Lenders.

         (b)      Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this
Agreement and funding its Second Priority Term Loan on the Closing Date, shall
be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each
Second Priority Term Loan Document and each other

                                       97
<PAGE>

document required to be approved by any Agent, Requisite Lenders or the Lenders,
as applicable on the Closing Date.

SECTION 8.06. Right to Indemnity. Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata
Share, severally agrees to indemnify each Agent, to the extent that such Agent
shall not have been reimbursed by any Obligor, for and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of
any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against such Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing
its duties hereunder or under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents or
otherwise in its capacity as such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents; provided, no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from such Agent's bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
If any indemnity furnished to any Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional indemnity is furnished; provided, in no event
shall this sentence require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any
liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof; and
provided further, this sentence shall not be deemed to require any Lender to
indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement described in the proviso
in the immediately preceding sentence.

SECTION 8.07. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the
Lenders and the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any
time with or without cause by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing
delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Requisite Lenders. Upon any such notice of resignation or any such removal, the
Requisite Lenders shall have the right, upon five Business Days' notice to the
Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent; provided, that the
Borrower shall have the right to approve any such successor Administrative Agent
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Upon the acceptance
of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent and the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent shall promptly transfer to such successor Administrative
Agent all sums, together with all records and other documents necessary or
appropriate in connection with the performance of the duties of the successor
Administrative Agent under the Second Priority Term Loan Documents, whereupon
such retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring or removed Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions
of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent hereunder.

SECTION 8.08. Withholding Tax.

                                       98
<PAGE>

         (a)      To the extent required by any applicable Legal Requirement,
the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender an
amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax, including any withholding
tax resulting from any Lenders' failure to deliver the forms or other
documentation as required by Section 2.16(e) (Taxes; Withholding, etc). Nothing
in this Section 8.08 shall relieve the Borrower of its obligation with respect
to Taxes and Other Taxes provided in Section 2.16 (Taxes; Withholding, etc.).

         (b)      If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
(because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or
because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff
costs and any out of pocket expenses.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                             COLLATERAL AND SECURITY

         The Collateral Agent's Liens upon the Collateral shall no longer secure
the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations outstanding under this Agreement, and
the right of the Lenders to the benefits and proceeds of the Collateral Agent's
Liens on Collateral shall terminate and be discharged:

                  (a)      on the Second Priority Term Loan Secured Obligations
         Termination Date; or

                  (b)      with the prior written consent of each Lender whose
         consent is required under Section 12.05.

Nothing in this Article IX shall be deemed to restrict the Collateral Agent's
rights to release liens on Collateral in accordance with the terms of the
Collateral Trust Agreement or as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE X.

                     RANKING OF LIENS AND COLLATERAL SHARING

         EACH LENDER AND EACH AGENT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE
THEIR RESPECTIVE LIEN PRIORITIES, THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL,
THE EXERCISE OF REMEDIES UNDER THE SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN DOCUMENTS,
AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS TO THE SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND OTHER
MATTERS RELATED TO THE COLLATERAL ARE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE COLLATERAL
TRUST AGREEMENT. Each Lender and each Agent, by delivering its signature page
hereto, funding

                                       99
<PAGE>

its Second Priority Term Loan on the Closing Date and/or executing an Assignment
Agreement (as the case may be), shall be deemed to have (a) acknowledged receipt
of, consented to and approved the Collateral Trust Agreement and (b) authorized
the Agents to perform their respective obligations thereunder. Each Lender and
each Agent further acknowledges that, in certain circumstances related to
intercreditor and security matters, the Collateral Trust Agreement provides
that, where lenders and/or noteholders hold the same series of Obligations (such
as the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations and the Obligations under the
Second Priority Notes), such lenders and noteholders will vote as a single
class, and the agent or trustee for such lenders or noteholders, as applicable,
will vote the obligations of such lenders or noteholders, as applicable, as a
class (and not by percentage of lenders or noteholders voting for or against the
applicable intercreditor or security matter). Accordingly, in such circumstances
under the Collateral Trust Agreement, if the Requisite Lenders hereunder do (or
do not) consent, approve, waive or otherwise provide direction to the
Administrative Agent with respect to any request, decision, action, or
otherwise, then the Administrative Agent shall vote 100% of the Second Priority
Term Loan Obligations in favor of such consent, approval or waiver (or rejection
thereof), as applicable, all in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Trust Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE XI.

                       SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN GUARANTEE

SECTION 11.01. Guarantee.

         (a)      Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.22 (No
Recourse Against the Borrower or the Guarantors) and in Section 11.01(b), the
Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably,
guarantee to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders making the
Second Priority Term Loans and their respective successors, endorsees,
transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance by the
Borrower and each other Guarantor when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations;

         (b)      Each Guarantor, and by its making of a Second Priority Term
Loan on the Closing Date, each Lender, hereby confirms that it is the intention
of all such parties that the Second Priority Term Loan Guarantee(s) of such
Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of
Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any
Second Priority Term Loan Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree
that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount
that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent
and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and
after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from
or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the
obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article XI, result in the
obligations of such Guarantor under its Second Priority Term Loan Guarantee not
constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

                                      100
<PAGE>

         (c)      Each Guarantor agrees that the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the
liability of such Guarantor under this Article XI without impairing the
guarantee of such Guarantor to the extent provided in this Article XI or
affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party hereunder.

         (d)      The guarantee provided in this Article XI shall remain in full
force and effect until the Second Priority Term Loan Secured Obligations
Termination Date.

         (e)      With respect to each Guarantor, no payment made by the
Borrower, any of the other Guarantors or any other Person, or received or
collected by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party from the
Borrower, any of the other Guarantors or any other Person, by virtue of any
action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time
or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of any Second Priority Term
Loan Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect
the liability of such Guarantor hereunder, which Guarantor shall,
notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by such Guarantor
in respect of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations or any payment received
or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations), remain liable for the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations
outstanding from time to time hereunder up to the maximum amount of such
Guarantor's liability hereunder until the Second Priority Term Loan Secured
Obligations Termination Date.

SECTION 11.02. Right of Contribution.

         (a)      Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a
Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made
hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution
from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its
proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 11.04 (No Subrogation).

         (b)      The provisions of this Section 11.02 shall in no respect limit
the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and
the other Second Priority Term Loan Secured Parties, and each Guarantor shall
remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the other Second Priority Term
Loan Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.

SECTION 11.03. Subordination. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Article XI, (a) all existing and future indebtedness of, or other obligations
owed by, the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries to any Guarantor is hereby
subordinated to all Second Priority Term Loan Obligations, and (b) without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such subordinated
indebtedness (including interest thereon) shall not be paid or withdrawn in
whole or in part, nor shall any Guarantor accept any payment of or on account of
any such indebtedness while the guarantee provided hereunder is in effect. Any
payment by the Borrower or any subsidiary thereof in violation of this Section
11.03 shall be received by the relevant Guarantor in trust for the
Administrative Agent and the Second Priority Term Loan Secured Parties, and such
Guarantor shall cause the same to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Second Priority Term Loan Secured Parties immediately upon demand
by the Administrative

                                      101
<PAGE>

Agent on account of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations. No Guarantor
shall assign all or any portion of such indebtedness while the guarantee
provided hereunder remains in effect except upon prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent and pursuant to an agreement by which the assignee of any
such indebtedness agrees that the assignment is made subject to the terms of
this Agreement, and that any attempted assignment of such indebtedness in
violation of the provisions hereof shall be void. Nothing in this Section 11.03
shall apply to any repayment of existing or future indebtedness or obligation,
distribution, withdrawal of capital or any other payment of any kind or nature
whether in cash, in kind, or otherwise, that is permitted to be made to the
Guarantor or any of its Affiliates pursuant to and in accordance with the
Financing Documents.

SECTION 11.04. No Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment made by any Guarantor
hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, no Guarantor shall be entitled
to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral
security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party for the payment of the Secured Obligations, nor shall any
Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the
Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor
hereunder, until the Second Priority Term Loan Secured Obligations Termination
Date. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such
subrogation rights at any time when all of the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such
Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the other Second Priority
Term Loan Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and
shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the
Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly endorsed
by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied
against the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations, whether matured or unmatured,
in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine, subject to the terms
and provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

SECTION 11.05. Amendments, etc. with respect to the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations. Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding
that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice
to or further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the
Second Priority Term Loan Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such other
Secured Party and any of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations continued,
and the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations, or the liability of any other
Person upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee
therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in
whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated,
compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party, and any of the Second Priority Term Loan Documents may be
amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the
requisite parties thereto deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral
security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party for the payment of the Second Priority Term
Loan Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any
obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it
as security for the

                                      102
<PAGE>

Second Priority Term Loan Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this
Article XI or any property subject thereto.

SECTION 11.06. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional.

         (a)      Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Article XI or acceptance of the
guarantee contained in this Article XI. Each Guarantor agrees that the Second
Priority Term Loan Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to
have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or
waived, in reliance upon the Second Priority Term Loan Guarantees. Each
Guarantor agrees that all dealings between the Borrower and any of the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on
the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Article XI. Each
Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice
of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the Guarantors with
respect to the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations.

         (b)      The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are primary
obligations of such Guarantor and are an absolute, unconditional, continuing and
irrevocable guaranty of payment and performance of the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations and the other obligations of Guarantor hereunder and not of
collectibility, and are in no way conditioned on or contingent upon any attempt
to enforce in whole or in part Holdings', the Borrower's or any CalGen Company's
liabilities and obligations to the Secured Parties. Each failure by a Guarantor
to pay or perform, as the case may be, a Second Priority Term Loan Obligation or
any other obligation hereunder shall give rise to a separate cause of action
hereunder, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action
arises.

         (c)      The Second Priority Term Loan Secured Parties may, at any time
and from time to time (whether or not after revocation or termination of the
guarantee contained in this Article XI) without the consent of or notice to any
Guarantor, except such notice as may be required by the Second Priority Term
Loan Documents or applicable law which cannot be waived, without incurring
responsibility to any Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations
of any Guarantor hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole
or in part:

                  (i)      change the manner, place and terms of payment or
         performance of, or renew or alter, any Second Priority Term Loan
         Obligation or any obligations and liabilities (including any of those
         hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or
         hereof, or in any manner modify, amend or supplement the terms of the
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents or any documents, instruments or
         agreements executed in connection therewith, in each case with the
         consent of Holdings, the Borrower, the CalGen Companies and any
         Guarantor (in each case, as and to the extent required by this
         Agreement or the relevant Security Document, as applicable), and the
         agreements and guarantees herein made shall apply to the Second
         Priority Term Loan Obligations or such other obligations as changed,
         extended, renewed, modified, amended, supplemented or altered in any
         manner;

                                      103
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
         against the Borrower, Holdings, any CalGen Company, or others
         (including any Guarantor) or otherwise act or refrain from acting;

                  (iii)    add or release any other guarantor from its
         obligations without affecting or impairing the obligations of any
         Guarantor hereunder;

                  (iv)     settle or compromise any Second Priority Term Loan
         Obligations or any obligations and liabilities (including any of those
         hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or
         hereof, and may subordinate the payment or performance of all or any
         part thereof to the payment or performance of any obligations and
         liabilities which may be due to the Secured Parties or others;

                  (v)      sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or
         otherwise deal with in any manner or in any order any property by
         whomsoever pledged or mortgaged to secure or securing the Second
         Priority Term Loan Obligations or any liabilities or obligations
         (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in
         respect thereof or hereof and/or any offset there against;

                  (vi)     apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever
         realized to any obligations and liabilities of Holdings, the Borrower
         or any CalGen Company to the Second Priority Term Loan Secured Parties
         under the Second Priority Term Loan Documents in the manner provided
         therein regardless of what obligations and liabilities remain unpaid,
         except that sums paid by any Guarantor hereunder shall be deemed to
         have been paid in respect of the applicable obligation of such
         Guarantor hereunder;

                  (vii)    consent to or waive any breach of, or any act,
         omission or default under, the Second Priority Term Loan Documents or
         otherwise amend, modify or supplement (with the consent of the
         Guarantors, Holdings, the Borrower and the CalGen Companies, as and to
         the extent required by the Second Priority Term Loan Documents) the
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents or any of such other instruments or
         agreements; and/or

                  (viii)   act or fail to act in any manner referred to in this
         Agreement which may deprive any Guarantor of its right to subrogation
         against the Borrower or any CalGen Company to recover full indemnity
         for any payments or performances made pursuant to this Agreement or of
         its right of contribution against any other party.

         (d)      No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the Second
Priority Term Loan Obligations or invalidity, irregularity, unenforceability or
non-perfection of any collateral therefor, shall affect, impair or be a defense
to the guarantee contained in this Article XI, which is a primary obligation of
each Guarantor.

         (e)      The guarantee provided hereunder is a continuing guarantee and
all obligations to which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be
conclusively presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. In the event
that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.06(b) above, the guarantee
provided by any Guarantor hereunder shall be deemed revocable in accordance with
applicable law, then any such revocation shall become effective only upon
receipt by Administrative Agent of written notice of revocation signed by such
Guarantor. To

                                      104
<PAGE>

the extent permitted by applicable law, no revocation or termination hereof
shall affect, in any manner, rights arising under hereunder with respect to
Second Priority Term Loan Obligations arising prior to receipt by Administrative
Agent of written notice of such revocation or termination. Any such revocation
or termination shall be deemed to be an Event of Default.

SECTION 11.07. Waiver. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives and relinquishes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, all rights and remedies accorded to sureties or guarantors and
agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies,
including:

         (a)      any right to require Administrative Agent or the other Secured
Parties to proceed against the Borrower, any CalGen Company or any other Person
or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Administrative Agent or
any other Secured Party at any time or to pursue any other remedy in
Administrative Agent's or any other Secured Party's power before proceeding
against such Guarantor;

         (b)      any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack
of power or authority, death, dissolution, merger, termination or disability of
such Guarantor, the Borrower, any other CalGen Company or any other Person or
the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to file or
enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other
proceeding) of such Guarantor, Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company or any
other Person;

         (c)      promptness, diligence, demand, presentment, protest and notice
of any kind, including notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new
or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the
part of Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company, the Administrative Agent,
the other Secured Parties, any endorser or creditor of the foregoing or on the
part of any other Person under this or any other instrument in connection with
any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by the Administrative Agent or
the other Secured Parties as collateral or in connection with any Second
Priority Term Loan Obligation;

         (d)      any defense based upon an election of remedies by the
Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties, including an election to
proceed by non-judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or
otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of such Guarantor, the right of such
Guarantor to proceed against Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company or
another Person for reimbursement, or both;

         (e)      any defense based on any offset against any amounts which may
be owed by any Person to such Guarantor for any reason whatsoever;

         (f)      any defense based on any act, failure to act, delay or
omission whatsoever on the part of Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company or
any of the Borrower's Affiliates or the failure by Holdings, the Borrower, any
CalGen Company or any of the Borrower's Affiliates to do any act or thing or to
observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement to be observed or
performed by it under the Financing Documents;

                                      105
<PAGE>

         (g)      any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which
provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in
other respects more burdensome than that of the principal;

         (h)      any defense setoff or counterclaim which may at any time be
available to or asserted by Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company or any of
the Borrower's Affiliates thereof against the Administrative Agent, the other
Secured Parties or any other Person under the Financing Documents;

         (i)      any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party to disclose to such Guarantor any facts any Secured Party may now
or hereafter know about Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company or the
Facilities, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
Party has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the risk
beyond that which such Guarantor intends to assume, or have reason to believe
that such facts are unknown to such Guarantor, or have a reasonable opportunity
to communicate such facts to such Guarantor, since such Guarantor acknowledges
that such Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the
financial condition of the Borrower and of all circumstances bearing on the risk
of non-payment or non-performance of any Second Priority Term Loan Obligation;

         (j)      any defense based on any change in the time, manner or place
of any payment or performance under, or in any other term of, this Agreement or
any other Financing Document, or any other amendment, renewal, extension,
acceleration, compromise or waiver of or any consent or departure from the terms
of this Agreement or any other Financing Document;

         (k)      any right to assert the bankruptcy or insolvency of Holdings,
the Borrower, any CalGen Company or any other Person as a defense hereunder or
as the basis for rescission hereof and any defense arising because of the
Administrative Agent's or any other Secured Party's election, in any proceeding
instituted under the Bankruptcy Law, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of
the Bankruptcy Law;

         (l)      any defense based upon any borrowing or grant of a security
interest under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Law; and

         (m)      any other circumstance (including any statute of limitations),
any act or omission by Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company, or any
existence of or reliance on any representation by the Administrative Agent,
Holdings, the Borrower, any CalGen Company or any Secured Party that might
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, any guarantor or
surety (other than, subject to Section 11.08 (Bankruptcy), the defense of
payment or performance of the applicable Obligations guaranteed hereunder).

SECTION 11.08. Bankruptcy.

         (a)      The obligations of any Guarantor under the guarantee provided
in this Article XI shall not be altered, limited or affected by any proceeding,
voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
receivership, liquidation or arrangement of Holdings, the Borrower, any other
Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof, or by any defense which Holdings,

                                      106
<PAGE>

the Borrower, any Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof may have by reason of any
order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any
such proceeding.

         (b)      Each Guarantor shall file, in any bankruptcy or other
proceeding in which the filing of claims is required or permitted by law, all
claims which such Guarantor may have against Holdings, the Borrower or any
CalGen Company relating to any indebtedness of the Borrower or any CalGen
Company to such Guarantor, and hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent (for
the benefit of itself and the Lenders) all rights of such Guarantor thereunder.
If any Guarantor does not file any such claim, the Administrative Agent, as
attorney-in-fact for such Guarantor, is hereby authorized to do so in the name
of such Guarantor or, in the Administrative Agent's discretion, to assign the
claim to a nominee and to cause proofs of claim to be filed in the name of the
Administrative Agent's nominee. The foregoing power of attorney is coupled with
an interest and cannot be revoked. The Administrative Agent or its nominee shall
have the sole right to accept or reject any plan proposed in any such proceeding
and to take any other action which a party filing a claim is entitled to take.
In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the
person authorized to pay such a claim shall pay the same to the Administrative
Agent to the extent of any Second Priority Term Loan Obligations which then
remain unpaid or unperformed, and, to the full extent necessary for that
purpose, each Guarantor hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent all of such
Guarantor's rights to all such payments or distributions to which such Guarantor
would otherwise be entitled; provided, however, that such Guarantor's
obligations hereunder shall not be satisfied except to the extent that the
Administrative Agent receives cash by reason of any such payment or
distribution. If the Administrative Agent receives anything hereunder other than
cash, the same shall be held as collateral for amounts due under the guarantee
contained in this Article XI.

         (c)      Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent it may
do so under applicable Legal Requirements, any protection to which it may be
entitled under Sections 365(c)(1), 365(c)(2) and 365(e)(2) of the Bankruptcy Law
or equivalent provisions of the laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction
with respect to any proceedings, or any successor provision of law of similar
import, in the event of any Bankruptcy Event with respect to Holdings, the
Borrower or any CalGen Company. Specifically, in the event that the trustee (or
similar official) in a Bankruptcy Event with respect to Holdings, the Borrower
or any CalGen Company or the debtor-in-possession takes any action (including
the institution of any action, suit or other proceeding for the purpose of
enforcing the rights of Holdings, the Borrower, or any Guarantor under this
Agreement or any Security Document), no Guarantor shall assert any defense,
claim or counterclaim denying liability hereunder on the basis that this
Agreement or any Security Document is an executory contract or a "financial
accommodation" that cannot be assumed, assigned or enforced or on any other
theory directly or indirectly based on Section 365(c)(1), 365(c)(2) or 365(e)(2)
of the Bankruptcy Law, or equivalent provisions of the law or regulations of any
other jurisdiction with respect to any proceedings or any successor provision of
law of similar import. If a Bankruptcy Event with respect to Holdings, the
Borrower or any CalGen Company shall occur, each Guarantor agrees, after the
occurrence of such Bankruptcy Event, to reconfirm in writing, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, its pre-petition waiver of any
protection to which it may be entitled under Sections 365(c)(1), 365(c)(2) and
365(e)(2) of the Bankruptcy Law or equivalent provisions of the laws or
regulations of any other jurisdiction with respect to proceedings and, to give
effect to such waiver, each Guarantor consents to the assumption and enforcement
of each provision of the guarantee contained in this

                                      107
<PAGE>

Article XI and any other provision hereof and in any other Second Priority Term
Loan Document by the debtor-in-possession or Holdings', the Borrower's or any
CalGen Company's trustee in bankruptcy, as the case may be.

SECTION 11.09. Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Article XI shall
continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Second Priority Term Loan
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution,
liquidation or reorganization of Holdings, the Borrower or any Guarantor, or
upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator
of, or trustee or similar officer for, Holdings, the Borrower or any Guarantor
or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such
payments had not been made.

SECTION 11.10. Payments. Each Guarantor shall make all payments due hereunder in
accordance with Section 2.12 (General Provisions Regarding Payments).

                                  ARTICLE XII.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 12.01. Notices. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any
notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given to the
Borrower or any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall be sent to such
Person's address as set forth on Appendix B or in the other relevant Second
Priority Term Loan Document, and in the case of any Lender, the address as
indicated on Appendix B or otherwise indicated to the Administrative Agent in
writing. Each notice hereunder shall be in writing and may be personally served,
telexed or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or courier service and
shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person or by courier
service and signed for against receipt thereof, upon receipt of telefacsimile or
telex, or three Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail with
postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided, no notice to the
Administrative Agent shall be effective until received by the Administrative
Agent. Documents, notices or reports required to be delivered to the Lenders
pursuant to Sections 2.11 (Mandatory Repayment Offers), 5.01(a) (Reports), 5.02
(Compliance Certificate) and 5.12 (Offer to Prepay Upon Change of Control) may
be delivered electronically and posted electronically on IntraLinks/IntraAgency
or other relevant website to which the Lenders have access (whether a
commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by Administrative Agent),
if any; provided that (i) the Administrative Agent shall deliver paper copies of
such reports to any Lender upon written request therefor; and (ii) the
Administrative Agent shall notify (which may be by facsimile or electronic mail)
each Lender of the posting of any such reports and provide to each Lender by
email electronic versions (i.e., soft copies) of such reports.

SECTION 12.02. Expenses.

         The Borrower agrees to pay promptly, without duplication among the
separate clauses of this Section 12.02 and without duplication of amounts paid
under the Purchase Agreement or the Revolving Loan Agreement or any other

Priority Term Loan Documents and the negotiation, preparation and execution of
any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any other
documents or matters requested by the Borrower;

         (c)      all the actual costs and reasonable expenses of creating and
perfecting Liens in favor of Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties pursuant hereto, including filing and recording fees, expenses and

reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to each Agent and of
counsel providing any opinions that any Agent or Requisite Lenders may request
in respect of the Collateral or the Liens created pursuant to the Security

reasonably required in connection with the administration or enforcement of this
Agreement;

         (e)      all the actual costs and reasonable expenses (including the
reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any appraisers, consultants,
advisors and agents employed or retained by Collateral Agent and its counsel)
reasonably required in connection with the custody or preservation of any of the
Collateral; and

         (f)      after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, all

Obligations of or in collecting any payments due from any Obligor hereunder or
under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents by reason of such Default or
Event of Default (including in connection with the sale of, collection from, or
other realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Second
Priority Term Loan Guarantees) or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided hereunder in the nature of a
"work-out" or pursuant to any Bankruptcy Case or Insolvency Proceeding.

SECTION 12.03. Indemnity.

         (a)      In addition to the payment of costs and expenses pursuant to
Section 12.02 (Expenses), whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consummated, the Borrower and the Guarantors agree to defend (subject
to Indemnitees' selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and each of their respective Affiliates and
each and all of the directors, officers, partners, trustees, employees,
attorneys and agents, and (in each case) their respective heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns (each of the foregoing, an "Indemnitee")
from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, no Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to any Indemnified
Liability to the extent such Indemnified Liability is found by a final and
nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
directly and primarily from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                                      109
<PAGE>

         (b)      All amounts due under Section 12.03(a) shall be payable not
later than 10 days after written demand therefor.

         (c)      To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay
and hold harmless set forth in Section 12.03(a) may be unenforceable in whole or
in part because they are violative of any law or public policy, the Borrower and
the Guarantors shall contribute the maximum portion that they are permitted to
pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

         (d)      The Borrower and the Guarantors shall not assert any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for any lost profits or
special, indirect or consequential damages or (to the fullest extent lawful) any
punitive damages arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement or any other Second Priority Term Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument or transaction contemplated hereby or relating in any respect to any
Indemnified Liability, and the Borrower and the Guarantors hereby forever waive,
release and agree not to sue upon any claim for any such lost profits or
special, indirect, consequential or (to the fullest extent lawful) punitive
damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist
in its favor.

         (e)      The agreements in this Section 12.03 shall survive repayment
of the Second Priority Term Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 12.04. Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by the
Borrower and the Guarantors at any time or from time to time subject to the
consent of the Administrative Agent, without prior written notice to such Person
or to any other Person (other than the Administrative Agent), any such notice
being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any
and all deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by
certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust
accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Guarantor against and on
account of the obligations and liabilities of such party to such Lender
hereunder, and under the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents, including
all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected hereto, or
with any other Second Priority Term Loan Document, irrespective of whether or
not (a) such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) the principal of
or the interest on the Second Priority Term Loans or any other amounts due
hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Article II and although
such obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or
unmatured.

SECTION 12.05. Amendments and Waivers.

         (a)      Requisite Lenders' Consent. Subject to Section 12.05(e), no
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Second

therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of
the Requisite Lenders and any additional consents required by Sections 12.05(b)
and (c).

<PAGE>

         (b)      Affected Lenders' Consent. No amendment, modification,
termination, or consent shall be effective if the effect thereof would:

                  (i)      extend the scheduled final maturity of any Second
         Priority Term Loan or Second Priority Term Loan Note outstanding to any
         Lender without the prior written consent of that Lender;

                  (ii)     waive, reduce or postpone any scheduled repayment
         (but not prepayment) due to any Lender without the prior written
         consent of that Lender;

                  (iii)    reduce the rate of interest on any Second Priority
         Term Loan (other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate
         applicable to any Second Priority Term Loan pursuant to Section 2.07
         (Default Interest)) payable to any Lender or reduce or extend any fee
         payable hereunder to any Lender without the prior written consent of
         that Lender;

                  (iv)     reduce the principal amount of any Second Priority
         Term Loan outstanding to any Lender without the prior written consent
         of that Lender;

                  (v)      amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of
         this Section 12.05(b), as it applies to any Lender without the prior
         written consent of that Lender;

                  (vi)     amend the definition of "Requisite Lenders" or "Pro
         Rata Share" without the prior written consent of all Lenders;

                  (vii)    release any Collateral from the Liens created by the
         Security Documents, except as specifically provided for in this
         Agreement and the Security Documents, without the prior written consent
         of all Lenders;

                  (viii)   release any Guarantor from its obligations under its
         Second Priority Term Loan Guarantee(s) or otherwise consent to the
         assignment or transfer by any Obligor of any of its rights and
         obligations under any Second Priority Term Loan Document without the
         prior written consent of all Lenders; or

                  (ix)     amend or modify any provision which requires pro rata
         payments among and as between the Lenders without the prior written
         consent of all Lenders

         (c)      Other Consents. No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of the Second Priority Term Loan Documents, or consent
to any departure by any Obligor therefrom, shall amend, modify, terminate or
waive any provision of Article VIII as the same applies to the Administrative
Agent, or any other provision hereof as the same applies to the rights or
obligations of any Agent, in each case without the consent of the Administrative
Agent.

         (d)      Execution of Amendments, etc. The Administrative Agent may,
but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute
amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of such Lender. Any
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on

                                      111
<PAGE>

any Obligor in any case shall entitle any Obligor to any other or further notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment, modification,
termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this Section 12.05
shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender
and, if signed by an Obligor, on such Obligor.

         (e)      Certain Amendments. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions
of this Section 12.05, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may amend or
supplement the Second Priority Term Loan Documents without the consent of any
Lender:

                  (i)      to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

                  (ii)     to provide for the assumption of the Borrower's
         obligations to the Lenders by a successor to the Borrower pursuant to
         Article VI hereof;

                  (iii)    to make any change that would provide any additional
         rights or benefits to the Lenders or that does not adversely affect the
         legal rights hereunder of any Lender;

                  (iv)     to allow any Subsidiary of the Borrower to provide a
         Second Priority Term Loan Guarantee or allow any Guarantor to execute a
         supplemental Guarantee with respect to the Second Priority Term Loan
         Obligations;

                  (v)      to make, complete or confirm any grant of Collateral
         permitted or required by this Agreement or any of the Security
         Documents or any release of Collateral that becomes effective as set
         forth in this Agreement or any of the Security Documents;

                  (vi)     to conform the text of this Agreement, the Second
         Priority Term Loan Notes or the Security Documents to any provision of
         the Description of New Term Loans or Description of Notes section of
         the Offering Memorandum to the extent that such provision of the
         Description of New Term Loans or Description of Notes section of the
         Offering Memorandum was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
         provision of this Agreement, the Second Priority Term Loans or the
         Security Documents; or

                  (vii)    to reflect any waiver or termination of any right
         arising under the provisions of this Agreement that otherwise would be
         enforceable by any holder of the Notes, if such waiver or termination
         is set forth in the indentures governing such Notes, provided that no
         such waiver or amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the
         Lenders.

SECTION 12.06. Successors and Assigns; Participations.

         (a)      Generally. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of the Lenders and
the other parties hereto. No Obligor's rights or obligations hereunder nor any
interest therein may be assigned or delegated by any Obligor without the prior
written consent of all Lenders. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent
expressly contemplated

                                      112

hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Second Priority Term Loan
Commitment or Second Priority Term Loan (including any Second Priority Term Loan
represented by a Second Priority Term Loan Note) shall be effective, in each
case, unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or
transfer thereof shall have been delivered to and accepted by the Administrative
Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in Section 12.06(e). Prior to
such recordation, all amounts owed with respect to the applicable Second
Priority Term Loan Commitment or Second Priority Term Loan shall be owed to the
Lender listed in the Register as the owner thereof, and any request, authority
or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the
corresponding Second Priority Term Loan Commitments or Second Priority Term
Loans.

to sell, assign or transfer all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, including all or a portion of its Second Priority Term Loan
Commitment or Second Priority Term Loans owing to it or other Second Priority
Term Loan Obligation (provided, however, that each such assignment shall be of a
uniform, and not varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in
respect of any Second Priority Term Loan and any related Second Priority Term
Loan Commitments):

                  (i)      to any Person meeting the criteria of clause (a) of
         the definition of the term of "Eligible Assignee" upon the giving of
         notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent; and

                  (ii)     to any Person meeting the criteria of clause (b) of
         the definition of the term of "Eligible Assignee";

provided, further each such assignment pursuant to this Section 12.06(c) shall
be in an aggregate amount of not less than $1,000 (or such lesser amount as may
be agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or as shall constitute
the aggregate amount of the Second Priority Term Loan Commitments and Second
Priority Term Loans outstanding to the assigning Lender).

         (d)      Mechanics; Fee. The assigning Lender and the assignee thereof
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement,
together with such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect
to United States federal income tax withholding matters as the assignee under
such Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 2.16(e) (Taxes; Withholding, etc.).

         (e)      Notice of Assignment. Upon its receipt of a duly executed and
completed Assignment Agreement (and any forms, certificates or other evidence
required by this

                                      113
<PAGE>

Agreement in connection therewith), the Administrative Agent shall record the
information contained in such Assignment Agreement in the Register, shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and shall maintain a copy of such
Assignment Agreement.

         (f)      Representations and Warranties of Assignee. Each Lender, upon
execution and delivery hereof or upon executing and delivering an Assignment
Agreement, as the case may be, and without limiting any other representation or
warranty contained in any such Assignment Agreement, represents and warrants as
of the Closing Date or as of the applicable Effective Date (as defined in the
applicable Assignment Agreement) that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) it
has experience and expertise in the making of or investing in commitments or
loans such as the applicable Second Priority Term Loan Commitments or Second
Priority Term Loans, as the case may be; and (iii) it shall make or invest in,
as the case may be, its Second Priority Term Loan Commitments or Second Priority
Term Loans for its own account in the ordinary course of its business and
without a view to distribution of such Second Priority Term Loan Commitments or
Second Priority Term Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject
to the provisions of this Section 12.06, the disposition of such Second Priority
Term Loan Commitments or Second Priority Term Loans or any interests therein
shall at all times remain within its exclusive control).

         (g)      Effect of Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Section 12.06, as of the "Effective Date" specified in the applicable
Assignment Agreement:

                  (i)      the assignee thereunder shall have the rights and
         obligations of a "Lender" hereunder to the extent such rights and
         obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
         Assignment Agreement and shall thereafter be a party hereto and a
         "Lender" for all purposes hereof;

                  (ii)     the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
         that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned thereby
         pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other
         than any rights which survive the termination hereof under Section
         12.08 (Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements) and be
         released from its obligations hereunder (and, in the case of an
         Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations hereunder, such Lender shall
         cease to be a party hereto; provided, anything contained in any of the
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding,
         such assigning Lender shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of
         all indemnities hereunder as specified herein with respect to matters
         arising out of the prior involvement of such assigning Lender as a
         Lender hereunder); and

                  (iii)    if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of
         any Second Priority Term Loan Note hereunder, the assigning Lender
         shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly
         thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Second Priority
         Term Loan Notes to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and
         thereupon the Borrower shall issue and deliver new Second Priority Term
         Loan Notes, if so requested by the assignee and/or assigning Lender, to
         such assignee and/or to such assigning Lender, with appropriate
         insertions, to reflect the new outstanding Second Priority Term Loans
         of the assignee and/or the assigning Lender.

                                      114
<PAGE>

         (h)      Participations. Each Lender shall have the right at any time
to sell one or more participations to any Person (other than the Borrower, any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates) in all or any part of
its Second Priority Term Loans or in any other Second Priority Term Loan
Obligation. The holder of any such participation, other than an Affiliate of the
Lender granting such participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender
to take or omit to take any action hereunder except with respect to any
amendment, modification or waiver that would:

                  (i)      extend the final scheduled maturity of any Second
         Priority Term Loan or Second Priority Term Loan Note in which such
         participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of
         payment of interest or fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver
         of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or
         reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the
         participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it
         being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall
         not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an
         increase in any Second Priority Term Loan shall be permitted without
         the consent of any participant if the participant's participation is
         not increased as a result thereof);

                  (ii)     consent to the assignment or transfer by any Obligor
         of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement; or

                  (iii)    release all or substantially all of the Collateral
         under the Security Documents (except as expressly provided in the
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents) supporting the Second Priority
         Term Loan Obligations hereunder in which such participant is
         participating.

The Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.14(c) (Making or Maintaining Second Priority Term Loans), 2.15
(Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy) and 2.16 (Taxes; Withholding, etc.) to the
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section; provided, (i) a participant shall not
be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 (Making or
Maintaining Second Priority Term Loans) or 2.15 (Increased Costs; Capital
Adequacy) than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the
participation to such participant is made with the Borrower's prior written
consent and (ii) a participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 (Taxes;
Withholding, etc.) unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to
such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower,
to comply with Section 2.16 (Taxes; Withholding, etc.) as though it were a
Lender. To the extent permitted by law, each participant also shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 12.04 (Set-Off) as though it were a Lender, provided
such participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 (Ratable Sharing) as
though it were a Lender.

         (i)      Certain Other Assignments.

                  (i)      In addition to any other assignment permitted
         pursuant to this Section 12.06, any Lender may assign and/or pledge all
         or any portion of its Second Priority Term Loans, the other Second
         Priority Term Loan Obligations owed by or to such

                                      115

<PAGE>

         Lender, and its Second Priority Term Loan Notes, if any, to secure
         obligations of such Lender including (A) to any Federal Reserve Bank as
         collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors
         of the Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such
         Federal Reserve Bank and (B) with respect to any Lender that is a fund
         that invests in bank loans, to any trustee or holder of obligations
         owed, or securities issued by, such fund as security for such
         obligations or securities or to any other representative of such
         holders; provided, no Lender, as between the Borrower and such Lender,
         shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of
         any such assignment and pledge, and provided further, in no event shall
         the applicable Federal Reserve Bank, trustee or such holder of
         obligations be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require
         the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

                  (ii)     At the request of the Borrower in connection with the
         payment in full of all of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations,
         whether by voluntary or mandatory prepayment thereof or on the Maturity
         Date or otherwise, each Lender shall execute and deliver to the
         Borrower (or to such Person(s) as the Borrower requests) such documents
         and instruments as the Borrower reasonably requests to assign all of
         such Lender's Second Priority Term Loan Obligations (together with all
         of such Lender's right, title and interest in, to and under all the
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents) to such Person(s) as the Borrower
         may direct; provided, that (A) upon the effectiveness of such
         assignment the Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender an
         instrument pursuant to which the Borrower and the Guarantors release
         such Lender from all claims under this Agreement and all of the other
         Second Priority Term Loan Documents and (B) such assignment shall be
         without recourse to and without any representations or warranties from
         the assigning Lender. If any such assignment occurs after the issuance
         to it of any Second Priority Term Loan Notes hereunder, then upon the
         effectiveness of such assignment, the assigning Lender shall deliver
         all of its Second Priority Term Loan Notes to the Borrower for
         cancellation or re-issuance to the new Lender.

SECTION 12.07. Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception
to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not
avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken
or condition exists.

SECTION 12.08. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. All
agreements made herein shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and the
making of any Second Priority Term Loan. Notwithstanding anything herein or
implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of the Borrower and the
Guarantors set forth in Sections 2.14(c) (Making or Maintaining Second Priority
Term Loans), 2.15 (Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy), 2.16 (Taxes; Withholding,
etc.), 12.02 (Expenses), 12.03 (Indemnity), 12.04 (Set-Off), 12.15 (Consent to
Jurisdiction), 12.16 (Waiver of Jury Trial) and 12.17 (Confidentiality) and the
agreements of Lenders set forth in Sections 2.13 (Ratable Sharing), 8.03(b)
(General Immunity) and 8.06 (Right to Indemnity) shall survive the payment of
the Second Priority Term Loans and the termination hereof.

                                      116

<PAGE>

SECTION 12.09. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part
of any Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege
hereunder or under any other Second Priority Term Loan Document shall impair
such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right or privilege. The rights, powers and remedies given to each
Agent and each Lender hereby are cumulative and shall be in addition to and
independent of all rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any statute
or rule of law or in any of the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents. Any
forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or remedy or be
construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the further exercise of
any such right, power or remedy.

SECTION 12.10. Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither any Agent nor any Lender
shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Obligor or
any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Second Priority
Term Loan Obligations. To the extent that any Obligor makes a payment or
payments to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders (or to the Administrative
Agent, on behalf of the Lenders), or the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such
payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies
therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or
setoff had not occurred.

SECTION 12.11. Severability. In case any provision in or obligation under any
Second Priority Term Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 12.12. Second Priority Term Loan Obligations Several; Independent Nature
of Lenders' Rights. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and no
Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or Second Priority Term Loan
Commitment of any other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any
other Second Priority Term Loan Document, and no action taken by the Lenders
pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders as a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The
amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and
independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its
rights arising out hereof and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to
be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

SECTION 12.13. Headings. Section headings herein are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part hereof for any
other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

                                      117

SECTION 12.14. Applicable Law. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of
the parties hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict
of laws principles thereof.

SECTION 12.15. Consent to Jurisdiction. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST
ANY PARTY HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING HERETO OR ANY OTHER SECOND PRIORITY
TERM LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY OF THE SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN OBLIGATIONS, MAY BE
BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE,
COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
PARTY HERETO, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (A)
ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF
SUCH COURTS; (B) WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (C) AGREES THAT
SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY
REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO THE APPLICABLE
OBLIGOR AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12.01 (NOTICES); (D)
AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (C) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER
PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THE APPLICABLE OBLIGOR IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY
SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY
RESPECT; AND (E) AGREES THAT THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO
SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS
AGAINST ANY OBLIGOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

SECTION 12.16. Waiver Of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREES TO
WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
BASED UPON OR ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OF THE OTHER SECOND PRIORITY TERM
LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE LENDER/COMPANY RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING
ESTABLISHED. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY
AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF
DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS RELATED
FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS
REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER
ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY
REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 12.16 AND

                                      118

<PAGE>

EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO OR ANY OF
THE OTHER SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN OBLIGATIONS. IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY
THE COURT.

SECTION 12.17. Confidentiality.

         Each Lender shall hold all non-public information regarding the
Borrower and its business identified as such by the Borrower and obtained by
such Lender pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with such Lender's
customary procedures for handling confidential information of such nature, it
being understood and agreed by the Borrower that, in any event, a Lender may
make:

                  (i)      disclosures of such information to Affiliates of such
         Lender and to their agents and advisors (and to other Persons
         authorized by a Lender or Agent to organize, present or disseminate
         such information in connection with disclosures otherwise made in
         accordance with this Section 12.17);

                  (ii)     disclosures of such information reasonably required
         by any bona fide or potential assignee, transferee or participant in
         connection with the contemplated assignment, transfer or participation
         by such Lender of any Second Priority Term Loan Obligations or any
         participations therein;

                  (iii)    disclosure to any rating agency when required by it,
         provided that, prior to any disclosure, such rating agency shall
         undertake in writing to preserve the confidentiality of any
         confidential information relating to the Obligors received by it from
         any of the Agents or any Lender, and

                  (iv)     disclosures required or requested by any governmental
         agency or representative thereof or by the National Association of
         Insurance Commissioners or pursuant to legal or judicial process;
         provided, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court
         order, each Lender shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower
         of any request by any governmental agency or representative thereof
         (other than any such request in connection with any examination of the
         financial condition or other routine examination of such Lender by such
         governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information
         prior to disclosure of such information.

SECTION 12.18. Usury Savings Clause. Notwithstanding any other provision herein,
the aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the Second Priority
Term Loan Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith
deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate. If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the
preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful
Rate, the outstanding amount of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations shall
bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due
hereunder

                                      119

<PAGE>

equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated
rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect.
In addition, if when the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations are repaid in
full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided
for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due
hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all
times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall
pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the
amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if
the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform
strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for,
charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of
the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically
and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the
outstanding amount of the Second Priority Term Loan Obligations or be refunded
to the Borrower.

SECTION 12.19. Counterparts; Execution by Facsimile.

         (a)      This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but
all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

         (b)      The delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement
by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart hereof.

SECTION 12.20. Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective upon the
execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and receipt by
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of written or telephonic notification
of such execution and authorization of delivery thereof.

SECTION 12.21. Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion.

         Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition
or covenant provided for in this Agreement must include:

                  (i)      a statement that the Person making such certificate
         or opinion has read such covenant or condition;

                  (ii)     a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the
         examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions
         contained in such certificate or opinion are based;

                  (iii)    a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, he
         or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to
         enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not
         such covenant or condition has been satisfied; and

                  (iv)     a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of
         such Person, such condition or covenant has been satisfied.

                                      120

SECTION 12.22. No Recourse Against the Borrower or the Guarantors.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN DOCUMENT, THE SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOANS AND THE
SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN GUARANTEES ARE NON-RECOURSE SECURED OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER AND THE APPLICABLE GUARANTORS, RESPECTIVELY. THE ONLY RECOURSE A LENDER
WILL HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OF, OR INTEREST OR PREMIUM
ON, THE SECOND PRIORITY TERM LOAN OBLIGATIONS (WHETHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
PURSUANT TO THE GUARANTEES) WILL BE ENFORCEMENT OF ITS RIGHTS AGAINST THE
COLLATERAL PURSUANT TO THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

Claimants, (ii) the relevant rights and duties of the Senior Claimants with
respect to Junior Claimant on account of any Subordinated Debt as established in
this Article or (iii) the Senior Claimants' exercise of remedies in accordance
with the Senior Claim Documents.

                           [__].2.4.  Each document or instrument evidencing
Subordinated Debt shall bear a legend providing that payment of the Subordinated
Debt thereunder has been subordinated to prior payment of the Senior Claims in
the manner and to the extent set forth in this Article.

                           [__].2.5.  Junior Claimant shall not commence or join
with any other creditor or creditors of the Subordinated Debtor in commencing
any Proceeding against the Subordinated Debtor, [CalGen, CalGen Holdings or any
Guarantor--ADD ALL THAT ARE NOT SUBORDINATED DEBTORS], but may join in any
Proceeding after it has commenced. At any general meeting of creditors of
Subordinated Debtor, [CalGen, CalGen Holdings or any Guarantor--ADD ALL THAT ARE
NOT SUBORDINATED DEBTORS], or in the event of any Proceeding, if all Senior
Claims have not been paid in full in cash at such time, the Collateral Agent on
behalf of the Senior Claimants is hereby irrevocably authorized at any such
meeting or in any such Proceeding:

                           (a)        To enforce claims comprising Subordinated
                  Debt in the name of Junior Claimant, by proof of debt, proof
                  of claim, suit or otherwise;

                           (b)        To collect any assets of the Subordinated
                  Debtor distributed, divided or applied by way of dividend or
                  payment as a result of a Proceeding, or such securities
                  issued, on account of Subordinated Debt as a result thereof
                  and apply the same, or the proceeds of any realization upon
                  the same that the Senior Claimants in their discretion elect
                  to effect, to Senior Claims until all Senior Claims shall have
                  been paid in full in cash (the Senior Claimants hereby
                  agreeing to render any surplus to Junior Claimant and/or other
                  subordinated creditors, as their interests appear, or to
                  interplead such surplus with a court of competent
                  jurisdiction); and

                           (c)        To take generally any action in connection
                  with any such meeting or proceeding which Junior Claimant
                  might otherwise take in respect of the Subordinated Debt and
                  claims relating thereto.

<PAGE>

                           After the commencement of any such Proceeding, Junior
Claimant may inquire in writing of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Senior
Claimants whether the respective Senior Claimants intend to exercise the
foregoing rights with respect to the Subordinated Debt. Should the Senior
Claimants fail, at least 20 days before the deadline therefor, either to file a
proof of claim with respect to the Subordinated Debt and to furnish a copy
thereof to Junior Claimant, or to inform Junior Claimant in writing that the
Senior Claimants intend to exercise their rights to assert the Subordinated Debt
in the manner hereinabove provided, Junior Claimant may, but shall not be
required to, proceed to file a proof of claim with respect to the Subordinated
Debt and take such further steps with respect thereto, not inconsistent with
this Article, as Junior Claimant may deem proper.

                           [__].2.6.  Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an event of default under a Secured Debt Document, Junior
Claimant may, but shall have no obligation to, upon not less than 10 days prior
written notice to the Collateral Agent, purchase all of the outstanding Senior
Obligations owing to the Senior Claimants by irrevocably tendering, in
immediately available funds, full payment of the Purchase Price (as defined
below) to the Senior Claimants:

                           (a)        The Purchase Price shall be equal to the
                  total amount of Senior Claims at the time of acceleration
                  (assuming such obligations have been accelerated);

                           (b)        Any such purchase by Junior Claimant shall
                  be without warranty by, or recourse to, the Senior Claimants,
                  except with respect to the legal and beneficial ownership by
                  the Senior Claimants of the Obligations so purchased, free and
                  clear of all Liens and rights of others; and

                           (c)        Concurrently with any such purchase, the
                  Senior Claimants shall forthwith sell, assign, transfer and
                  convey to Junior Claimant all of their right, title and
                  interest in and to the Senior Obligations, and all Liens and
                  other security interests in favor of the Senior Claimants
                  securing the obligations of the Subordinated Debtor in
                  connection therewith.

                  Section [__].3.     Senior Claim Documents. The Junior
Claimant acknowledges that it has been provided with a copy of the Senior Claim
Documents and has read and is familiar with the provisions thereof.

                  Section [__].4.     Time of Filing. Notwithstanding the time
of filing, attachment or recording of any document or other instrument, it is
agreed by Junior Claimant that any Liens arising under or pursuant to the Senior
Claim Documents shall be senior to any Liens arising in favor of Junior Claimant
as part of or relating to the Subordinated Debt Documents, if any; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit Junior Claimant to obtain
any such Liens.

                  Section [__].5.     Wrongful Collections. Should any payment
on account of, or any collateral for any part of, the Subordinated Debt be
received by Junior Claimant in violation of this Article, such payment or
collateral shall be delivered forthwith to the Collateral Agent by

                                       A-4
<PAGE>

the recipient for application to Senior Claims, in the form received. The
Collateral Agent is irrevocably authorized to supply any required endorsement or
assignment which may have been omitted. Until so delivered, any such payment or
collateral shall be held by the recipient in trust for the Senior Claimants and
shall not be commingled with other funds or property of the recipient.

                  Section [__].6.     Ownership of Subordinated Debt; Amendment
of Subordinated Debt Documents.

                           [__].6.1.  The Junior Claimant represents and
warrants that it is the lawful owner of the Subordinated Debt. Any security
interest in the Junior Claimant's interest in the Subordinated Debt will at all
times be subject to the rights of the Senior Claimants hereunder. The Junior
Claimant agrees that it may not assign all or any portion of the Subordinated
Debt or any of its rights or remedies under the Subordinated Debt Documents
unless any assignee expressly agrees in writing for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent that it takes such Subordinated Debt subject in all respects to
the rights of the Senior Claimants hereunder.

                           [__].6.2.  The Subordinated Debt Documents may not be
amended so as to have an adverse effect upon the Senior Claims or the
Subordinated Debtor's ability to pay the Senior Claims at any time.

                  Section [__].7.     Waivers. The Collateral Agent and the
Senior Claimants are hereby authorized to demand specific performance of this
Article, whether or not the Subordinated Debtor shall have complied with the
provisions hereof applicable to it, at any time when Junior Claimant shall have
failed to comply with any provision hereof applicable to it. Junior Claimant
hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law
which might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance hereof in
any action brought therefor by the Senior Claimants. Junior Claimant (a) further
waives presentment, notice and protest in connection with all negotiable
instruments evidencing Senior Claims or Subordinated Debt to which Junior
Claimant may be a party, notice of the acceptance of this Article by the Senior
Claimants, notice of any loan made, extension granted or other action taken in
reliance hereon, and all demands and notices of every kind in connection with
this Article, Senior Claims or time of payment of Senior Claims or Subordinated
Debt and (b) hereby assents to any renewal, extension or postponement of the
time of payment of Senior Claims or any other indulgence with respect thereto,
to any increase in the amount of Senior Claims, to any substitution, exchange or
release of collateral therefor and to the addition or release of any person
primarily or secondarily liable thereon and assents to the provisions of any
instrument, security or other writing evidencing Senior Claims.

                  Section [__].8.     Subrogation; No Impairment of Subordinated
Debtor's Obligations. Subject to and from and after the Senior Obligations
Termination Date, Junior Claimant shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Senior Claimants to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or
securities of the Subordinated Debtor applicable to the Senior Claims until all
amounts owing on the Subordinated Debt shall be paid in full. For purposes of
such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the Senior Claimants to which
Junior Claimant would be entitled but for the provisions of this Article, and no
payments paid over by Junior

                                       A-5
<PAGE>

Claimant to Senior Claimants pursuant to this Article shall, as among the
Subordinated Debtor, its creditors other than the Senior Claimants, and Junior
Claimant, be deemed to be a payment or distribution on account of the
Subordinated Debt, it being understood that the provisions of this Article are
intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of Junior
Claimant and the Senior Claimants. Nothing contained in this Article is intended
to or shall impair, as between the Subordinated Debtor and Junior Claimant, the
obligation of the Subordinated Debtor, which is absolute and unconditional, to
pay to Junior Claimant the principal of and the premium, if any, and the
interest on the Subordinated Debt, and all other amounts payable by the
Subordinated Debtor under the Subordinated Debt Documents, as and when the same
shall become due and payable, or to affect the relative rights of Junior
Claimant and creditors of Subordinated Debtor other than the Senior Claimants.

                  Section [__].9.     Reinstatement. The obligations of Junior
Claimant under this Article shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as
the case may be, if at any time any payment in respect of any Senior Claim, or
any other payment to any holder of any Senior Claim in its capacity as such, is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the holder of such Senior
Claims upon the occurrence of any Proceeding, or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, the Subordinated Debtor or any substantial part of its property, or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

                  Section [__].10.    Bankruptcy. This Article shall remain in
full force and effect as between Junior Claimant and the Senior Claimants
notwithstanding the occurrence of any Proceeding affecting the Subordinated
Debtor.

                  Section [__].11.    Further Assurances. The Subordinated
Debtor and Junior Claimant shall execute and deliver to the Senior Claimants
such further instruments and shall take such further action as the Senior
Claimants may at any time or times reasonably request in order to carry out the
provisions and intent of this Article.

                  Section [__].12.    Successors and Assigns. The provisions of
this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Neither Junior Claimant nor
the Senior Claimants shall have a duty to preserve rights against prior parties
in any property of any kind received hereunder. Nothing contained herein shall
impose on the Senior Claimants any duties with respect to any property of the
Subordinated Debtor or Junior Claimant received hereunder.

                  Section [__].13.    Governing Law. This Article is intended to
take effect as a sealed instrument, shall be binding upon the parties hereto and
their respective executors, administrators, other legal representatives,
successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Senior Claimants,
their respective successors and assigns and shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York without reference to principles of conflict of laws (other
than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law). The parties hereto
intend and agree that this Article shall remain binding on such parties (other
than the Subordinated Debtor) notwithstanding the termination (except upon the
payment in full of Senior Claims in cash) or unenforceability of this Article as
against the Subordinated Debtor.

Re:      Calpine Generating Company, LLC - Assignment Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Reference is made to the Credit and Guarantee Agreement, dated as of

Generating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Borrower"),
the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time
party thereto, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent
(with its successors and permitted assigns in such capacity, the "Administrative
Agent") and each of the other agents and arrangers listed on the signature pages
thereto. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Second Priority
Term Loan Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the
Second Priority Term Loan Agreement.

         As of [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASSIGNMENT] (the "Effective Date"),
[INSERT NAME OF ASSIGNOR] (the "Assignor") irrevocably sells, transfers, conveys
and assigns, without recourse, representation or warranty (except as expressly
set forth herein), to [INSERT NAME OF ASSIGNEE] (the "Assignee"), and the
Assignee irrevocably purchases from the Assignor and assumes (as more

PRIORITY TERM LOANS TO BE ASSIGNED]) and (b) all rights, benefits, obligations,
liabilities, and indemnities related to such Second Priority Term Loans under
and in connection with the Second Priority Term Loan Agreement and the other

<PAGE>

         In addition, this Assignment Agreement constitutes notice to the
Administrative Agent, pursuant to Section 12.06 of the Second Priority Term Loan
Agreement, of the assignment and delegation to the Assignee of the Assigned
Portion of the Second Priority Term Loans of the Assignor outstanding under the
Second Priority Term Loan Agreement as of the Effective Date, subject to its
written consents.

         All accrued and unpaid interest, fees and other amounts payable with
respect to the Assigned Portion for any period of time prior to the Effective
Date shall be payable to the Assignor, and all accrued and unpaid interest, fees
and other amounts payable with respect to the Assigned Portion for any period
from and after the Effective Date shall be payable to the Assignee. The Assignor
and Assignee each agree to hold in trust for the other any such amounts that it
receives pursuant to any Second Priority Term Loan Document and to which the
other party is entitled.

         The Assignee confirms and agrees that in becoming a Lender and in
making its Second Priority Term Loans under the Second Priority Term Loan
Agreement, such actions have and will be made without recourse to, or
representation or warranty by, the Administrative Agent, except for the
representations expressly set forth below.

         The Assignor represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to
enter into and deliver this Assignment Agreement, that its existing aggregate
Second Priority Term Loans are as set forth on Schedule I hereto, that it is the
legal and beneficial owner of the Assigned Portion and that it has not created
any adverse claim on its interest in the Assigned Portion. Except as set forth
in the previous sentence, the Assignor makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made pursuant to or in connection with this Assignment
Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Assignment Agreement, the Second Priority Term Loan
Agreement, any other Second Priority Term Loan Document or any other instrument
or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, including the financial
condition of any CalGen Company or the performance or observance by any Lender
or any of the Agents of any of its obligations under the Second Priority Term
Loan Agreement, any other Second Priority Term Loan Document or any other

         The Assignee (a) represents and warrants that (i) it is an Eligible
Assignee and that it is legally authorized to enter into and deliver this
Assignment Agreement, (ii) it has experience and expertise in the making of or
investing in loans such as the applicable Second Priority Term Loans and (iii)

Exchange Act or other federal securities laws, (b) confirms that it has received
a copy of the Second Priority Term Loan Agreement, together with copies of the

it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations

                                       B-2

which by the terms of the Second Priority Term Loan Agreement and the other
Second Priority Term Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a
Lender, (d) acknowledges that it has received copies of, consented to and
approved the Collateral Trust Agreement, and authorizes the Agents to perform
their respective obligations thereunder and (e) attaches the forms prescribed by
applicable Governmental Authorities as to the Assignee's status for purposes of
determining exemption from withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be
made to the Assignee under any of the Second Priority Term Loan Documents or
such other documents as are necessary to indicate that all such payments are
subject to such rates at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty. In
addition, the Assignee, independently and without reliance upon the Assignor,
the Administrative Agent, any other Agent or any other Lender, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, shall
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
the Second Priority Term Loan Agreement, the other Second Priority Term Loan
Documents and the other instruments and documents delivered in connection
therewith. ASSIGNEE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ITS LIEN PRIORITIES, THE

         Following the execution of this Assignment Agreement, it will be

request by the Assignee, will request that the Administrative Agent exchange the
attached Second Priority Term Loan Note for a new Second Priority Term Loan
Note, payable to the Assignee and (ii) if the Assignor has retained any
interest, may request that the Administrative Agent exchange the attached Second
Priority Term Loan Note for a new Second Priority Term Loan Note, payable to the
Assignor, and in each case in amounts which reflect the assignment being made
hereby and after giving effect to any other assignments which have become
effective on the Effective Date.

         Except as otherwise provided in the Second Priority Term Loan
Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date:

                  (a)      the Assignee:

         Agreement and the other Second Priority Term Loan Documents to the
         extent specified in the second paragraph of this Assignment Agreement,

                                   LITIGATION

         We are party from time to time to various litigation matters arising in
the normal course of business. On July 22, 2003, PG&E filed with CPUC a
complaint and request for immediate issuance of an order to show cause against
Calpine, CPN Pipeline Company, CES, Calpine Natural Gas Company and LGS. The
complaint requests that CPUC issue an order requiring the defendants to (i) show
cause why they should not be ordered to cease and desist from using any direct
interconnections between the facilities of CPN Pipeline Company and those of
LGS, unless such parties first seek and obtain regulatory approval from CPUC,
and (ii) pay to PG&E any underpayments of PG&E's tariffed transportation rates
and to make restitution for any profits earned from any business activity
related to LGS' direct interconnections to any entity other than PG&E. The
complaint also seeks an order permanently enjoining LGS and any entity other
than PG&E from entering into or utilizing direct interconnections with LGS, and
directing defendants to pay to PG&E any underpayments of PG&E's tariffed
transportation rates and to make restitution for any profits earned from any
business activity related to LGS' direct interconnections to any entity other
than PG&E. The complaint also alleges that various natural gas consumers,
including Calpine-affiliated generation facilities within California, are
engaged with defendants in the acts complained of, and that the defendants
unlawfully bypass PG&E's system and operate as an unregulated local distribution
company within PG&E's service territory. On August 27, 2003, Calpine filed its
answer and a motion to dismiss, which was denied on October 16, 2003.

         On January 15, 2004, PG&E, the Calpine entities and LGS entered into
the Settlement which would resolve all issues raised by the complaint. Although
the Settlement became effective as of January 15, 2004, certain of its terms
will only become effective upon approval of the Settlement by CPUC, and in the
event that CPUC does not approve the Settlement certain of its provisions will
become null and void. Upon approval of the Settlement by CPUC, PG&E would be
paid $2.7 million and the parties would release all claims relating to prior
periods. PG&E also would agree not to pursue any new claim of unauthorized
public utility activity against the Calpine entities named in the complaint,
except insofar as such new claim raises matters not raised in the complaint, or
with respect to a change in the facts and circumstances relating to alleged
unauthorized public utility activity from those facts and circumstances existing
as of January 15, 2004. As provided by the Settlement. the direct
interconnections between CPN Pipeline and LGS have been shut down pending
possible future regulatory action.

         In accordance with the procedural schedule adopted by the presiding
administrative law judge, a settlement meeting was conducted pursuant to CPUC
settlement procedures on January 26, 2004. The settling parties filed a motion
for approval of the Settlement on February 6. Comments on the Settlement were
due March 8, and no party filed comments opposing any provision of the
settlement agreement. Reply comments are due March 23.

                                 Schedule 4.11-1
<PAGE>

         The complaint does not name us or our facilities as defendants.
However, if the Settlement is not approved, there can be no assurances that this
litigation will not adversely affect CPN Pipeline Company's ability to perform
its obligations under the Cotenancy, Operating and Maintenance Agreement among
CPN Pipeline Company, Gilroy Energy Center, LLC, the Delta facility and the Los
Medanos facility.

         On June 11, 2003, the Estate of Darrell Jones and the Estate of Cynthia
Jones filed a complaint against Calpine in the U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington. Calpine purchased Goldendale Energy, Inc., a Washington
corporation, from Darrell Jones. The agreement provided, among other things,
that upon substantial completion of the Goldendale facility, Calpine would pay
Mr. Jones (i) $6.0 million and (ii) $18.0 million less $0.2 million per day for
each day that elapsed between July 1, 2002 and the date of substantial
completion. Substantial completion of the Goldendale facility has not occurred
and the daily reduction in the payment amount has reduced the $18.0 million
payment to zero. The complaint alleges that by not achieving substantial
completion by July 1, 2002, Calpine breached its contract with Mr. Jones,
violated a duty of good faith and fair dealing, and caused an inequitable
forfeiture. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount in excess of
$75,000. On July 28, 2003, Calpine filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court granted
Calpine's motion to dismiss the complaint on March 10, 2004. The plaintiffs may
appeal, and could also seek reconsideration of the decision.

         The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined,
nor can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in
each case presently be reasonably estimated.
