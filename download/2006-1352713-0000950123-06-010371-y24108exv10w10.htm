<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Award Agreement and the Options granted hereby shall be subject to the Plan, the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference, and in the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between the Plan and this Award Agreement, the Plan shall govern. Capitalized terms used herein
without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan, a copy of which has been
furnished to the Optionee.

the Date of Grant, the Option to purchase the number of Shares specified above at the Exercise
Price. The Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option are from time to time referred to herein as
the &#147;Option Shares.&#148; The grant of an Option shall impose no obligation on the part of the Optionee
to exercise the Option. The Option shall vest as specified above in the Notice of Share Option
Grant and be exercisable as hereinafter provided.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option is granted subject to the following terms and conditions:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(a)&nbsp;Vesting; Exercisability</B>. The Option shall vest and become exercisable in
accordance with the vesting schedule set forth above in the Notice of Share Option Grant,
which vesting schedule shall be no less favorable to the Optionee than that set forth in any
applicable vesting schedule set forth in any employment, management retention, change in
control, severance or similar agreement between the Optionee and RAM or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates, unless the Option has earlier vested or been forfeited in
accordance with the terms hereof.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;Term of the Option. </B>The Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable on the
earlier of (i)&nbsp;the seventh anniversary of the Date of Grant or (ii)&nbsp;the date specified for
termination of the Option in Sections&nbsp;4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) below; provided, however, if the
termination date falls on a date which the Optionee is prohibited by RAM&#146;s policy in effect
on such date from engaging in transactions in RAM&#146;s securities, such termination date shall
be extended to ten business days following the first date that the Optionee has been advised
that the Optionee is permitted to engage in transactions in RAM&#146;s securities under such RAM
policy.

may exercise all or any portion of the Option (to the extent vested) by giving notice of
exercise to RAM or RAM&#146;s agent, provided, however, that no less than 10 Option Shares may be
purchased upon any exercise of the Option unless the number of Option Shares purchased at
such time is the total number of Option Shares in respect of which the Option is then
exercisable, and provided, further, that in no event shall the Option be exercisable for a
fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (i)&nbsp;the date on

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Agreement, the Optionee may not exercise
the Option, whether in whole or in part, and no Option Shares will be issued by RAM in
respect of any such attempted exercise, at any time when such exercise is prohibited by RAM
policy then in effect concerning transactions by the Optionee in RAM&#146;s securities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(d)&nbsp;Payment. </B>Prior to the issuance of a certificate pursuant to Section 3(g) hereof
evidencing the Option Shares in respect of which all or a portion of the Option shall have
been exercised, the Optionee shall have paid to RAM the Exercise Price for all Option Shares
purchased pursuant to the exercise of such Option. Payment may be made by personal check,
bank draft or postal or express money order (such modes of payment are collectively referred
to as &#147;cash&#148;) payable to the order of RAM in U.S. dollars. Payment may also be made in
Common Shares owned by the Optionee, or in any combination of cash or such shares as the
Committee in its sole discretion may approve. Such shares shall be valued at their Fair
Market Value as of the date of exercise. Payment of the Exercise Price in Common Shares
owned by the Optionee shall be made by delivering to RAM the share certificate(s)
representing the required number of shares, with the Optionee signing his or her name on the
back, or by attaching executed share powers/share transfer forms (with the signature of the
Optionee authenticated in either case); payment of the Exercise Price in Common Shares owned
by the Optionee may also be made through constructive surrender, by submission of an
attestation of ownership in the form approved by RAM and with such signatures or other
guarantees as may be required by RAM. In the discretion of the Committee, and in accordance
with rules and procedures established by the Committee (or by any person to whom authority
to establish such rules and procedures shall have been delegated by the Committee), the
Optionee shall be permitted to make a &#147;cashless&#148; exercise of all or a portion of the Option.
Common Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of a Share Option shall, subject to the terms
hereof, be purchased for consideration, paid for at such times, by such methods, and in such
forms, including cash, share repurchase, option cancellation, Optionee services or other
consideration, as the Committee shall determine.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(e)&nbsp;Shareholder Rights. </B>The Optionee shall have no rights as a shareholder with
respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option until the Optionee shall become
the holder of record thereof, and no adjustment shall be made for dividends or distributions
or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon
which the Optionee shall become the holder of record thereof.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(f)&nbsp;Limitation on Exercise. </B>The Option shall not be exercisable unless the offer and
sale of Common Shares pursuant thereto has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the &#147;1933 Act&#148;), and qualified under applicable state &#147;blue sky&#148; laws or RAM has
determined that an exemption from registration under the 1933 Act and from qualification
under such state &#147;blue sky&#148; laws is available.

practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and payment of the Exercise
Price for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised,

portion of the Option Gain (as defined herein) that the Optionee realizes from any full or

within one year following such termination of the Optionee&#146;s employment. An Optionee will
be considered to engage in &#147;Competitive Activity&#148; if the Optionee (1)&nbsp;enters into a
relationship as an employee, officer, partner, member, director, independent contractor,
consultant, advisor or agent of, or in any similar relationship with, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other business entity that engages
in a financial guaranty reinsurance business, whether existing or to be formed, without

Gain&#148; realized upon full or partial exercise of an Option is the amount of income that would
be reportable on the Optionee&#146;s Form W-2 (or successor form) if RAM issued such a form to
the Optionee, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion for the year in which
such exercise occurs. RAM may require the Optionee, in connection with any full or partial
exercise of an Option, to certify in a manner acceptable to RAM that the Optionee has not
engaged in Competitive Activity and may decline to give effect to such exercise if the
Optionee fails so to certify. If the Optionee is required to repay any Option Gain to RAM
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4(g), the Optionee shall pay such amount in such manner and on such
terms and conditions as RAM may require, and RAM shall be entitled to withhold or set-off
against any other amount owed to the Optionee by RAM or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
any amount owed to the Optionee under any retirement plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code) up to any amount sufficient to satisfy any unpaid obligation of

establish from time to time. RAM shall also have the right to deduct from all cash payments made
