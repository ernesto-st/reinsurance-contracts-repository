receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                  (b)      Automatic Borrowing. No Borrowing Request and no
notice under Section 2.04(c) shall be required to be presented by Borrower to

due or (ii) if no Default then exists, collected funds in the Cash Concentration
Account (as defined in the Security Agreement) are required to be deposited in
the Collateral Proceeds Account (as defined in the Security Agreement) and are
not required to be transferred to the General Funds Account and a check, checks
or other debit shall be presented for payment against the Disbursement Account
on a Business Day when funds are not otherwise available therein to honor such
debits. In either such event, the Administrative Agent shall without Borrower's
or any Lender's consent, promptly advise the Swingline Lender of the amount of
Swingline Loans (or if sufficient Swingline Loan availability does not exist,
promptly advise the Lenders of the amount of Revolving Loans), in each case as
is necessary (i) to be credited to the Disbursement Account on such day to
permit such debits to be honored provided no Default exists or (ii) to pay the
amount of such Obligation. Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.03(b) will be
made available to the Administrative Agent and the amounts so received by the
Administrative Agent, shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, be made available to the Borrower by crediting the same to the
Disbursement Account or by utilizing the same to pay the Obligation then due, as
applicable. Loans made under this Section 2.03(b) shall be made as ABR Loans.

         Section 2.04.     Swingline Loans.

                  (a)      Swingline Advances. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make advances to the
Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $25,000,000,
(ii) the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the total Commitments or (iii) the
sum of the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the Borrowing Base then in
effect; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing
limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower
may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                  (b)      Permitted Overadvance. The Swingline Lender may
extend Swingline Loans even if after giving effect thereto the Revolving
Exposures exceed the Borrowing Base (each such Swingline Loan herein an
"Overadvance Loan") if it determines to do so in its discretion (the Swingline
Lender however having no obligation to do so) and the following conditions are
satisfied as of the date when the Overadvance Loan is made: (A) the aggregate
amount by which the Revolving Exposures exceed the Borrowing Base does not at
any time exceed five percent (5%) of the total amount of the Commitments of all
Lenders (such aggregate amount, herein the "Overadvance"); (B) the Revolving
Exposure shall at no time exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments; (C)
the Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the Borrowing Base for more than
forty-five (45) consecutive days; (D) no other Overadvance Loan had been made
within the last one hundred and eighty days (180); and (E) the applicable
Overadvance results from the payment by the Swingline Lender of any amounts
required to maintain, protect or realize upon the Collateral or to prevent a
cessation of business by the Borrower or

                                       25
<PAGE>

any of the Subsidiaries. The fact that the Swingline Lender may make an
Overadvance Loan or an Overadvance may exist, shall not constitute a waiver of
any Default nor of the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders under this Agreement arising as a result thereof or otherwise. The
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, may at any time require the
Borrower's strict compliance with this Agreement, including without limitation,
the provisions of Section 2.10(b). The terms of this Section 2.04(b) are
provided to facilitate the administration of the facility contemplated hereby as
among the Lenders. This Section 2.04(b) shall not give the Borrower any
substantive rights against the Swingline Lender or any other Lender and is for
the sole benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders when it is aware that an Overadvance exists.

                  (c)      Swingline Loan Request. To request a Swingline Loan,
the Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender of such request by telephone

shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of
the requested Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline
Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit
account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a
Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the relevant Issuing Bank) by 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

                  (d)      Lender Participation. On the date a Swingline Loan is
made by the Swingline Lender (including, without limitation, any Swingline Loan
that is an Overadvance Loan made in accordance with clause (b) immediately
above), the Swingline Lender shall be deemed without further action by any party
hereto, to have sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without
further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from the Swingline Lender
a risk participation to the extent of such Lender's Applicable Percentage in the
Swingline Loan so made, such participation to be funded in accordance with
clause (e) of this Section 2.04.

                  (e)      Repayment of Swingline Loans; Funding of
Participation. The Borrower promises to pay to the order of the Swingline Lender
for its own account the outstanding principal amount of each Swingline Loan on
the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date, (ii) the date which is seven (7) days
after the Swingline Loan is made or (iii) the date after a Swingline Loan is
made when any other Loan is made pursuant to a formal Borrowing Request under
Section 2.03 (the earlier of such date with respect to a Swingline Loan herein
the "Swingline Maturity"). Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Borrower may repay a Swingline Loan on its Swingline Maturity under
clause (ii) above or at any time prior thereto by requesting another Loan in
accordance with the terms hereof and with the proceeds of such other Loan
payable to the Swingline Lender for its own account. The Swingline Lender, at
any time in its sole and absolute discretion and whether or not a Swingline
Maturity shall have occurred, may require that each Lender fund its
participation in the then outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans
(including, without limitation, any Swingline Loan made as an Overadvance Loan
in accordance with Section 2.04(b)) by giving each Lender notice thereof.
Additionally, if the Borrower shall not have repaid a Swingline Loan by 1:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the corresponding Swingline Maturity, the Swingline
Lender will notify each Lender of the aggregate principal amount of the
Swingline Loan which has not been repaid. Upon the giving of any notice by the
Swingline Lender under either of the preceding two sentences, each Lender shall
comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to
Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to
the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Lenders. Amounts funded by a Lender under this Section 2.04(e) shall be
Revolving Loans and ABR Loans.

                  (f)      Participation Obligations Absolute; Failure to Fund
Participation. The obligations of a Lender to fund its participation in the
Swingline Loans in accordance with the terms hereof shall be absolute,
unconditional, and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of the Loan Documents under all circumstances whatsoever,
including without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) any lack of
validity of any Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any Default; (iii) the
existence of any claim, set-off, counterclaim, defenses, or other rights which
such Lender, any Loan Party, or any other Person may have; (iv) the occurrence
of any event that has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; (v) the failure of any condition to a Loan under Article IV to be
satisfied; (vi) the fact that after giving effect to the funding of the
participation the Revolving Exposure may exceed the Borrowing Base; (vii) the
fact that the Swingline Loan is an Overadvance Loan made in accordance with
Section 2.04(b); or (viii) any other circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing. If a Lender fails to fund its participation in
a Swingline Loan as required hereby, such Lender shall remain obligated to pay
to the Swingline Lender the amount it failed to fund on demand together with
interest thereon in respect of the period commencing on the date such amount
should have been funded until the date the amount was actually funded at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such period and the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset against any and all sums to be
paid to such Lender hereunder the amount due under this sentence. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any
Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in
respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not
to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the
Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline
Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of
participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent;
any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted
by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments
pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may
appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this
paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
The foregoing provisions of this clause (f) shall not be construed to excuse the
Swingline Lender from liability to the Lenders to the extent of any direct
damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are
hereby waived by the Lenders to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered
by the Lenders that are caused by such Swingline Lender's failure to exercise
care when determining whether to make a Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender and
the Lenders expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Swingline Lender (as finally determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction), the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to have
exercised care in each such determination.

         Section 2.05.     Letters of Credit.

                  (a)      General. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of letters of credit for its
own account or the account of one of its Subsidiaries, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Bank, at any
time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement
submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing
Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

                  (b)      Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant
Issuing Bank) to the relevant Issuing Bank (if different than the Administrative
Agent) and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date
of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance
of a Letter

                                       27
<PAGE>

of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
(which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to
expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of
such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such
other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such
Letter of Credit. If requested by the relevant Issuing Bank, the Borrower also
shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form
in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall
be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension, (i) the aggregate face amount of all outstanding Letters
of Credit shall not exceed $30,000,000, (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall
not exceed the total Commitments and (iii) the sum of the total Revolving
Exposures shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect.

                  (c)      Expiration Date; Collateralization of Extended Term
Letters of Credit. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close
of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the
issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension
thereof, one year after such renewal or extension); provided this clause shall
not prohibit the issuance of a Letter of Credit that by its terms may be
automatically extended (unless an Issuing Bank elects not to extend) for
successive one-year periods (which in no event shall extend beyond the date
referred to in the following clause (ii)) or (ii) the one year anniversary of
the Maturity Date; provided, however, that with respect to each Letter of Credit
with an expiry date beyond the Maturity Date, the Borrower shall pledge cash
collateral pursuant to Section 2.05(j) in an amount not less than 102.5% of the
face value of such Letter of Credit on or before the date 60 days prior to the
Maturity Date.

                  (d)      Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank or the
Lenders, an Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby
acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this
Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower
for any reason. The obligations of a Lender to fund its participation in a
Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms hereof shall be absolute,
unconditional, and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of the Loan Documents under all circumstances whatsoever,
including without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) any lack of
validity of any Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any Default; (iii) the
existence of any claim, set-off, counterclaim, defenses, or other rights which
such Lender, any Loan Party, or any other Person may have; (iv) the occurrence
of any event that has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; (v) the failure of any condition to a Loan under Article IV to be
satisfied; (vi) the fact that after giving effect to the funding of the
participation the Revolving Exposure may exceed the Borrowing Base; or (vii) any
other circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
If a Lender fails to fund its participation in a Letter of Credit as required
hereby, such Lender shall, subject to the foregoing proviso, remain obligated to
pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amount it failed to fund on demand
together with interest thereon in respect of the period commencing on the date
such amount should have been funded until the date the amount was actually
funded at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such
period and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset against any and
all sums to be paid to such Lender hereunder the amount due under this sentence.
Any amounts received by an Issuing Bank from the Borrower (or other party on
behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a LC Disbursement after receipt by the
Issuing Bank of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to

                                       28
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent
shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall
have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Issuing Bank, as
their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Letter of Credit
pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the
payment of any reimbursement obligations in respect of any LC Disbursement. The
foregoing provisions of this clause (d) shall not be construed to excuse the
relevant Issuing Bank from liability to the Lenders to the extent of any direct
damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are
hereby waived by the Lenders to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered
by the Lenders that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care
when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The Issuing Banks and the Lenders
expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct
on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised
care in each such determination.

                  (e)      Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such
LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that
the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the day of the receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than the applicable minimum Borrowing amount
set forth in Section 2.02(c), the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to
borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that
such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to
make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when
due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such
Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such
notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the
amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to such
Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than
the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above)
shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation
to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (f)      Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit

                                       29
<PAGE>

against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the
terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. The
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank, or any of their Related
Parties, shall not have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
relevant Issuing Bank. The foregoing provisions of this clause (f) shall not be
construed to excuse the relevant Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The Issuing
Banks and the Borrower expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence
or willful misconduct on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the relevant
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

                  (g)      Disbursement Procedures. The relevant Issuing Bank
shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting
to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such relevant
Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that
any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the
Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.

                  (h)      Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any
LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof
shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such
LC Disbursement, at a rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant
to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest
accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the relevant
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse an Issuing
Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (i)      Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may
be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights

                                       30
<PAGE>

and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                  (j)      Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of
cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an
account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent
and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC
Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective
immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without
demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. The
Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to
the extent required by: (i) Section 2.05(c) and (ii) Section 2.10(b), and any
such cash collateral so deposited under Section 2.05(c) or 2.10(b) and held by
the Administrative Agent hereunder shall constitute part of the Borrowing Base
for purposes of determining compliance with this Agreement. Each such deposit
shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and
performance of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive
dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such
account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,
which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent but for the Borrower's account and at the Borrower's risk
and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any,
on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse an Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Lenders), be
applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been
cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.05(c) with respect to a Letter of
Credit, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be promptly
returned to the Borrower when the Letter of Credit has expired if no Default
then exists. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be promptly returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that,
after giving effect to such return, the Borrower would remain in compliance with
Section 2.10(b) and no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

         Section 2.06.     Funding of Borrowings.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it
hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative
Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly
(but in no event later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time) crediting the amounts
so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the
Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Loans made: (i)
to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
2.05(e) shall be remitted by the

                                       31
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank and (ii) under Section
2.03(b) shall be used by the Administrative Agent to pay the Obligations and
other amounts then due.

                  (b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share
of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made
its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent,
then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or
(ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If
such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

         Section 2.07.     Interest Elections.

                  (a)      Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the
Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a LIBOR
Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing
Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a
different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBOR
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.
The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of
the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated
ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the
Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted
or continued.

                  (b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by
the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the
Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to
be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

                  (c)      Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                           (i)      the Borrowing to which such Interest
Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with
respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant
to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
Borrowing);

                           (ii)     the effective date of the election made
pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                           (iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an
ABR Borrowing or a LIBOR Borrowing; and

                                       32
<PAGE>

                           (iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a LIBOR
Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Borrowing but does not
specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e)      If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
LIBOR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

         Section 2.08.     Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments.

                  (a)      Termination on Maturity Date. Unless previously
terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

                  (b)      Optional Termination or Reduction; Commitment
Reduction Fee. The Borrower may at any time terminate or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
than $1,000,000; (ii) the Commitments may not be reduced below an aggregate
amount equal to $50,000,000 unless terminated in their entirety; and (iii) the
Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect
to any concurrent prepayment of Loans in accordance with this Agreement, the sum
of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Commitments. If the Borrower
terminates or reduces the Commitments either in whole or in part prior to the
second anniversary of the Effective Date, for any reason other than refinancing
of the Loans with JPMorgan Chase Bank or any of its Affiliates and other than as
set forth in Section 2.08(d) below, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, on the date of such termination
or reduction, as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of making
funds available to the Borrower under this Agreement, and not as a penalty, an
amount equal to: (i) if the Commitments are reduced or terminated prior to or on
the first anniversary of the Effective Date, 0.50% of the amount of the
Commitments so reduced or terminated and (b) if the Commitments are reduced or
terminated after the first anniversary of the Effective Date but prior to or on
the second anniversary of the Effective Date, 0.25% of the amount of the
Commitments so reduced or terminated.

                  (c)      Notice of Commitment Reduction or Termination. The
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or
reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three
Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction,
specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following
receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments
delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any

                                       33
<PAGE>

termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Except as
provided in paragraph (d) below, each reduction of the Commitments shall be made
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

                  (d)      Termination of Non-Consenting Lender. In the event
the Borrower is entitled to replace a non-consenting Lender pursuant to Section
9.02(c), the Borrower shall have the right, upon five Business Days' written
notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), to terminate the entire Commitment of
such Lender, so long as (i) all Loans, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Lender are repaid pursuant to
Section 2.10(d) concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination and (ii)
the consents required by Section 9.02(c) in connection with the prepayment shall
have been obtained, and at such time, such Lender shall no longer constitute a
"Lender" for purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 (other than Section 9.03(c)) of this Agreement, which shall
survive as to such Lender.

                  (e)      Increase of Commitments. By written notice sent to
the Administrative Agent (which the Administrative Agent shall promptly
distribute to the Lenders), the Borrower may request an increase of the
aggregate amount of the Commitments: (i) by an aggregate amount equal to any
integral multiple of $10,000,000 and (ii) by an aggregate amount not to exceed
$50,000,000; provided that (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and (B) the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall not previously
have been increased more than once pursuant to this Section 2.08(e). Upon notice
to the Administrative Agent of the Borrower's election to exercise its option to
increase the Commitments under this Section 2.08(e), the Administrative Agent
shall endeavor to arrange, on a best efforts basis, and syndicate the proposed
increase in the Commitments to the Lenders or other financial institutions which
are acceptable to the Administrative Agent and consented to by the Borrower
(with the Borrower's consent not to be unreasonably withheld). The Borrower
agrees to assist the Administrative Agent in whatever reasonable manner is
necessary to successfully accomplish such syndication. Each Lender, in its sole
and absolute discretion, shall determine whether it will increase its
Commitment. If the Lenders increasing their respective Commitments are unable to
increase the Commitments by the full amount of the request, then, with notice to
the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders, another one or more financial
institutions, each as approved by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a
"New Lender"), may commit to provide an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
the requested increase that is not to be provided by the existing Lenders (the
"Increase Amount"); provided, that the Commitment of each New Lender shall be at
least $10,000,000. Upon receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent to the
Lenders and the Borrower that the Lenders, or sufficient Lenders and New
Lenders, have agreed to commit to an aggregate amount equal to the requested
increase (or such lesser amount as the Borrower shall agree, which shall be at
least $10,000,000 and an integral multiple of $10,000,000 in excess thereof),
then: provided that no Event of Default exists at such time or after giving
effect to the requested increase, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders willing to increase their respective Commitments and the New Lenders (if
any) shall execute and deliver an Increased Commitment Supplement (herein so
called) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E. If all existing Lenders shall
not have provided their pro rata portion of the requested increase, then after
giving effect to the requested increase the outstanding Loans may not be held
pro rata in accordance with the new Commitments. In order to remedy the
foregoing, on the effective date of the Increased Commitment Supplement, the
Lenders shall make advances among themselves so that after giving effect thereto
the Loans (which are not Swingline Loans) will be held by the Lenders, pro rata
in accordance with the Applicable Percentage hereunder. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 9.04, the advances so made by each Lender whose Applicable
Percentage has increased shall be deemed to be a purchase of a corresponding
amount of the Loans of the Lender or Lenders whose Applicable Percentage have
decreased. The Commitments of the Lenders who do not agree to increase their
Commitments cannot be reduced or otherwise changed pursuant to this Section
2.08(e).

         Section 2.09.     Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

                  (a)      The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date.
Swingline Loans shall be repaid as provided in Section 2.04.

                  (b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including
the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time
to time hereunder.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in
which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant
to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e)      Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

         Section 2.10.     Prepayment of Loans.

                  (a)      Optional Prepayment. The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to the requirements of this Section and Section 2.15.

                  (b)      Overadvance Prepayment. In the event and on each
occasion that the total Revolving Exposures exceeds the Borrowing Base then in
effect, the Borrower shall prepay Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no
such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, if
at any time the Borrower is required to make a prepayment under this paragraph
the Borrower would incur breakage costs under Section 2.15 as a result of LIBOR
Loans being prepaid other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto (the "Affected LIBOR Loans"), and provided that no Default has occurred
and is continuing at the time, then the Borrower may in its sole discretion
initially deposit a portion (up to 100%) of the amounts that otherwise would
have been paid in respect of the Affected LIBOR Loans with the Administrative
Agent (which deposit must be equal in amount to the amount of the Affected LIBOR
Loans not immediately prepaid) to be held as security for the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and shall
provide for investments in Permitted Investments satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and

                                       35
<PAGE>

the Borrower, with such cash collateral to be directly applied upon the first
occurrence (or occurrences) thereafter of the last day of an Interest Period
applicable to the relevant Loans that are LIBOR Loans (or such earlier date or
dates as shall be requested by the Borrower), to repay an aggregate principal
amount of such Loans equal to the Affected LIBOR Loans not initially prepaid
pursuant to this sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the immediately preceding sentence, all amounts deposited as cash collateral
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be held for the sole
benefit of the Lenders whose Loans would otherwise have been immediately prepaid
with the amounts deposited and may be applied to the prepayment of such Loans
immediately if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  (c)      Notice of Prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the
Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment
hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a LIBOR Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of
prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment
or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00
noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of
optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice
of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice
(other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment
of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02 except as
necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.12.

                  (d)      Prepayment of a Non-consenting Bank. In the event the
Borrower is entitled to replace a non-consenting Lender pursuant to Section
9.02(c), the Borrower shall have the right, upon five Business Days' prior
written notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders), to prepay all Loans,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, fees and other amounts, owing to such
Lender in accordance with Section 9.02(c) so long as (i) in the case of the
prepayment of the Loans of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10(d), the
Commitment of such Lender is terminated concurrently with such prepayment
pursuant to Section 2.08(d), and (ii) in the case of the prepayment of the Loans
of any Lender, the consents required by Section 9.02(c) in connection with the
prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) shall have been obtained, and at
such time, such Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes of
this Agreement, except with respect to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 (other
than Section 9.03(c)) of this Agreement, which shall survive as to such Lender.

                  (e)      Control of Cash and Application to Obligations. When
collected funds in the Cash Concentration Account (as defined in the Security
Agreement) are required to be deposited in the Collateral Proceeds Account (as
defined in the Security Agreement) and are not required to be transferred to the
General Funds Account, the collected funds on deposit in the Collateral Proceeds
Account (the "Available Cash") shall be applied by the Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Lenders as follows:

                           (i)      first, as a payment of the outstanding
principal amount of the Swingline Loans, second, as a payment of accrued and
unpaid interest on Swingline Loans, third, as a payment of the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans, fourth, as a payment of accrued and
unpaid interest on the Revolving Loans, and fifth, to the repayment of any other
Obligations which are due and

                                       36
<PAGE>

outstanding, and if after the foregoing applications, Available Cash remains
available to be disbursed, the Administrative Agent shall deposit such remaining
amount to the General Funds Account or transfer such funds as Borrower shall
otherwise direct; or

                           (ii)     if an Event of Default exists and the
Collateral Agent has determined to exercise its remedies in the Collateral as a
result thereof (other than the remedies provided for in Section 5.01 of the
Security Agreement), the Available Cash shall be applied by the Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Secured Parties to the Obligations in accordance with
Section 2.17.

         Section 2.11.     Fees.

                  (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the
Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily unused amount of the Commitment of such
Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding
the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be
payable in arrears on the date which is three Business Days following the last
day of each March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on
which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
commitment fees, a Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the
extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and
the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).

                  (b)      The Borrower agrees to pay: (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in all the Documentary Letters of Credit, during the period from
and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which
such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to
have any LC Exposure applicable to Documentary Letters of Credit, which fee
shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR
Borrowings minus 0.75% on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure
attributable to Documentary Letters of Credit (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements); (ii) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in all the Letters of Credit (other than the Documentary Letters
of Credit), during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and
the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, which fee shall
accrue at the same rate per annum as the Applicable Margin with respect to LIBOR
Borrowings on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding
any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements and
Documentary Letters of Credit); and (iii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee,
which shall accrue at the rate of 1/4 of 1% per annum on the average daily
aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing
of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and
including the last day of each month shall be payable on the third Business Day
following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Effective Date. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this
paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees
and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                  (c)      The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                                       37
<PAGE>

                  (d)      All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates
due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the
Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case
of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto.
Absent manifest error in the calculation thereof, fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

         Section 2.12.     Interest.

                  (a)      The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including
each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin per annum.

                  (b)      The Loans comprising each LIBOR Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin per annum.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section.

                  (d)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in
arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the
Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of
this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end
of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
in the event of any conversion of any LIBOR Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion.

                  (e)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime
Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate
Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent,
and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         Section 2.13.     Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing:

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent determines (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such
Interest Period; or

                  (b)      the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans
included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBOR

                                       38
<PAGE>

Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a
LIBOR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         Section 2.14.     Increased Costs.

                  (a)      If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or

                           (ii)     impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or
the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation
therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation
to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing
Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

                  (b)      If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or
on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any,
as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in
Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or
such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for
such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing
Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or an Issuing Bank's holding
company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower
will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank
or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

                  (c)      A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing
Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)
or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                  (d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such
compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or
such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in
Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or
such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

         Section 2.15.     Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default
or as a result of the operation of Section 2.18), (b) the conversion of any
LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
(c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the
date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether
such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(c) and is revoked in accordance
therewith), or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.08(d) or Section 2.18(b), then, in any such
event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a LIBOR Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and
period from other banks in the LIBOR market. A certificate of any Lender setting
forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         Section 2.16.     Taxes.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative
Agent, each Lender and such Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing
Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority,
the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment,

                                       40
<PAGE>

a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e)      Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of the deduction, withholding or payment of an Indemnified Tax or
Other Tax under the law of the United States or the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located (or any political subdivision thereof), or any treaty to
which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this
Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate.

                  (f)      If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines in
good faith, but in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund (or a
reduction in Taxes attributable to foreign tax credits) in respect of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower
(but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid,
by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund
or reduction in Taxes); provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the request
of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over
to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this Section 2.16(f)
shall require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

         Section 2.17.     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs; Distribution of Proceeds of Collateral.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall make each payment required to be
made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal,
interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under
Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 394
North Service Road, 3rd Floor, Melville, New York, except payments to be made
directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and
except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be
made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other
Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

                  (b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC

                                       41
<PAGE>

Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then
due to such parties.

                  (c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal
of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and
Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of
all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or
participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower
has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing
Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount
is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required
to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or
9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  (f)      Proceeds from the sale of, or other realization upon,
all or any part of the Collateral (including, without limitation, any amounts
paid as adequate protection payments or any other distributions in any
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding made on or in respect of any Collateral)
when an Event of Default exists and the Collateral Agent has determined to
exercise remedies in the Collateral as a result thereof (other than the remedies
provided for in Section 5.01 of the Security Agreement) shall, notwithstanding
anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, first be applied as payment of
the accrued and unpaid fees of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
under the Loan Documents and then to all other unpaid or unreimbursed
Obligations (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) owing to either
the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as such only

                                       42
<PAGE>

and then any remaining amount of such proceeds together with any payments under
any other Loan Documents shall be distributed:

                           (i)      first, to the Secured Parties, pro rata in
accordance with the respective unpaid amounts of all Obligations (other than the
Obligations of the type described in clauses (c) and (d) of the definition
thereof set forth in the Security Agreement), until all such Obligations have
been paid and satisfied in full or cash collateralized;

                           (ii)     second, to the Secured Parties, pro rata in
accordance with the respective unpaid amounts of the Obligations of the type
described in clause (d) of the definition thereof set forth in the Security
Agreement (i.e., those arising in connection with the treasury, depositary and
cash management services), until all such Obligations have been paid and
satisfied in full or cash collateralized;

                           (iii)    third, to the Secured Parties, pro rata in
accordance with the respective unpaid amounts of the Obligations of the type
described in clause (c) of the definition thereof set forth in the Security
Agreement (i.e., those arising in connection with Hedging Agreements), until all
such Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full or cash collateralized;
and

                           (iv)     fourth, to the Secured Parties, pro rata in
accordance with the respective unpaid amounts of any remaining Obligations.

After all the Obligations (including without limitation, all contingent
Obligations) have been paid and satisfied in full, all Commitments terminated
and all other obligations of any Secured Party to any Loan Party otherwise
satisfied, any proceeds of Collateral shall be delivered to the Person entitled
thereto as directed by Borrower or as otherwise determined by applicable law or
applicable court order. Portions of the proceeds of the Collateral distributed
pursuant to the forgoing may thereafter be held by the Collateral Agent, the
Administrative Agent or a Secured Party as collateral for contingent
reimbursement Obligations relating to Letters of Credit or contingent settlement
Obligations relating to Hedging Agreements. In the event that such contingent
Obligations do not become liquidated and are no longer outstanding, the party
holding the proceeds securing such Obligations agrees to return them to the
Collateral Agent for distribution in accordance with this Section 2.17.

                  (g)      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, if the Collateral Agent shall ever acquire any Collateral through
foreclosure or by a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or by retaining any of the
Collateral in satisfaction of all or part of the Obligations or if any proceeds
of Collateral received by the Collateral Agent to be distributed and shared
pursuant to this Section 2.17 are in a form other than immediately available
funds, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to remit any share thereof
under the terms hereof and the Secured Parties shall only be entitled to their
undivided interests in the Collateral or noncash proceeds as determined by this
Section 2.17. The Secured Parties shall receive the applicable portions (in
accordance with the foregoing paragraph) of any immediately available funds
consisting of proceeds from such Collateral or proceeds of such noncash proceeds
so acquired only if and when received by the Collateral Agent in connection with
the subsequent disposition thereof. While any Collateral or other property to be
shared pursuant to this Section 2.17 is held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to
this paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall hold such Collateral or other
property for the benefit of the Secured Parties and all matters relating to the
management, operation, further disposition or any other aspect of such
Collateral or other property shall be resolved by the agreement of the Required
Lenders.

         Section 2.18.     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

                  (a)      If any Lender requests compensation under Section
2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender
or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

                  (b)      If any Lender requests compensation under Section
2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender
or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then
the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case
of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section
2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment
will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                         Representations and Warranties
                         ------------------------------

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

         Section 3.01.     Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

         Section 3.02.     Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required,
stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party
is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party (as the
case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and

                                       44
<PAGE>

subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law.

         Section 3.03.     Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except (i) such
as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (ii) filings
necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan Documents, and (iii) routine
corporate filings to maintain the good standing of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the
charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or
result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a
right thereunder to require any payment (other than the payments required to be
made under the Loan Documents and the Original Credit Agreement) to be made by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that the representation in
this clause (c) is subject to obtaining certain consents that are required under
certain of such agreements or other instruments, which either have been obtained
or the failure to obtain such consents would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except
Liens created under the Loan Documents.

         Section 3.04.     Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.

                  (a)      The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders:
(i) its consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended on February 1, 2003,
reported on by Deloitte & Touche LLP independent public accountants; and (ii)
its unaudited consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal month ended on or
about March 31, 2003 and the portion of the fiscal year then ended. Such
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower as of such
dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject, in the case of the
fiscal month end statements, to normal year-end adjustments..

                  (b)      The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders
its pro forma consolidated and consolidating statements of operation, balance
sheets and cash flow projections (including detailed capital expenditures) for
the fiscal year ending on or approximately January 31, 2004, and on an annual
basis for fiscal years 2004 through 2007. Such pro forma consolidated balance
sheet: (i) has been prepared in good faith, (ii) is based upon assumptions
believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable at the time, it being
recognized that actual results during the period or periods covered by such
information may differ materially from the projected or estimated results set
forth therein, and (iii) accurately reflects all adjustments necessary to give
effect to the Transactions.

                  (c)      Except: (i) as disclosed in the financial statements
referred to above or the notes thereto or in the Information Memorandum and (ii)
for the Disclosed Matters, none of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries has, as of
the Effective Date, any material contingent liabilities, unusual long-term
commitments or unrealized losses.

                  (d)      Since February 1, 2003, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                                       45
<PAGE>

         Section 3.05.     Properties.

                  (a)      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good
title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property
material to its business (including the Collateral), except for minor defects in
title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes
free and clear of Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances and Liens permitted by
Section 6.02.

                  (b)      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 3.06.     Litigation and Environmental Matters.

                  (a)      There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or
before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an
adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

                  (b)      Except with respect to any other matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i)
has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply
with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law,
(ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received
notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of
any basis for any Environmental Liability.

                  (c)      Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no
change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.07.     Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has
occurred and is continuing.

         Section 3.08.     Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined
in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         Section 3.09.     Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
timely filed or caused to be filed all income tax returns and other material Tax
returns and reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be
paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or
such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or
(b) to the extent that the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       46
<PAGE>

         Section 3.10.     ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $2,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $5,000,000 of the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

         Section 3.11.     Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders
all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to
any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information
Memorandum nor any other reports, financial statements, certificates or other
information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder contained, as of the
date that such Information Memorandum, report, financial statement, certificate

have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other
applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with the hours worked by
or payments made to employees or any similar matters and (b) all payments due
from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and

bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such

                  (a)      The Pledge Agreement is effective to create in favor
of the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a
legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in
the Pledge Agreement) and, when such Collateral is delivered to the Collateral
Agent, the Pledge Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected first priority
Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of each pledgor
thereunder in such Collateral, in each case prior and superior in right to any
other Person.

                  (b)      The Security Agreement is effective to create in
favor of the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a
legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in

interest in, all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such
Collateral, to the extent that a security interest can be perfected in such
Collateral by filing, recording or registering a financing statement or
analogous document in the United States of America (or any political subdivision
thereof) and its territories and possessions pursuant to the Uniform Commercial
Code or other applicable law in such jurisdiction, in each case prior and

security interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registering a
security agreement, financing statement or analogous document in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, as
applicable, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person other
than Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02 (it being understood that
subsequent recordings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the
United States Copyright Office may be necessary to perfect a Lien on registered
trademarks, trademark applications and copyrights acquired by the Loan Parties
after the date hereof).

         Section 3.17.     Margin Securities. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin
stock (within the meaning of Regulations U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System), and no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to

purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose

<PAGE>

                  (c)      At the time of and immediately after giving effect to

of Credit, as applicable, the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the

         Section 4.03.     Effective Date Advances and Adjustments. On the

Credit Agreement are being increased hereunder but not all Lenders are providing
their Applicable Percentage (determined under the Original Credit Agreement) of
the amount of the increase. As a result, the loans outstanding under the
Original Credit Agreement which are continued hereunder will not be held pro
rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Applicable Percentage determined
hereunder. To remedy the forgoing, on the Effective Date and upon fulfillment of
the conditions in Section 4.01, the Lenders shall make advances among themselves
so that after giving effect thereto the Loans (which are not Swingline Loans)
will be held by the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with the Applicable
Percentage hereunder. The advances made on the Effective Date under this Section
4.03 by each Lender whose Applicable Percentage has increased (as compared to
its "Applicable Percentage" under the Original Credit Agreement) shall be deemed
to be a purchase of a corresponding amount of the Loans of the Lender or Lenders
whose Applicable Percentage have decreased (as compared to the "Applicable
Percentage" under the Original Credit Agreement). The advances made under this
Section 4.03 shall be ABR Loans made under each Lender's Commitment. All
advances made under this Section 4.03 and to "Assignors" under the Master
Assignment and Acceptance dated as of the date hereof on the Effective Date
shall be made through the Administrative Agent.

in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and all LC
Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, the Borrower covenants and agrees with
the Lenders that:

                  (a)      The Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies (i) adequate insurance for its insurable properties, all to such
extent and against such risks, including fire, casualty and other risks insured
against by extended coverage, as is customary with companies in the same or
similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations, (ii) such other
insurance as is required pursuant to the terms of any Security Document and

                  (b)      Fire and extended coverage policies maintained with
respect to any Collateral shall be endorsed or otherwise amended to include (i)
a non-contributing mortgage clause (regarding improvements to real property) and
lenders' loss payable clause (regarding personal property), in each case in
favor of the Collateral Agent and providing for losses thereunder to be payable
to the Collateral Agent or its designee, (ii) a provision to the effect that
neither the Collateral Agent nor any other party shall be a coinsurer and (iii)
such other provisions as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require from
time to time to protect the interests of the Lenders. Commercial general
liability policies shall be endorsed to name the Collateral Agent as an
additional insured. Business interruption policies shall name the Collateral
Agent as loss payee. Each such policy referred to in this paragraph also shall
provide that it shall not be canceled, modified or not renewed (i) by reason of
nonpayment of premium except upon not less than 10 days' prior written notice
thereof by the insurer to the Collateral Agent (giving the Collateral Agent the
right to cure defaults in the payment of premiums) or (ii) for any other reason
except upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice thereof by the insurer
to the Collateral Agent. The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent,
prior to the cancellation, modification or non-renewal of any such policy of
insurance, a copy of a renewal or replacement policy (or other evidence of
renewal of a policy previously delivered to the Administrative Agent) together
with evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent of payment of the premium
therefor.

         Section 5.08.     Casualty and Condemnation.

                  (a)      The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders prompt written notice of any casualty or other insured damage to
any material portion of any Collateral or the commencement of any action or
proceeding for the taking of any Collateral or any part thereof or interest
therein under power of eminent domain or by condemnation or similar proceeding.

                  (b)      If any event described in paragraph (a) of this
Section results in Net Cash Proceeds (whether in the form of insurance proceeds,
condemnation award or otherwise) payable with respect to any Collateral, the
Collateral Agent is authorized to collect such Net Cash Proceeds and, if
received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, such Net Cash Proceeds shall be
treated as Daily Receipts (as defined in the Security Agreement) and paid over
to the Collateral Agent as required by Section 5.01 of the Security Agreement;
provided that notwithstanding anything in the Security Agreement to the
contrary, (i) if the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds in respect of such event (other
than proceeds of business income insurance) are less than $1,000,000, such Net
Cash Proceeds shall be paid over to the Borrower unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and (ii) all proceeds of business income insurance
(including any remaining business interruption insurance proceeds payable in
connection with the casualty loss to the Borrower's Greenwood Indiana store)
shall be paid over to the Borrower unless an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

         Section 5.09.     Books and Records; Inspection and Audit Rights.

                  (a)      Books and Records; Inspection. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of record and account
in which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and
transactions in relation to its business and activities. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit
and inspect its properties, to examine and make extracts from its books and
records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers
and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as
reasonably requested; provided that the Borrower shall be given the opportunity
to be present at any discussion with its independent accountants.

                  (b)      Field Examinations. The Borrower will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, permit the Administrative Agent or any
representatives designated by the Administrative Agent

                                       55
<PAGE>

(including any consultants, accountants, lawyers and appraisers) to conduct two
commercial field examinations of the assets included in the Borrowing Base prior
to the first anniversary of the Effective Date and one such field examination in
each twelve month period following the first anniversary of the Effective Date
(each twelve month period following the Effective Date, herein a "Loan Year").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the time that an Event of Default arising
as a result of the failure to comply with the obligations under Section 5.01(f),
under clause (c) of Section 7.01 with respect to any Borrowing Base Certificate
or any financial statement, or under clauses (a), (b), (d), (f) through (k), (m)
or (o) of Section 7.01 (collectively, the "Significant Events of Defaults")
exists, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to conduct at any time and
from time to time, and the Borrower shall have the obligation to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses relating to, any field examination that the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. If the Borrower requests that any
assets acquired in a Permitted Acquisition be included in the Borrowing Base,
the Borrower shall have the obligation to pay the reasonable fees and expenses
relating to any field examination required by the Administrative Agent relating
to such assets.

                  (c)      Appraisal. The Borrower will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the Administrative
Agent (including any consultants, accountants, lawyers and appraisers) to
conduct appraisals of the Inventory and Mortgaged Property, all at such
reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested. The Borrower shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of any representatives retained by the
Administrative Agent to conduct such appraisals; provided that: (i) the Borrower
shall only be required to pay such fees and expenses relating to the appraisal
of Inventory conducted prior to the Effective Date and the fees and expenses
relating to the appraisals of Inventory conducted once each Loan Year after the
first Loan Year and (ii) the Borrower shall only be required to pay for the
first appraisal of each parcel of Mortgaged Property required by Section 5.15(d)
and one appraisal of such Mortgaged Property conducted in each twelve month
period following the date such property became "Mortgaged Property".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) at any time that Availability is less than
$20,000,000, the Borrower will be obligated to pay for one additional inventory
appraisal during each Loan Year and (b) during the time that a Significant Event
of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
relating to any appraisal of the Inventory or the Mortgaged Property that the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. If the Borrower requests that any
assets acquired in a Permitted Acquisition be included in the Borrowing Base,
the Borrower shall have the obligation to pay the reasonable fees and expenses
relating to any appraisal of such assets required by the Administrative Agent.
Subject to the terms of this Section 5.09(c), the Administrative Agent shall
conduct such appraisals of the Inventory of the Loan Parties and Mortgaged
Property as the Required Lenders may reasonable request.

         Section 5.10.     Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property
(including, without limitation, Environmental Laws), except where the failure to
do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.11.     Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit. The proceeds
of the Loans will be used: (a) for the payment of fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions and (b) for the other general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures, the payment of permitted Indebtedness
when due and working capital. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used,
whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any
of the Regulations of the Board, including Regulations T, U and X. Letters of
Credit will be issued only for general corporate purposes.

         Section 5.12.     Additional Subsidiaries. If any Subsidiary is formed
or acquired after the Effective Date, the Borrower will notify the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof and (a) if such Subsidiary is
organized under the laws of the United States of America or any jurisdiction
therein, (i) the

                                       56
<PAGE>

Borrower will cause such Subsidiary to execute and deliver a Subsidiary
Guarantee Agreement, (ii) such Subsidiary will execute and deliver a supplement
to the Indemnity, Subrogation and Contribution Agreement to cause such
Subsidiary to become a party thereto and (iii) the Borrower will cause such
Subsidiary to become a party to each applicable Security Document in the manner
provided therein, in each case within three Business Days after such Subsidiary
is formed or acquired and promptly take such actions to create and perfect Liens
on such Subsidiary's assets to secure the Obligations as the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders shall reasonably request and (b) if any Equity
Interests or Indebtedness of such Subsidiary are owned by or on behalf of any
Loan Party, the Borrower will cause such Equity Interests and promissory notes
evidencing such Indebtedness to be pledged pursuant to the Pledge Agreement
within three Business Days after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired.

         Section 5.13.     Further Assurances. The Borrower will, and will cause
each Subsidiary Loan Party to, execute any and all further documents, agreements
and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and
recording of financing statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust
and other documents), which may be required under any applicable law, or which
either the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably request,
to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or to grant,
preserve, protect or perfect the Liens created or intended to be created by the
Security Documents or the validity or priority of any such Lien, all at the
expense of the Loan Parties. The Borrower also agrees to provide to the
Administrative Agent, from time to time upon request, evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to the perfection and priority of
the Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents.

         Section 5.14.     Leaseholds and other Contractual Obligations. The
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay all Leasehold
Obligations and perform in all material respects all other obligations under all
leases and other agreements pertaining to any premises where any Inventory which
is included in the Borrowing Base is stored or located, keep such leases and
agreements in full force and effect and not allow any termination or
cancellation thereof. The Borrower will notify the Administrative Agent promptly
in the event of any default or alleged default under any such lease or agreement
and will exercise diligent efforts to cure any such default. The Borrower will,
and will cause each Subsidiary to, comply with all agreements, contracts, and
instruments binding on it or affecting its properties or business other than
such noncompliance which is not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 5.15.     Mortgaged Property.

                  (a)      Mortgage of Mortgaged Property. Borrower shall have
the option of granting a Mortgage on real property and improvements that it or
any Loan Party owns in fee simple or that it or any Loan Party leases, so that
such real property shall become "Mortgaged Property" for purposes of the
Borrowing Base. The obligations of the Lenders to include a parcel of real
property as "Mortgaged Property" under the Borrowing Base are subject to the
condition precedent that the Administrative Agent shall have received all of the
following, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent:

                           (i)      Mortgage and Related Documents. A Mortgage
executed by the Loan Party who owns the property with evidence of its recording
in the applicable real property records and, if the Loan Party's interest in the
real property is created pursuant to a lease, the following:

                                    (A)      A copy and, if available, a summary
of, the applicable lease agreement;

                                    (B)      Evidence that the lease agreement,
or a memorandum thereof, shall have been recorded in the applicable real
property records; and

                                       57
<PAGE>

                                    (C)      A consent to the grant by the
applicable Loan Party of a Lien to the Collateral Agent in the Loan Party's
interest in the related leasehold estate, such consent to contain the consents
and non-disturbance provisions substantially similar to those set forth in
Schedule 5.15 or otherwise to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Collateral Agent and to be accompanied with evidence of its recording in
the applicable real property records; and

                                    (D)      A landlord estoppel letter pursuant
to which the applicable landlord shall certify, represent or warrant as to the
then current status of the lease (e.g. current status of the Loan Party's
performance) and such other matters as the Collateral Agent may reasonably
request, such estoppel letter to otherwise be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

                           (ii)     Mortgage Policies. A lender's title
insurance policy issued by title insurers reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent (a "Mortgage Policy") in form and substance and in amounts
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent assuring that the Mortgage
which cover such property creates a valid and enforceable first priority
mortgage lien on the property, free and clear of all defects and encumbrances
except for minor defects in title that do not impair the value thereof and other
defects and encumbrances approved by the Administrative Agent. The Mortgage
Policy shall include an endorsement insuring against the effect of future
advances under this Agreement, for mechanics' liens and for any other matter
that the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, and shall provide for
affirmative insurance and such reinsurance as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request.

                           (iii)    Surveys. A current survey, certified by a
licensed surveyor meeting ALTA requirements, in a form sufficient to allow the
issuer of the Mortgage Policy to issue a lender's policy.

                           (iv)     Appraisals. A current appraisal of the
property which appraisal shall, if it is applicable to any leasehold property,
appraise separately the market value of any improvements owned by a Loan Party
and the market value attributable to the leasehold interest in the underlying
land.

                           (v)      Environmental Reports. An environmental
report for the parcel, prepared by a third party environmental engineer
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such further analysis of the
environmental condition of the property as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably require.

                           (vi)     Flood Insurance. Flood insurance or evidence
that the parcel is not located in a Special Flood Hazard Area as designated by
the National Flood Insurance Program.

If Agent at any time has reasonable basis to believe that there may be a
material violation of any Environmental Laws by, or any material liability
arising thereunder of, Borrower or any Subsidiary or related to any Mortgaged
Property or real property adjacent to any Mortgaged Property, then Borrower
agrees, upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent to either: (A)
provide the Administrative Agent with such environmental reports and
assessments, certificates, engineering studies or other written material or data
as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require relating thereto or (B)
request a release of the Collateral Agent's Lien in the Mortgage Property in
question in accordance with Section 5.15(b) and otherwise comply with the
requirements set forth in Section 5.15(b) in order to be entitled to such
release. In the event that the Administrative Agent determines from the
environmental reports or information delivered pursuant to this Section 5.15 or
pursuant to any other information, that remedial action to correct an
environmental condition is necessary with respect to any Mortgaged Property,
Borrower shall take such action or other action as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably require to cure, or protect against, any material violation or
potential violation of any Environmental Laws or any material actual or
potential environmental liability.

Agent and the Collateral Agent are authorized to release any Lien in any
Mortgaged Property at any time and from time to time at the Borrower's request
if, as of the date of the requested release: (i) no Default exists; (ii) the
Borrower complies with its obligations under Section 2.10(b) simultaneously with

with: (A) an updated pro forma Borrowing Base Certificate prepared within three
days of the date of delivery and giving effect to such release and any payment
required by Section 2.10(b) and (B) a certificate stating that no Default then
exists.

the Administrative Agent, promptly pay any amount expended by the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders in connection with such performance or attempted
performance to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon at the
applicable default rate from and including the date of such expenditure to but
excluding the date such expenditure is paid in full. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is expressly agreed that neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Lender shall have any liability or responsibility for the performance of any
obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document. The Collateral Agent may
be obligated to pay certain amounts to the financial institutions party to the
cash management and control agreements executed pursuant to the Security
Agreement from time to time, including without limitations, fees owed to such
financial institutions arising from their lock box and other deposit account
services and amounts sufficient to reimburse such financial institutions for the
amount of any item deposited in the related account which is returned unpaid. In
the event either the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is required to pay
any such amounts, the applicable agent shall notify Borrower and Borrower shall
promptly pay any amount so expended by the applicable agent to the applicable
agent together with interest at the applicable default rate from and including
the date of such expenditure to but excluding the date that such expenditure is
paid in full. Amounts due and unpaid under this Section 7.2 may be funded as
Swingline Loans or Revolving Loans pursuant to the terms of Section 2.03(b).

         Section 7.03.     Continuance of Default. For purposes of all Loan
Documents, any Default that is capable of being remedied shall be deemed to have
continued and exist until the Administrative Agent shall have actually received
evidence which it in good faith deems satisfactory that such Default shall have
been remedied.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                            The Administrative Agent
                            ------------------------

         Each of the Lenders and an Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the
JPMorgan Chase Bank as its agent (and confirms and continues such appointment
under the Original Credit Agreement) and authorizes JPMorgan Chase Bank to take
such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent by the terms of the Loan
Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, the Collateral Agent
is authorized by the Lenders to release the Liens created by the Prior Security
Agreement (as that term is defined in the Security Agreement) in the Equipment
and Fixtures (as those terms are defined in the Security Agreement) as
contemplated by Section 7.17 of the Security Agreement.

         The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

         The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is
communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any
of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a
Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation
made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection
therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or
any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than
to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing

                                       69
<PAGE>

believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper
Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it
orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

         The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, in consultation with the Borrower and on
behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an
Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the
Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

         Congress Financial Corporation (Central) has been designated as co-lead
arranger, Congress Financial Corporation (Central) and Fleet Retail Finance Inc.
have been designated as "co-syndication agent", Foothill Capital Corporation and
National City Commercial Finance, Inc. have been designated as "co-documentation
agent", and Bank of America, N.A., The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc., and
LaSalle Business Credit have been designated as "co-agents" hereunder in
recognition of the level of each of their respective Commitments. None of the
parties listed in the foregoing sentence is an agent for the Lenders and no such
Lender shall have any obligation hereunder other than those existing in its
capacity as a Lender. Without limiting the foregoing, no such Lender shall have
or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Lender.

                                       70
<PAGE>

         No Secured Party (other than the Lenders and the Issuing Bank) shall
have any right to give any direction to either the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent in the exercise of such agent's rights and obligations under
the Loan Documents nor does any such Secured Party have any right to consent to,
or vote on, any matter hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities to any Secured Party except those expressly set forth in the
Loan Documents.

         Neither the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender nor any of their
respective Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them hereunder or otherwise in connection with any Loan Document
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, neither the Issuing Bank nor
the Swingline Lender: (i) shall have any duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of any Loan
Document be a trustee or fiduciary for any Secured Party, (ii) shall be
responsible to any Secured Party for any recitals, statements, representations,
or warranties contained in any Loan Document, or any certificate or other
documentation referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under,
any Loan Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, enforceability, or
sufficiency of any Loan Document or any other documentation referred to or
provided for therein or for any failure by any Person to perform any of its
obligations thereunder, (iii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel
for any Borrower), independent public accountants, and other experts selected by
it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants, or
experts, and (iv) shall incur no liability under or in respect of any Loan
Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, or other instrument or
writing believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or
parties. As to any matters not expressly provided for by any Loan Document, the
Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions
signed by the Required Lenders, and such instructions of the Required Lenders
and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
of the Secured Parties; provided, however, that neither the Issuing Bank nor the
Swingline Lender shall be required to take any action which exposes it to
personal liability or which is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law.

         The provisions of this Article applicable to the Administrative Agent
also shall apply to the Collateral Agent, mutatis mutandis.

         The Collateral Agent hereby appoints each of the other Lenders to serve
as bailee to perfect the Collateral Agent's Liens in any Collateral in the
possession of any such other Lender. Each Lender possessing any Collateral
agrees to so act as bailee for the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms
and provisions hereof. In furtherance of the forgoing, each Lender acknowledges
that the Borrower and certain of the Subsidiary Loan Parties may maintain
deposit accounts at one or more of the Lenders which are not covered by the
terms of the Cash Concentration Letter Agreement or one of the Collection
Deposit Letter Agreements (all such accounts not so covered, the "Loan Party
Accounts"). Each Lender agrees to hold its Loan Party Accounts as bailee for the
Collateral Agent to perfect the Collateral Agent's Liens in the proceeds of
Collateral held therein. Prior to the receipt by a Lender of a written notice of
an Event of Default from the Collateral Agent, the Borrower and the Subsidiary
Loan Party are entitled to make withdrawals from the Loan Party Accounts and
make deposits into all the Loan Party Accounts. When a Lender has received a
written notice of an Event of Default from the Collateral Agent, (a) the
Collateral Agent shall be the only party entitled to make withdrawals from or
otherwise give any direction with respect to the Loan Party Accounts, and (b)
each Lender shall transfer, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to
the Collateral Agent, the amount of the collected funds credited to the Loan
Party Accounts it holds and deliver to the Collateral Agent all moneys or
instruments relating thereto or held therein and any other Collateral at any
time the Collateral Agent demands payment or delivery thereof by such written
notice to such Lender. The Borrower and each Subsidiary Loan Party agrees that
each

                                       71
<PAGE>

Lender is authorized to immediately deliver all the Collateral to the Collateral
Agent upon the Lender's receipt of such notice from the Collateral Agent. No
Lender (other than the Collateral Agent acting for the benefit of the Lenders)
shall exercise any right of set-off or banker's lien against any Loan Party
Account for any obligations other than the Obligations; provided that a Lender
shall be entitled to charge, or set-off against a Loan Party Account and retain
for its own account, any customary fees, costs, charges and expenses owed to it
in connection with the opening, operating and maintaining such Loan Party
Account and for the amount of any item credited to such Loan Party Account that
is subsequently returned for any reason.

         No Lender who is also engaged by a Loan Party to process the payments
relating to credit cards shall exercise any right of set-off or banker's lien
against any Collateral for any obligations other than the Obligations and the
obligations under the applicable agreements relating to the Merchant Account (as
herein defined); provided that such Lender shall be entitled to charge, or
set-off against Collateral and retain for its own account, any customary fees,
costs, charges and expenses owed to it under the terms of the agreements
relating to the Merchant Account or arising in connection with the opening,
operating and maintaining such Merchant Account. For purposes of this Article
VIII, a "Merchant Account" means any account, agreement or arrangement between a
Loan Party and another Person pursuant to which such other Person gives or makes
available credit to such Loan Party in respect of credit card transactions
generated by such Loan Party or has agreed to process the payment of Credit Card
Receivables of such Loan Party. The restrictions on a Lender's set-off rights as
set forth in this Article VIII shall continue after such institution is no
longer a Lender hereunder. Each Lender hereby consents to the Borrower assigning
its rights under any agreement relating to a Merchant Account to which such
Lender is a party to the Collateral Agent. Furthermore, the Borrower and each
such Lender agree not to amend any such agreements in a manner that would
adversely affect the Collateral Agent's rights thereunder. This paragraph in no
way modifies the Loan Parties' obligation to execute and maintain Collection
Deposit Letter Agreements in accordance with Section 5.01 of the Security
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX.

Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or
furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the
Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices
pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and
the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its
discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by
electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that
approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or
communications. Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for
notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
given on the date of receipt.

         Section 9.02.     Waivers; Amendments; Permitted Release of Liens.

                  (a)      No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan
Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this
Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not
be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b)      Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document
nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except
(x) pursuant to an Increased Commitment Supplement executed in accordance with
Section 2.08(e) which only needs to be signed by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders increasing or providing new Commitments
thereunder if the Increased Commitment Supplement does not increase the
aggregate amount of the Commitments to an amount in excess of $300,000,000 and
(y) in the case of this Agreement and any circumstance other than as described
in clause (x), pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by
the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan
Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the Loan Party
or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the
Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the
Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce
the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of
payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest
thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv)
change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v)
change any of the provisions of this Section or the definitions of "Required
Lenders" or "Supermajority Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release any
Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Subsidiary Guarantee
Agreement (except as

                                       73
<PAGE>

expressly provided in the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement), or limit
its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each
Lender, (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens
of the Security Documents (other than in connection with any disposition
expressly permitted hereby, including, any release of any parcel of the
Mortgaged Property in accordance with Section 5.15(b)), without the written
consent of each Lender, (viii) change any of the provisions of the definitions
of "Borrowing Base", "Eligible Inventory" or "Eligible Credit Card Receivable"
in a manner that adversely affects the interests of the Lenders without the
written consent of the Supermajority Lenders or (ix) amend or waive compliance
with the requirements of Section 6.13 (i.e., the Minimum Availability covenant),
without the written consent of the Supermajority Lenders; provided further that
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may
be. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are irrevocably authorized
by the Lenders, without the further consent or agreement of any Secured Party,
to release Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents: (A) if such
release is in connection with any disposition expressly permitted hereby,
including, any release of any parcel of the Mortgaged Property in accordance
with Section 5.15(b) and (B) upon termination of the Commitments,
collateralization of all outstanding Letters of Credit and payment and
satisfaction of all other non-contingent Obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (c)      If, in connection with any proposed amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of or to any of the provisions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents contemplated by the first proviso to
Section 9.02(b) the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent
of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained,
then the Borrower shall have the right to either (i) replace any such
non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more replacement Lenders in the
same manner as provided in Section 2.18(b) so long as at the time of such
replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed amendment,
modification, termination or waiver, or (ii) terminate any such non-consenting
Lender's Commitment and repay in full its outstanding Loans in accordance with
Sections 2.08(d) and 2.10(d); provided that unless the Commitments that are
terminated and the Loans that are repaid pursuant to the preceding clause (ii)
are immediately replaced in full at such time through the addition of new
Lenders or the increase of the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of existing
Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto), then in the case
of any action pursuant to the preceding clause (ii), each Lender (other than the
terminated Lender or Lenders) must consent to such termination.

         Section 9.03.     Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by JPMorgan Chase Bank and its respective
Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder; (iii)
subject to the provisions of Section 5.09, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by JPMorgan Chase Bank and its respective Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with any filing, registration,
recording or perfection of any security interest or other Lien contemplated by
any Loan Document, or any audit, appraisal, inspection, environmental
assessment, survey or title insurance policy relating to any Collateral and (iv)
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for

                                       74
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender,
in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection
with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in
connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including
all such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

                  (b)      The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
"Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to
the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom
(including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual
or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any Mortgaged
Property or any other property currently or formerly owned or operated by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in
any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c)      To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any
amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may
be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Issuing
Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.

                  (d)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee,
on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use
of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e)      All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor and may be funded as Swingline Loans or
Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.03(b).

         Section 9.04.     Successors and Assigns.

                  (a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not

the prior written consent of each

Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such
consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this
Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in
clause (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b)      (i)      Subject to the conditions set forth in
clause (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

                                    (A)      the Borrower, provided that no
consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to any other assignee; and

                                    (B)      the Administrative Agent, provided
that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
of any Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment immediately
prior to giving effect to such assignment.

                           (ii)     Assignments shall be subject to the
following additional conditions:

                                    (A)      except in the case of an assignment
to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or an assignment of
the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the
amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less
than $10,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be
required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

                                    (B)      each partial assignment shall be
made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement;

                                    (C)      the parties to each assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

                                    (D)      the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire.

         For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved Fund"
means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making,
purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit
in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by
(a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of
an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                           (iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to clause (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender

                                       76
<PAGE>

thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section.

                           (iv)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy
of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any
Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

                           (v)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed
Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept
such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement
unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c)      (i)      Any Lender may, without the consent of the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi) or (vii) of
the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it
were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c)
as though it were a Lender.

                           (ii)     A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant
that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation
sold

                                       77
<PAGE>

to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (d)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release
a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         Section 9.05.     Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         Section 9.06.     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Amendment
and Restatement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by
different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a
single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate
letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent
embody the final, entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous commitments, agreements,
representations and understandings, whether oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof (including the Original Credit Agreement) and may not be
contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral
agreements or discussions of the parties hereto. There are no unwritten oral
agreements among the parties hereto. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement amends and restates in
its entirety the Original Credit Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents executed in connection herewith does not extinguish the
commitments under, the Liens created under or the indebtedness outstanding in
connection with the Original Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents nor
does it constitute a novation with respect to such commitment, Liens or such
indebtedness. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders ratify and
confirm each of the Loan Documents entered into prior to the Effective Date (but
excluding the Original Credit Agreement) and agree that such Loan Documents
continue to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms. The Borrower and each Subsidiary represents and warrants that
as of the Effective Date there are no claims or offsets against or defenses or
counterclaims to its obligations under the Original Credit Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents. To induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to
enter into this

                                       78
<PAGE>

Agreement, the Borrower and each Subsidiary waives any and all such claims,
offsets, defenses or counterclaims, whether known or unknown, arising prior to
the Effective Date and relating to the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
and notwithstanding any Loan Document to the contrary, the Borrower, the
Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree and acknowledge
that:

                                    (A)      the term "Credit Agreement" as used
in each Loan Document means this Agreement;

                                    (B)      the term "Obligations" as used in
the Security Agreement, Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement and Pledge Agreement
includes all of the obligations, indebtedness and liability of the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank and the Lenders, or any of them,
arising pursuant to this Agreement; and

                                    (C)      any reference to The Chase
Manhattan Bank in any Loan Document executed prior to the Effective Date shall
mean a reference to JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank).

         Section 9.07.     Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         Section 9.08.     Right of Setoff. Subject to the terms of any Cash
Concentration Letter Agreement or Collection Deposit Letter Agreement executed
pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement, if an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account
of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) which such Lender may have.

         Section 9.09.     Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process.

                  (a)      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the law of the State of New York (without regard to the
conflicts of law provisions thereof other than Section 5-1401 of New York's
General Obligations Law).

                  (b)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the

                                       79
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may
otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of
any jurisdiction.

                  (c)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

                  (d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         Section 9.10.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         Section 9.11.     Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         Section 9.12.     Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Banks and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below) in accordance with their customary procedures,
except that Information may be disclosed: (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section,
to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with
the consent of the Borrower, (h) to the extent such Information becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or becomes
available to the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or any Lender on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates; provided such source is not known by the receiving party to be bound
by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to Borrower, or (i) to any direct or indirect
contractual counterparty with a Lender or its Affiliates in a swap agreement or
such counterparty's professional advisor (so long as such contractual
counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to
be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.12); provided that,

                                       80
<PAGE>

unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender
shall notify the Borrower of any request by any regulatory authority or
representative thereof or pursuant to legal process (other than any such request
in connection with any examination of the financial condition of such Lender by
such regulatory authority) for disclosure of any such nonpublic information
prior to disclosure of such information. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a non-confidential basis
prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates; provided that, in
the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information. Notwithstanding anything in that commitment letter
dated March 27, 2003 between JPMorgan Chase Bank and the Borrower to the
contrary, the parties hereto may disclose to any Person, without limitation of
any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the Transactions and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to the Borrower relating to such tax treatment and tax structure,
except that, with respect to any document or similar item that in either case
contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transaction as well as other information, this proviso shall only apply to such
portions of the document or similar item that relate to the tax treatment or tax
structure of the Transactions.

         Section 9.13.     Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the "Charges"), shall exceed
the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

         Section 9.14.     No Fiduciary Relationship. The relationship between
the Loan Parties on the one hand and the Administrative Agent and each Lender on
the other is solely that of debtor and creditor, and neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary or other special relationship with any
Loan Party, and no term or condition of any of the Loan Documents shall be
construed so as to deem the relationship between the Loan Parties on the one
hand and the Administrative Agent and each Lender on the other to be other than
that of debtor and creditor.

                                       81
<PAGE>

         Section 9.15.     Construction. The Borrower, each other Loan Party (by
its execution of the Loan Documents to which its is a party), the Administrative
Agent and each Lender acknowledges that each of them has had the benefit of
legal counsel of its own choice and has been afforded an opportunity to review
the Loan Documents with its legal counsel and that the Loan Documents shall be
construed as if jointly drafted by the parties thereto.

         Section 9.16.     Independence of Covenants. All covenants under the
Loan Documents shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action
or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would
be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default if such action is
taken or such condition exists.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.

                                    Borrower:
