<PAGE>
Type which, if included in the Portfolio, would cause the Aggregate FMV of all
Portfolio Railcars of such Designated Type to exceed 30% of the Commitment

obligations under the proposed Lease, its performance record with respect to
other leases and debt obligations and its maintenance and operational

more frequently than once in any week), the Borrower may, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, borrow Loans in respect of each such Railcar
and related Lease which is an Eligible Railcar and/or Eligible Lease, as

Borrowing not later than 11:00 A.M. on the second Business Day prior to the date

Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly deliver to each Committed Lender a Financing
Notice notifying such Committed Lender of such Funding Date and of such
Committed Lender's ratable share of the Loans referred to therein.

                  (b)     Funding of Loans. Not later than 11:00 A.M. on the
applicable Funding Date, each Lender shall make available or instruct (followed
by diligent attention to such instruction until such time as the Agent shall
have received such Loan) its correspondent bank, if any, to make available its
share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other immediately available funds, to the
Agent at the Agent's Office. Unless the Agent determines that any applicable
condition specified in Article IV has not been satisfied, the Agent shall, by
2:30 P.M., make the amount of such Borrowing available to the Borrower at the
general deposit account in the United States designated by the Borrower in
immediately available funds in a wire transfer. In the event that the conditions
as set forth in Section 4.02 for such Loan are not


                                      -28-
<PAGE>
satisfied or waived on the applicable Funding Date, the Agent shall return to
the Lenders their respective Loans advanced pursuant to this Section 2.03.

                  A Notice of Borrowing, once delivered to the Agent, shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. Following such Notice of Borrowing, the
Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred
by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill, on or before the proposed
Funding Date specified in the Notice of Borrowing, the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02, including any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or re-employment of deposits or such funds acquired by the Lenders
to fund the Loans to be made pursuant to this Section 2.03(b). Any such loss,
cost or expense shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.07(c) after any
Lender shall have furnished to the Borrower and the Agent, with reasonable
supporting calculations, a notice specifying the amounts thereof.

                  (c)     Funding by the Agent in Anticipation of Amounts Due
from the Lenders. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to
the Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available to the Agent on the Funding Date of such
Loan in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section, and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so
made such share available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower (if and to
the extent such corresponding amount was made available by the Agent hereunder)
severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent
at (i) a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the
interest Applicable Rate, in the case of the Borrower, and (ii) the Federal
Funds Rate, in the case of such Lender. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's
Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (d)     Obligations of Lenders Several. The failure of any
Lender to make a Loan required to be made by it as part of any Borrowing
hereunder shall not relieve any other Committed Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make any Loan on the Funding Date of such Borrowing, but,
except as otherwise provided in Section 11.06(h), no Lender shall be responsible
for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other
Lender on such Funding Date.

                  (e)     Failed Loans. If any Committed Lender shall fail to
make any Loan (a "Failed Loan") which such Committed Lender is otherwise
obligated hereunder to make to the Borrower on the Funding Date of any Borrowing
and the Agent shall not have received notice from the Borrower or such Committed
Lender that any condition precedent to the making of the Failed Loan has not
been satisfied, then, until such Committed Lender shall have made or be deemed
to have made (pursuant to the last sentence of this subsection (e)) the Failed
Loan in full or the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower or such
Committed Lender that any condition precedent to the making of the Failed Loan
was not satisfied at the time the Failed Loan was to have been made, whenever
the Agent shall receive any amount from the Borrower for the account of such
Lender, (i) the amount so received (up to the amount of such Failed Loan) will,
upon receipt by the Agent, be deemed to have been paid to the Committed Lender
in satisfaction of the obligation for which paid, without actual disbursement of
such amount to the Committed Lender, (ii) the Committed Lender will be deemed to
have made the same amount available to the Agent for disbursement as a Loan to
the Borrower (up to the amount of such Failed Loan) and (iii) the Agent will
disburse such amount (up to the amount of the Failed Loan) to the Borrower


                                      -29-
<PAGE>
or, if the Agent has previously made such amount available to the Borrower on
behalf of such Committed Lender pursuant to the provisions hereof, reimburse
itself (up to the amount made available to the Borrower); provided, however,
that the Agent shall have no obligation to disburse any such amount to the
Borrower or otherwise apply it or deem it applied as provided herein unless the
Agent shall have determined in its sole discretion that to so disburse such
amount will not violate any law, rule, regulation or requirement applicable to
the Agent. Upon any such disbursement by the Agent, such Committed Lender shall
be deemed to have made a Loan to the Borrower in satisfaction, to the extent
thereof, of such Committed Lender's obligation to make the Failed Loan.

                  SECTION 2.04 EVIDENCE OF LOANS.

                  (a)      Lender Accounts. Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from
time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

                  (b)     Agent Records. The Agent shall maintain accounts in
which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount
of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from
the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received
by the Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (c)     Evidence of Debt. The entries made in the accounts
maintained pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 2.04 shall be
conclusive evidence (absent manifest error) of the existence and amounts of the
obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
or the Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance
with their terms.

                  (d)     Notes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if any Lender shall request and receive a Note or Notes as provided
in Section 11.06 or otherwise, then the Loans of such Lender shall be evidenced
by a single Note substantially in the form of Exhibit B, and payable to the
order of such Lender in an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of such Lender's Loans.

                  (e)     Note Endorsements. Each Lender having a Note shall
record the date and amount of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto, and may, if
such Lender so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of its
Note, endorse on the reverse side or on the schedule, if any, forming a part
thereof appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect
to each outstanding Loan evidenced thereby; provided that the failure of any
Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any such Note. Each Lender is
hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Note and to
attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and
when required. When the Borrower has paid a Note in full and the applicable
Lender no longer has any Commitment outstanding, such Lender will promptly
return such Note to the Agent, who will return such Note to the Borrower,
against receipt therefor, marked "PAID IN FULL".

                  (f)     Lost, Mutilated and Destroyed Notes, etc. If any Note
issued to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement shall become mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen, the Borrower shall, upon the written request of the holder of
such Note, execute and deliver to the Agent, who shall endorse and deliver to
the applicable Lender in replacement thereof a new Note, payable to the same
holder in the same principal amount and dated the same date as the Note so
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen. If the Note being replaced has become
mutilated, such Note shall be surrendered to the Borrower for cancellation and
if the Note being replaced has been destroyed, lost or stolen, the holder of
such Note shall furnish to the Borrower such indemnification as may be required
by the Borrower to hold the


                                      -30-
<PAGE>
Borrower harmless and evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower of the
destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof; provided,
however, that if the holder of such Note is a Committed Lender, the written
undertaking of such Lender shall be sufficient indemnity for purposes of this
Section 2.04(f).

                  SECTION 2.05 INTEREST.

                  (a)     Applicable Rate. Each Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during each Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate for such
day. Such interest shall be payable in arrears on each Settlement Date and on
the Final Maturity Date.

                  (b)     Determination and Notice of Interest Rates. The Agent
shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder as provided
herein. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating
Lenders of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.06 MATURITY OF LOANS. On each Interim Maturity Date,
the Borrower shall repay, and there shall become due and payable (together with
accrued interest thereon), one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the
Loans outstanding as of the Revolving Termination Date, and the Loans of each
Lender shall be ratably repaid. On the Final Maturity Date, the Borrower shall
repay, and there shall become due and payable (together with accrued interest
thereon), the aggregate principal amount of all Loans then outstanding, and the
Loans of each Lender shall be ratably repaid. For the avoidance of doubt,
principal amounts of the Loans prepaid after the Revolving Termination Date in
accordance with Section 2.07(a) or (b) below shall not reduce the amount of any
repayment scheduled to become due and payable on any Interim Maturity Date in
accordance with this Section 2.06.

                  SECTION 2.07 PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)     Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
right voluntarily to prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or
penalty; provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment of Loans shall be
in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000
in excess thereof and (ii) the Borrower shall have given prior written or
telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or telecopy
notice) to the Agent by 10:00 A.M., at least five Business Days prior to the
date of prepayment. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date
and the principal amount to be prepaid. Each notice of prepayment shall be
irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Loan by the amount
stated therein on the date stated therein. All prepayments under this Section
2.07(a) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being
prepaid to the date of payment together with any amounts owed to any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.04 hereof.

                  (b)     Mandatory Prepayments.

                          (i)     On each Settlement Date, an aggregate amount
                  equal to the amount of all Cash Flow and other amounts on
                  deposit in the Collection Account (as of the Calculation Date
                  immediately preceding such Settlement Date in the case of any
                  Settlement Date occurring prior to the Revolving Termination
                  Date) and, at the Agent's discretion (subject to Section
                  6.13(c)), the Liquidity Reserve Account shall be applied (and
                  the Loans, together with other Obligations then due, shall be
                  prepaid to the extent of cash available therefore) in
                  accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07(c)(i),
                  2.07(c)(ii) or 2.07(c)(iii), as applicable.

                          (ii)    Following the occurrence of an Event of
                  Default and acceleration of the Loans, the outstanding Loans
                  shall be paid immediately, together with accrued interest
                  thereon to the date of such prepayment, the amount, if any,
                  owed to each Lender pursuant to Section 3.04 hereof and other
                  Obligations owed hereunder.

                          (iii)   If on any Settlement Date, the Agent notifies
                  the Borrower that a Collateral Deficiency exists, the Borrower
                  shall on or prior to the next succeeding Settlement Date (or,
                  if such Collateral Deficiency exists solely as a result of an
                  exclusion of a designation by the Agent of any Designated
                  Ineligible Type of Railcar or Lease or as a result of an
                  exclusion of one or more Eligible Railcars pursuant to clause
                  (ix) of the definition of "Excluded Assets Amount", the second
                  succeeding Settlement Date) either (A) pay the amount of such
                  Collateral Deficiency together with accrued interest thereon
                  and the amount, if any, owed to each Lender pursuant to
                  Section 3.04 hereof to the Collection Account, and on the
                  following Settlement Date, or at the sole discretion of the
                  Agent upon receipt, such payment shall be applied by the Agent
                  in accordance with the then applicable provisions of Section
                  2.07(c) or (B) pledge additional Eligible Railcars and/or
                  Eligible Leases approved by the Agent in its sole discretion
                  pursuant to Section 2.02 and/or other collateral acceptable to
                  the Agent so that such Collateral Deficiency no longer exists.

                  (c)     Application of Payments and Prepayments.

                          (i)     Application of Collections During the
                  Availability Period. Subject to Section 2.07(c)(iii), so long
                  as no Manager Default or Manager Event of Default has occurred
                  and is continuing, on each Settlement Date during the
                  Availability Period, all amounts on deposit in the Collection
                  Account as of the Calculation Date immediately preceding such
                  Settlement Date and amounts which the Agent elects to apply
                  from the then current balance of the Liquidity Reserve Account
                  shall be applied by the Depositary in the following order of
                  priority:

                                  first, to the Manager, for distribution to the
                          Lessees, if any, whose payments in respect of the
                          applicable Leases are not made net of any Railroad
                          Mileage Credits due and owing to such Lessee, an
                          amount equal to the Railroad Mileage Credits due to
                          such Lessee for which an allocation has not previously
                          been made pursuant to this clause (or any
                          corresponding clause of any other subsection in this
                          Section 2.07(c)) as certified to the Agent by the
                          Manager not later than the Calculation Date

                                  second, to the payment of any fees (including
                          the Liquidity Fee and, if the Manager is not TILC or
                          one of its Affiliates, the Manager's Fee payable on

                          limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses

                          Amount") paid by a Lessee into the Collection Account

                  SECTION 2.08 ADJUSTMENT OF COMMITMENTS.

                  (a)     Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments (Pro
Rata). The Borrower may from time to time permanently reduce or terminate the
Committed Amount in whole or in part (in minimum amounts of $20,000,000 or in
integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the full
remaining amount of the then applicable Committed Amount)) upon five Business
Days' prior written or telecopy notice to the Agent, which notice shall be
irrevocable once delivered to the Agent; provided, however, no such termination
or reduction shall be made which would cause the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Loans to exceed the lesser of (i) the Committed Amount as so
reduced and (ii) the Borrowing Base at such time. The Agent shall promptly
notify each affected Lender of the receipt by the Agent of any notice from the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(a). Any partial reduction of the
Committed Amount pursuant to this Section 2.08(a) shall be applied to the
Commitments of the Committed Lenders pro-rata based upon their respective
Commitment Percentages.

                  (b)     Optional Termination of Commitments (Non-Pro-Rata). If
(i) any Lender or other Protected Party has demanded compensation or
indemnification pursuant to Section 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04, (ii) the obligation of
any Lender to fund its Loans at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate has been suspended
pursuant to Section 3.02 or (iii) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed
amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of
Section 11.01 or any other provision of any Loan Document requires the consent
of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, the Borrower shall have the
right, with the prior written consent of the Agent, to (i) remove such Lender
and all related Protected Parties by terminating the Commitment of the related
Committed Lender in full or (ii) replace such Lender and all related Protected
Parties by causing the related Committed Lender to assign its Commitment to one
or more existing Committed Lenders or Eligible Assignees pursuant to Section
11.06. The replacement of a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.08(b) shall be
effective on the tenth Business Day (the "Replacement Date") following the date
of notice of such replacement to the Lenders through the Agent, subject to the
satisfaction of the following conditions:

                          (i)     each replacement Committed Lender and/or
                  Eligible Assignee, and each Protected Party subject to
                  replacement, shall have satisfied the conditions to an
                  Assignment and Acceptance set forth in Section 11.06(b) and,
                  in connection therewith, the replacement Committed Lender(s)
                  and/or Eligible Assignee(s) shall pay to each Protected Party
                  subject to replacement an amount equal in the aggregate to the
                  sum of (A) the principal of, and all accrued but unpaid
                  interest on, its outstanding Loans and (B) all accrued but
                  unpaid fees owing to it pursuant to Section 2.09; and

                          (ii)    the Borrower shall have paid (from the
                  Discretionary Account or otherwise) to the Agent for the
                  account of each replaced Protected Party an amount equal to
                  all obligations owing to such replaced Protected Party by the
                  Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
                  Documents (other than those obligations of the Borrower
                  referred to in clause (i)(A) above).

In the case of the removal of a Protected Party pursuant to this Section
2.08(b), upon payment by the Borrower (from the Discretionary Account or
otherwise) to the Agent for the account of the Protected Party subject to such
removal of an amount equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of
all Loans held by such Protected Party and (ii) all accrued interest, fees and
other amounts owing to such Protected Party hereunder, including, without
limitation, all amounts payable by the Borrower to such Protected Party under
Article III or Sections 11.05 and 11.06, such Protected Party shall cease to
constitute a Protected Party hereunder; provided that the provisions of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of Article III and
Sections 11.05 and 11.06) shall continue to govern the rights


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
and obligations of a removed Protected Party with respect to any Loans made or
any other actions taken by such removed Protected Party while it was a
Protected Party.

                  (c)     Automatic Termination. The Commitments of the
Committed Lenders shall automatically terminate on the Revolving Termination
Date.

                  (d)     Optional Extensions of Commitments.

                          (i)     If the Borrower shall request, by notice to
                  the Agent not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days
                  prior to the Revolving Termination Date then in effect, that
                  the Availability Period be extended until the date which is
                  364 days after such Revolving Termination Date, then the Agent
                  shall promptly (but in no event later than 2 days after
                  receipt notify each Committed Lender of such request, and each
                  Committed Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Agent not
                  more than 15 Business Days after the date on which the Agent
                  shall have received the Borrower's request (which date shall
                  be set forth in the notice of such request given by the Agent)
                  of its election so to extend or not extend the Availability
                  Period. Any Committed Lender which shall not timely notify the
                  Agent of such election shall be deemed to have elected not to
                  extend such Availability Period.

                          (ii)    If one or more Committed Lenders shall timely
                  notify the Agent pursuant to clause (c)(i) of this Section
                  2.08 of its election not to extend the Availability Period or
                  shall be deemed to have elected not to extend the Availability
                  Period by virtue of having not timely notified the Agent of
                  its election to extend such Availability Period, then the
                  Agent shall so advise the Borrower and the remaining Lenders,
                  and the remaining Lenders then maintaining a Commitment or any
                  of them shall have the right (but not the obligation), upon
                  notice to the Agent not later than the Business Day
                  immediately preceding the applicable Revolving Termination
                  Date, to increase their respective Commitments by an amount
                  equal in the aggregate to the Commitments of the Committed
                  Lenders who have, or have been deemed to have, elected not to
                  extend the Availability Period. Each Lender electing to
                  increase its Commitment hereunder shall specify in its notice
                  to the Agent the amount by which it is willing to increase its
                  Commitment; provided that if the aggregate amount of proposed
                  increases by all remaining Lenders shall equal or exceed the
                  aggregate Commitments of those Lenders who have, or have been
                  deemed to have, elected not to extend the Availability Period,
                  the amount of any increase in Commitments shall not exceed for
                  any Lender the product of (A) the quotient of (x) such
                  Lender's Commitment divided by (y) the aggregate Commitments
                  of all the remaining Lenders (in each case determined before
                  giving effect to any increase in the Commitments of the
                  remaining Lenders pursuant to this subsection (c)) multiplied
                  by (B) the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders who have, or
                  have been deemed to have, elected not to extend the
                  Availability Period. Each increase in the Commitment of a
                  Lender hereunder shall be evidenced by a written instrument
                  executed by such Lender and the Agent and shall take effect on
                  the Revolving Termination Date in effect for the Lenders who
                  have, or have been deemed to have, elected not to extend the
                  Availability Period.

                          (iii)   If the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders
                  shall exceed the aggregate amount by which the remaining
                  Lenders have agreed to increase their Commitments pursuant to
                  subsection (c)(ii) of this Section 2.08, the Borrower may,
                  with the approval of the Agent, designate one or more Eligible
                  Assignees willing to extend Commitments until the date which
                  is 364 days after the Revolving Termination Date in effect for
                  the Lenders who have, or have been deemed to have, elected not
                  to extend the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not
                  greater than such excess. Any such Eligible Assignee shall, on
                  or prior to the Revolving Termination Date in effect for the
                  Lenders who have, or have been deemed to have, elected not to
                  extend the Availability Period, execute and deliver to the
                  Borrower, the Agent and each remaining Lender an


                                      -38-
<PAGE>
                  instrument, satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent,
                  setting forth the amount of its Commitment and containing its
                  agreement to become, and to perform all the obligations of, a
                  Lender hereunder. The Commitment of such Eligible Assignee
                  shall become effective, and such Eligible Assignee shall
                  become a Committed Lender hereunder, on the Revolving
                  Termination Date then in effect for the Lenders who have, or
                  have been deemed to have, elected not to extend the
                  Availability Period.

                          (iv)    The Borrower shall deliver to each Eligible
                  Assignee (upon request of such Eligible Assignee), on the
                  Revolving Termination Date in effect for the Lenders who have,
                  or have been deemed to have, elected not to extend the
                  Availability Period, a Note evidencing the Borrower's
                  obligation to pay Loans made by such Eligible Assignee
                  pursuant to this Agreement.

                          (v)     If, after giving effect to any increase in the
                  Commitments of one or more remaining Lenders pursuant to
                  clause (ii) above and any assignments to or new of one or
                  more Eligible Assignees pursuant to  (iii) above, the
                  extension of the Period as provided in this Section 2.08(c)
                  shall have been approved by Lenders holding Commitments equal
                  in the aggregate to 100% of the Committed, then the
                  Availability Period shall not be extended but continue in
                  effect until the Revolving Termination Date and shall then
                  terminate. If Lenders holding Commitments equal in the
                  aggregate to 100% of the Committed Amount shall have elected
                  to extend the Availability Period as provided in this Section
                  2.08(c), then (A) the Availability Period with respect to the
                  Commitments of such Lenders and any which becomes a Lender
                  hereunder shall continue until the date which is 364 days
                  after the Revolving Termination Date in effect prior to such
                  election and, as to such Lenders, the term "Revolving
                  Termination Date", as used herein, shall mean such 364th day;
                  (B) the Commitments of the Lenders who have, or have been
                  deemed to have, elected not to extend the Availability Period
                  shall continue in effect until the Revolving Termination Date
                  in effect prior to such extension and shall then terminate,
                  and, as to such Lenders, the term "Revolving Termination
                  Date", as used herein, shall continue to mean such Revolving
                  Termination Date; and (C) on the Revolving Date in effect
                  prior to such extension, each who has, or has been deemed to
                  have, elected not to the Availability Period shall cease to be
                  a Lender hereunder; provided that the provisions of this
                  Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of
                  Article III and Sections 11.04 and 11.05) shall continue to
                  govern the rights and obligations of such Lender with respect
                  to any Loans made.

                  SECTION 2.09 FEES.

                  (a)     Liquidity Fee. On each Settlement Date, the Borrower
shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Committed Lender a fee (the
"Liquidity Fee") on such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the daily average
Unused Committed Amount for the Measuring Period ended most recently prior to
such Settlement Date, computed at a per annum rate for each day at a rate equal
to 40 basis points. The Liquidity Fee shall commence to accrue on the Closing
Date and shall be due and payable in arrears on each Settlement Date for the
Measuring Period ending most recently prior to such date, beginning with the
first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date.

                  (b)     Fee Letter. On each Settlement Date, the Borrower
shall pay the Agent for its account such fee or fees as shall be payable at such
time in accordance with the Fee Letter.

                  SECTION 2.10 PRO-RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent
otherwise provided herein, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of
principal of or interest on any Loan, each payment of fees, each reduction of
the Committed Amount and each conversion or continuation of any Loan, shall be
allocated pro-rata among the relevant Lenders in accordance with the respective
Commitment Percentages


                                      -39-
<PAGE>
of such Lenders (or, if the Commitments of such Lenders have expired or been
terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the
outstanding Loans of such Lenders); provided that, in the event any amount paid
to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the Agent, each Lender shall, upon the request of the Agent, repay
to the Agent the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the period
commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Agent until the date the
Agent receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period
to but excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal
Funds Rate, and thereafter, the Corporate Base Rate plus two percent per annum.

                  SECTION 2.11 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. The Lenders agree among
themselves that, except to the extent otherwise provided herein, if any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to
such Lender under this Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff,
banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506
of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess
of its pro-rata share of such payment as provided for in this Agreement, such
Lender shall promptly pay in cash or purchase from the other Lenders a
participation in such Loans and other obligations in such amounts, and make such
other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all
Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves that
if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right
of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be
rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the
benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a repurchase of a
participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with
its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender
whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff,
banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such
participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this
Section 2.11 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its
rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights
of the Lenders under this Section 2.11 to share in the benefits of any recovery
on such secured claim.

                  SECTION 2.12 PAYMENTS; COMPUTATIONS.

                  (a)     Payments by the Borrower. Each payment of principal of
and interest on Loans and fees hereunder shall be paid not later than 11:00 A.M.
on the date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available to the
Agent at the Collection Account. Each such payment shall be made irrespective of
any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which might in the absence of
this provision be asserted by the Borrower or any Affiliate against the Agent or
any Lender. Payments received after 2:00 P.M. (unless such failure to receive
payment is solely caused by failure of the Depository to timely remit payments
in accordance with the Depositary Agreement and such failure is cured and all
amounts required to be dispersed to the Lenders on such Settlement Date are so
disbursed on the applicable payment dates) shall be deemed to have been received
on the next Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payments
under this Agreement, specify to the Agent the Loan, fees or other amounts
payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and if
it fails to specify or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms
hereof, the Agent shall, subject to Section 2.10, distribute such payment to the
Lenders in such manner as the Agent may deem appropriate in accordance with
Section 2.07(c)). The Agent will distribute such payments to the applicable
Lenders on the date of receipt thereof, if such payment is received prior to
2:00 P.M. (unless such failure to receive payment is solely caused by failure of
the Depository to timely remit payments in


                                      -40-
<PAGE>
accordance with the Depositary Agreement and such failure is cured and all
amounts required to be dispersed to the Lenders on such Settlement Date are so
disbursed on the applicable payment dates); otherwise the Agent will distribute
such payment to the applicable Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day.
Whenever any payment hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a Business
Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation
of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
The Borrower hereby authorizes and directs the Agent to debit any account
maintained by the Borrower with the Agent to pay when due any amounts required
to be paid from time to time under this Agreement.

                  (b)     Distributions by the Agent. Unless the Agent shall
have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is
due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in
full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to
the Agent on such date, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not
have so made such payment, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for
the first three Business Days after demand by the Agent and at the Applicable
Rate thereafter until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent.

                  (c)     Computations. All computations of interest and fees
hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a
year of 360 days. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing
but exclude the date of payment.

                                  ARTICLE III
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

                  SECTION 3.01 TAXES.

                  (a)     Payments Net of Certain Taxes. Any and all payments by
the Borrower to or for the account of any Protected Party hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in
the case of each Protected Party, taxes imposed on its net income, and
franchise, branch profits, capital or net worth taxes imposed on it, in each
case by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Protected Party is
organized or has an office or place of business, other than solely on account of
being a party to, receiving a payment or income under, or enforcing, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any political subdivision thereof (all
such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to
any Protected Party, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) such
Protected Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and
withholdings, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
Applicable Law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at the Agent's
Office, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.

                  (b)     Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay
any and all present or future stamp or documentary, excise or property taxes or
similar levies which arise from any payment


                                      -41-
<PAGE>
made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or from the execution or
delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c)     Additional Taxes. The Borrower agrees to indemnify
each Protected Party for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section 3.01) paid by such Protected Party and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto.

                  (d)     Tax Forms and Certificates. Each Lender organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (a "Non-U.S. Lender")
shall , on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement
in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages thereof and on or prior
to the date on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and
from time to time thereafter as required by law on or prior to the expiration of
the form or certificate most recently provided, provide the Borrower and the
Agent with true, complete and correct (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN
or W-8 ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces to zero
the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the
income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) any other form or
certificate required by any United States taxing authority (including any
certificate required by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue
Code), certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
Additionally, if a Lender or Protected Party sells, assigns or transfers any
participation in a Loan to another Person, such Lender or Protected Party shall
provide any new forms required as a result of such sale or transfer (including,
if necessary, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY).

                  (e)     Failure to Provide Tax Forms and Certificates. For any
period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Borrower and the
Agent with the appropriate form or certificate in the manner and as prescribed
by Section 3.01(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or
regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
required to be provided), neither such Lender nor any related Protected Party
shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 3.01(a) or 3.01(b) with
respect to Taxes imposed by the United States or any political subdivision
therein as a result of such failure; provided, however, that should a Protected
Party, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of
withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its or any related Lender's
failure to deliver a form required to be delivered hereunder, the Borrower shall
take such steps as such Lender or Protected Party shall reasonably request at
such Protected Party's cost to assist such Protected Party to recover such
Taxes.

                  (f)     Obligations in Respect of Non-U.S. Lenders. The
Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender or related
Protected Party or to pay any additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender or
related Protected Party, in respect of United States Federal withholding tax
pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) above to the extent that the obligation to
withhold amounts with respect to United States Federal withholding tax existed
on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the
case of a participant, on the date such participant acquired its participation
interest) or to the extent such obligation to withhold amounts with respect to
United States federal withholding tax arises after such date as a result of a
change in residence, place of incorporation, principal place of business, or
office or location in which Loans governed by


                                      -42-
<PAGE>
this Agreement are booked or recorded by such Lender or Protected Party;
provided, however, that this subsection (f) shall not apply (i) to any
participant that becomes a participant as a result of an assignment,
participation, transfer or designation made at the request of the Borrower or
where a change of office or location in which Loans governed by this Agreement
are booked or recorded is made at the request of the Borrower and (ii) to the
extent the indemnity payment or additional amounts any participant would be
entitled to receive (without regard to this subsection (f)) do not exceed the
indemnity payment or additional amounts that the Person making the assignment,
participation or transfer to such participant would have been entitled to
receive in the absence of such assignment, participation, transfer or
designation.

                  (g)     Mitigation. If the Borrower is required to pay
additional amounts to or for the account of any Protected Party pursuant to this
Section 3.01, then such Protected Party will agree to use reasonable efforts to
eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if
such change, in the judgment of such Protected Party, is not otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (h)     Tax Receipts. Within thirty days after the date of any
payment of Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment (to the extent one is so
provided).

                  (i)     Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any
other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrower contained in subsections (a) through (h) above shall survive the
payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under any instrument
delivered hereunder.

                  SECTION 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable
Law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund any of its Loans at a rate
based upon the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (such event being hereinafter referred
to as an "Illegality Event") and such Lender shall so notify the Agent, the
Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrower,
whereupon until such Lender notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, interest on the
Loans of such Lender shall accrue and be payable at the Corporate Base Rate. If
an Illegality Event does not affect all Lenders, the Agent shall make a good
faith effort to cause the Lenders that are not affected by such Illegality Event
to purchase the Loans held by the affected Lenders. The foregoing shall not
delay or otherwise affect the Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the
Corporate Base Rate as provided in this paragraph.

                  SECTION 3.03 INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCED RETURN. (a) If, on or
after the date hereof, the adoption of or any change in any Applicable Law or in
the interpretation or application thereof applicable to any Protected Party, or
compliance by any Protected Party with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority,
in each case made subsequent to the Effective Date (or, if later, the date on
which such Protected Party becomes a Protected Party):

                          (i)     shall subject such Protected Party to any tax
                  of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Loans made by it or
                  its Note or its obligation to make Loans, or change the basis
                  of taxation of payments to such Protected Party in respect
                  thereof (except for (A) Taxes and Other Taxes covered by
                  Section 3.01 and (B) changes in taxes measured by or imposed
                  upon the net income or franchise tax (imposed in lieu of such
                  net income tax), of such Protected Party or any Affiliate
                  thereof));

                          (ii)    shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
                  requirement against assets held by, deposits or other
                  liabilities in or


                                      -43-
<PAGE>
                  for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of
                  credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of
                  such Protected Party which is not otherwise included in the
                  determination of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate hereunder; or

                          (iii)   shall impose on such Protected Party any other
                  condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Protected
Party of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining any Loans or to
reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof (any such increased
cost or reduction hereinafter referred to as an "Increased Cost"), then, in any
such case, upon notice to the Borrower from such Protected Party, through the
Agent, in accordance herewith, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay such
Protected Party, in accordance with Section 2.07(c), any additional amounts
necessary to compensate such Protected Party on an after-tax basis (after taking
into account applicable deductions and credits in respect of the amount
indemnified) for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

                  (b)     If any Protected Party shall have determined that the
adoption or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any Applicable Law, regarding capital adequacy, or compliance by such
Protected Party, or its parent corporation, with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Protected Party's (or parent corporation's)
capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder
to a level below that which such Protected Party, or its parent corporation,
could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Protected Party's (or parent corporation's)
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such
Protected Party to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such
Protected Party in accordance with Section 2.07(c), such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Protected Party on an after-tax basis (after
taking into account applicable deductions and credits in respect of the amount
indemnified) for such reduction. Each determination by any such Protected Party
of amounts owing under this Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive
and binding on the parties hereto.

                  (c)     A certificate of each Protected Party setting forth
such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Protected Party
or its holding company as specified in subsection (a) or (b) above, as the case
may be, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay each Protected Party the amount shown as
due on any such certificate delivered by it on the next succeeding Settlement
Date in accordance with Section 2.07(c).

                  (d)     Promptly after any Protected Party becomes aware of
any circumstance that will, in its sole judgment, result in a request for
increased compensation pursuant to this Section, such Protected Party shall
notify the Borrower thereof. Failure on the part of any Protected Party so to
notify the Borrower or to demand compensation for any increased costs or
reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital
with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Protected
Party's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any other
period. The protection of this Section shall be available to each Protected
Party regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability
of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall
have occurred or been imposed.

                  SECTION 3.04 FUNDING LOSSES. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Protected Party against any loss or reasonable expense (but excluding in any
event loss of anticipated profit) which such Protected Party may sustain or
incur as a consequence of (i) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the


                                      -44-
<PAGE>
date of any Borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article
IV, so long as any such failure is not solely due to the failure of the Agent
or any Lender to comply with its obligations hereunder in all material
respects, (ii) any failure by the Borrower to borrow or to refinance any Loan
hereunder after irrevocable notice of such Borrowing, or refinancing has been
given pursuant to Section 2.02 or 2.07, so long as any such failure is not
solely due to the failure of the Agent or any Lender to comply with its
obligations hereunder in all material respects or (iii) any payment or
prepayment of a Loan, whether voluntary or involuntary, pursuant to any other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise made on a date other than the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, so long as any such payment,
prepayment or conversion is not solely due to the failure of the Agent or any
Lender to comply with its obligations hereunder in all material respects. Such
loss or reasonable expense shall be determined by each Protected Party in its
sole discretion and shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, as
reasonably determined by such Protected Party, of (i) its cost of obtaining the
funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid or not borrowed (based on the applicable
London Interbank Offered Rate), for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment or failure to borrow to the last day of the then applicable Interest
Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such
Loan which would have been applicable to such Loan on the date of such failure
to borrow) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such
Protected Party) that would be realized by such Protected Party in reemploying
the funds so paid, prepaid or not borrowed or continued for such period or
Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Protected Party
setting forth any amount or amounts which such Protected Party is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  Each Facility Party represents and warrants that:

approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly
qualified as a foreign trust, licensed and in good standing in each
jurisdiction where qualification or licensing is required by the nature of its
business or the character and location of its property, business or customers

formation, has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now

Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.02 POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS.
Each Facility Party has the corporate or other necessary power and authority,
and the legal right to execute, deliver and perform the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to obtain extensions of
credit hereunder, and has taken all necessary corporate or other action to
authorize the borrowings and other actions on the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. No consent, approval, licenses,
validation or authorization of, filing, recording or registration with, notice
to, exemption by or other similar act by or in respect of, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person (including, without limitation, any stockholder,
certificateholder or creditor of any Facility Party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) is required to be obtained or made by or on behalf of any Facility
Party in connection with the borrowings or other extensions of credit hereunder,
the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability by or against
it of the Transaction Documents or the exercise of the rights and remedies of
the Agent or any Protected Party pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, except for (i) consents, authorizations, notices and filings disclosed
in Schedule 5.02, all of which have been obtained or made, (ii) filings to
perfect and maintain the perfection of the Liens created by the Collateral

with the disposal of Collateral required by laws affecting the offering and sale
of securities. This Agreement has been, and each other Transaction Document to
which any Facility Party is a party will be, duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Person. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Transaction
Document to which any Facility Party is a party when executed and delivered will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Facility Party party
thereto, enforceable against such Person in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles of general applicability
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at
law).

                  SECTION 5.03 NO CONFLICTS. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Facility Parties of the Transaction Documents to which each is a party,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor performance

(i) violate or conflict with any provision of the Organization Documents of any
Facility Party, (ii) violate, contravene or conflict with any Applicable Law
(including Regulation U or Regulation X), (iii) violate, contravene or conflict
with any Contractual Obligation to which any Facility Party is a party or by
which any Facility Party may be bound, or (iv) result in or require the creation
of any Lien (other than the Lien of the Collateral Documents) upon or with
respect to the properties of any Facility Party.

                  SECTION 5.04 NO DEFAULT. No Facility Party is in default in
any respect under any Contractual Obligation to which it is a party or by which
any of its properties is bound, in each case which default has had or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default, Manager
Default, Manager Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

                  SECTION 5.05 FINANCIAL CONDITION.

                  (a)     Audited Financial Statements. The consolidated balance
sheet of each of Trinity and TILC and their respective consolidated Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2001 and the related consolidated and consolidating
statements of income and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, reported on
by Ernst & Young LLP, copies of which have been delivered to each of the
Lenders, fairly present, in conformity with GAAP, the consolidated financial
position of each of Trinity and TILC and their respective consolidated
Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for such fiscal year.

                  (b)     Interim Financial Statements. The unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of each of Trinity and TILC and their respective
consolidated Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002 and the related unaudited
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three months then
ended, copies of which have been delivered to each of the Lenders, fairly
present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
financial statements referred to in subsection (a) of this Section, the
consolidated financial position of each of Trinity and TILC and their respective
consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for such three-month period (subject to normal

including the Closing Date, there has been no sale, transfer or other
disposition by Trinity or TILC or any of their respective consolidated
Subsidiaries of any material part of the business or property of Trinity or TILC
and their respective consolidated Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole,
and no purchase or other acquisition by them of any business or property
(including any Equity Interests of any other Person) material in relation to the
consolidated financial condition of Trinity or TILC and their respective
consolidated Subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, which is not
reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto. The
balance sheets and the notes thereto included in the financial statements
referred to in this subsection (b) and in subsection (a) above disclose all
liabilities, actual or contingent, of Trinity or TILC and their respective
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date thereof required to be disclosed
therein in accordance with GAAP.

                  (c)     Post-Closing Financial Statements. The financial
statements to be delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 6.01(a) and (b),
if any, (i) will have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may
otherwise be permitted under Section 6.01(a) and (b)) and (ii) will present
fairly (on the basis disclosed in the footnotes to such financial statements, if
any) the consolidated and consolidating financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of each of Trinity and TILC and their respective
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods covered thereby.

                  (d)     No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in the
financial statements described in subsections (a) and (b) above, the Debt
incurred under this Agreement and the Debt incurred under the Bank Credit
Facility, (i) there were as of the Closing Date (and after giving effect to any
Loans made on such date), no liabilities or obligations (excluding current
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business) with respect to Trinity
or any Facility Party of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due and including obligations or
liabilities for taxes, long-term leases and unusual forward or other long-term
commitments), and (ii) no Facility Party knows of any basis for the assertion
against Trinity or any Facility Party of any such liability or obligation which,
either individually or in the aggregate, are or could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.06 NO MATERIAL CHANGE. Since December 31, 2001 there
has been no Material Adverse Effect, and no event or development has occurred
which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.


                                      -53-
<PAGE>
                  SECTION 5.07 TITLE TO PROPERTIES. On the Closing Date and
during the term of this Agreement, the Borrower shall be the sole legal and
beneficial owner of and shall have good and marketable title to each Portfolio
Railcar and Portfolio Lease and all of its other material properties and assets,
except, in the case of assets other than Portfolio Railcars and Portfolio
Leases, for minor defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to
conduct its business as currently conducted. All such Portfolio Railcars and
Portfolio Leases and other material properties and assets are and will be free
and clear of Liens other than Permitted Liens.

                  SECTION 5.08 LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits,
investigations or legal, equitable, arbitration or administrative proceedings
pending or overtly threatened (or any basis therefor known to any Facility
Party) against or affecting any Facility Party, either Partner or the
Partnership that (i) involve any Transaction Document or (ii) could reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 5.09 TAXES. Each Facility Party, each Partner or the
Partnership have filed, or caused to be filed, all tax returns (including
federal, state, local and foreign tax returns) the failure of which to be filed
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and paid (i)
all amounts of taxes shown thereon to be due (including interest and penalties)
and (ii) all other material taxes, fees, assessments and other governmental
charges (including mortgage recording taxes, documentary stamp taxes and
intangible taxes) owing by it, except for such taxes (A) which are not yet
delinquent or (B) that are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings diligently pursued, and against which adequate reserves are being
maintained in accordance with GAAP. No Facility Party knows of any pending
investigation of any Facility Party, either Partner or the Partnership by any
taxing authority or proposed tax assessments against any Facility Party, either
Partner or the Partnership.

                  SECTION 5.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each Facility Party is in
compliance with all requirements of Applicable Law (including Environmental
Laws) applicable to it or to its properties, except where such failures to
comply could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither any Facility Party nor any of their
respective material properties or assets is subject to or in default with
respect to any judgment, writ, injunction, decree or order of any court or other
Governmental Authority, except where such defaults could not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Facility Party has received any written communication from any
Governmental Authority that alleges that any of them is not in compliance in any
material respect with any Applicable Law, except for allegations that have been
satisfactorily resolved and are no longer outstanding.

                  SECTION 5.11 ERISA.

                  (a)     Each Pension Plan is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable
Laws. Each Pension Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or an
application for such a letter is currently being processed by the IRS with
respect thereto and, to the best knowledge of the Facility Parties, nothing has
occurred which would prevent, or cause the loss of such qualification. The
Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made all required contributions to each
Pension Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, and no application for a
funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period pursuant to Section
412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Pension Plan.

                  (b)     There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Facility Parties, threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any
Governmental Authority, with respect to any Pension Plan that could be
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no
prohibited


                                      -54-
<PAGE>
transaction or violation of the fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to
any Pension Plan that has resulted or could be reasonably expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)     (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur; (ii) no Pension Plan has any Unfunded Pension Liability;
(iii) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably
expects to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any
Pension Plan (other than premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of
ERISA); (iv) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or
reasonably expects to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which,
with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such
liability) under Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer
Plan; and (v) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a
transaction that could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

                  SECTION 5.12 SUBSIDIARIES. The Borrower has no Subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 5.13 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, ETC. (a) The Borrower
is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying "margin
stock" within the meaning of Regulation U. No proceeds of the Loans will be
used, directly, or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
"margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U. If requested by any Lender or
the Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent and each Lender a statement to
the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred
to in Regulation U. "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not
constitute more than 25% of the value of the assets of the Borrower. None of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the direct or indirect
use of the proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the
Securities Act, as amended, the Exchange Act or regulations issued pursuant
thereto, or Regulation T, U or X.

                  (b)     The Borrower is not subject to regulation under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the
Investment Company Act of 1940, each as amended. In addition, the Borrower is
not (i) an "investment company" registered or required to be registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (ii) controlled by such a
company, or (iii) a "holding company", a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a
"holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.

                  (c)     No director, executive officer or principal holder of
any Equity Interest of any Facility Party is a director, executive officer or
principal shareholder of any Lender. For the purposes hereof, the terms
"director", "executive officer" and "principal shareholder" (when used with
reference to any Lender) have the respective meanings assigned thereto in
Regulation O.

                  SECTION 5.14 PURPOSE OF LOANS. The proceeds of the Loans made
on each Funding Date will be used solely to fund the Purchase Price of Eligible
Railcars and related Eligible Leases added to the Portfolio on such Funding Date
and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.

                  SECTION 5.15 LABOR MATTERS. There are no strikes against any
Facility Party, other than any strikes that, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
hours worked and payments made to employees of each Facility Party have not been
in violation in any material respect of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable law dealing with such matters. All payments due from any
Facility Party, or for which any claim may be made against any Facility Party,
on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits
have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the applicable Facility
Party. The


                                      -55-
<PAGE>
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
and/or Lease Documents will not give rise to a right of termination or right of
renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining
agreement to which each Facility Party is a party or by which it (or any
predecessor) is bound, other than collective bargaining agreements which,
individually or in the aggregate, are not material to any Facility Party.

                  SECTION 5.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Each Facility Party has
complied in all respects with all applicable federal, state, local and regional
statutes, ordinances, orders, judgments, rulings and regulations relating to any
matters of pollution or of environmental regulation or control, except where the
failure to comply could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Facility Party has
received written notice of any actual or claimed or asserted failure so to
comply which alone, or together with any other such notices which have been
previously or concurrently received, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, other than in connection with failures which have been
corrected. No hazardous wastes, hazardous substances, hazardous materials, toxic
substances or toxic pollutants, as those terms are used in the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the
Toxic Substance Control Act, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, are
managed on any property of any Facility Party in violation of any regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto or any other Applicable Law, except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.17 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each Facility Party owns,
or possesses the right to use, all of the Marks, trademarks, service marks,
trade names, copyrights, patents, patent rights, franchises, licenses and other
rights that are reasonably necessary for the operation of its business, without
conflict with the rights of any other Person. To the best knowledge of the
Facility Parties, no slogan or other advertising devise, product, process,
method, substance, part or other material now employed, or now contemplated to
be employed, by any Facility Party infringes upon any rights held by any other
Person. No claim or litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending or

Documents), all credits granted thereon, all merchandise returned and all other
dealings therewith, and the Borrower will make the same available to the Agent

Party will pay and discharge (i) all material taxes, assessments and other
governmental charges or levies imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits,
or upon any of its properties, before they shall become delinquent, (ii) all
lawful claims (including claims for labor, materials and supplies) which, if
unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon any of the Collateral and (iii) all of
its other Debt as it shall become due; provided, however, that no Facility Party
shall be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy, claim or Debt
which is being contested or negotiated in good faith by appropriate proceedings
diligently pursued and as to which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP, unless the failure to make any such payment could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 6.06 INSURANCE; CERTAIN PROCEEDS. (a) The Borrower
will at all times maintain in full force and effect insurance in such amounts,
covering such risk and liabilities and with such deductibles or self-insurance
retentions as are in accordance with normal industry practice (or as are
otherwise required by the Collateral Documents), and in any event in compliance
with the requirements of Schedule 6.06 hereof. Notwithstanding the generality of
the foregoing, (i) with respect to any Portfolio


                                      -61-
<PAGE>
Railcar subject to a Lease, the Borrower agrees that it (or the Manager acting
on its behalf) shall enforce the provisions of the Lease against the applicable
Lessee as to all required insurance pursuant to the terms thereof, and (ii)
with respect to any Portfolio Railcar not subject to a Lease, in addition to
its covenants with respect to the Collateral described herein, the Borrower
shall comply with the provisions of the Management Documents regarding
insurance for the Railcar. The Agent shall be named as loss payee or mortgagee,
as its interest may appear, with respect to all such property and casualty
policies and additional insured with respect to all such other policies (other
than workers' compensation and employee health policies, if any), and each
provider of any such insurance shall agree, by endorsement upon the policy or
policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to the Agent, (i)
that the insurance carrier shall pay all proceeds otherwise payable to the
Borrower under such policies directly to the Agent or its nominee (which
agreement shall be evidenced by a "standard" or "New York" lender's loss
payable endorsement in the name of the Agent on Accord Form 27), (ii) to waive
all claims for insurance premiums against the Agent and the Secured Parties (as
defined in the Security Agreement), (iii) to provide coverage to the Agent for
the benefit of the Secured Parties regardless of the breach by the Borrower of
any warranty or representation made therein, (iv) that no such policy is
subject to co-insurance, (v) that it will give the Agent thirty days' prior
written notice before any such policy or policies shall be materially altered,
terminated or canceled, and that no act or default of any Facility Party or any
other Person (other than non-payment of premiums) shall affect the rights of
the Agent or the Lenders under such policy or policies and (vi) that it will
accept payment or other performance by the Agent (which payment or performance
may be tendered in the discretion of the Agent but shall not be required)
following a default by the Borrower or by the Manager acting on its behalf. The
Borrower assumes all liability and responsibility in connection with the
Portfolio and other property and assets acquired by it and the liability of the
Borrower to pay the Obligations shall in no way be affected or diminished by
reason of the fact that any such property may be lost, destroyed, stolen,
damaged or for any reason whatsoever unavailable to the Borrower.

                  (b)     Any cash receipts from an Event of Loss, Casualty or
Condemnation (whether by way of Casualty Proceeds or Lessee indemnity payments
or otherwise) shall be paid directly to the Depositary for deposit to the
Collection Account and, subject to Section 2.07(c)(iii), applied pursuant to
Section 2.07(c)(i) or Section 2.07(c)(ii), as applicable (except for Excepted
Payments, which shall be payable to the Persons for whose benefit any such
payment is made). The Agent shall pay to the Depositary for deposit and
application pursuant to the Depository Agreement all Casualty Proceeds from time
to time received by the Agent in respect of occurrences not constituting an
Event of Loss with respect to the applicable Portfolio Railcar.

                  Upon the request of the Agent from time to time, the Borrower
will promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further instruments
and documents as may be specified in such request which are reasonably necessary
to perfect, preserve or protect the security interests created or intended to be
created for the Replacement Railcars referred to herein, or to establish that
the Borrower has title to such Railcars.

                  (c)     The Borrower shall not operate any Portfolio Railcar
or suffer any Portfolio Railcar to be operated in violation of any provision of
any insurance policy in effect with respect to such Railcar or in any
jurisdiction where all of the insurance required hereunder shall not remain in
full force and effect or in violation of any law, treaty, statute, rule,
directive, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over such Portfolio Railcar or in violation of any applicable certificate,
license or registration relating to such Portfolio Railcar issued by any such
Governmental Authority.

                  (d)     In connection with the covenants set forth in this
Section 6.06, it is understood and agreed that:

                  damage insured by the insurance policies required to be
                  maintained under this Section 6.06, it being understood that
                  (A) the Borrower shall look solely to its insurance companies
                  or any other parties other than the aforesaid parties for the
                  recovery of such loss or damage and (B) such insurance
                  companies shall have no rights of subrogation against the
                  Agent, the Lenders or their agents or employees; provided,
                  however, that if the insurance policies do not provide waiver
                  of subrogation rights against such parties, as required above,
                  then the Borrower hereby agrees to waive its right of
                  recovery, if any, against the Agent, the Lenders and their
                  agents and employees, to the extent permitted by law;

                          (ii)    the Borrower will permit an insurance
                  consultant retained by the Agent, at the expense of the
                  Borrower, to review from time to time the insurance policies
                  maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower annually or upon
                  the occurrence of an Event of Default; and

                          (iii)     the Required Lenders shall have the right
                  from time to time to require the Borrower to keep other
                  insurance in such form and amount as the Agent or the Required
                  Lenders may reasonably request; provided that such insurance
                  shall be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms; and
                  provided, further, that the designation of any form, type or
                  amount of insurance coverage by the Agent or the Required
                  Lenders under this Section 6.06 shall in no event be deemed a
                  representation, warranty or advice by the Agent or the Lenders
                  that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of the
                  business of the Borrower or the protection of its properties.

                  SECTION 6.07 OPERATION, USE AND MAINTENANCE.

                  (a)     Operation and Use. The Borrower will and will require
each Lessee to use the Portfolio Railcars only for lawful purposes and shall use
and operate and require each Lessee to use and operate the Portfolio Railcars in
compliance in all material respects with Applicable Law, except for so long as
the Borrower or a Lessee is contesting in good faith by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted the validity or application of such Applicable Law in any
reasonable manner. The Portfolio Railcars may not be located or used in any
country other than the United States, Canada or Mexico.

                  (b)     Maintenance. The Borrower will and will require each
Lessee to keep, repair and maintain the Portfolio Railcars (i) in good order and
operating condition according to industry practice for Railcars of similar age
and vintage, ordinary wear and tear excepted, (ii) in compliance in all material
respects with Applicable Law, except for so long as the Borrower or a Lessee is
contesting in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted the
validity or application of such Applicable Law in any reasonable manner, (iii)
suitable for use in interchange in accordance with the Interchange Rules and
(iv) at least as well in all material respects as it would for other similar
equipment owned or operated by the Borrower. In addition to (but without
limitation of) the foregoing obligation of the Borrower,

                          (i)     with respect to any Portfolio Railcar subject
                  to a Lease, the Borrower will use reasonable commercial
                  efforts to cause the Lessee of such Railcar to comply with the
                  maintenance requirements set forth in such Lease, and

                          (ii)    with respect to any Portfolio Railcar not
                  subject to a Lease, the Borrower will cause the Railcar to
                  comply with the maintenance requirements set forth in the
                  Management Agreement.

                  (c)     Identification Numbers. The Borrower may change or
permit to be changed the identifying number of any Portfolio Railcar in

Monthly Report or promptly upon request of the Agent if there exists an Event of
Default, the Borrower (or the Manager on its behalf) shall deliver to the Agent
a list of the identifying numbers of all Portfolio Railcars that have been
changed within the period covered by such Monthly Report and prior thereto to

lettered with the names, trademarks, initials or other insignia customarily used
by the Borrower or its Affiliates (including the Marks Company), or any Lessee
or its Affiliates, on railroad equipment used or leased by such Person of the
same or a similar type for convenience of identification of its right to use
such Portfolio Railcar under any applicable Lease, and any of the Portfolio
Railcars may be lettered in an appropriate manner for convenience of
identification of the interest of the Borrower or any Lessee therein.

any Lessee to replace, all Parts with respect to Portfolio Railcars that may
from time to time become worn out, obsolete, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any
reason whatsoever. In addition, in the course of maintenance, service, repair,
overhaul or testing, the Borrower or a Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, may
remove any Part, whether or not worn out, obsolete, lost, stolen, destroyed,
seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for
use. All replacement Parts shall be selected and installed in accordance with
the Borrower's or the Manager's normal business practices at that time applied
in a nondiscriminatory manner, and shall be free and clear of all Liens except
Permitted Liens and shall be in good operating condition.

                  (b)     Modifications and Improvements. The Borrower, at its
expense (whether from the Modification and Improvement Account, by reimbursement

Section 2.07(c) or otherwise), shall make or cause to be made such modifications
and improvements to each Portfolio Railcar: (i) to the extent required of the
Borrower by the terms of the applicable Lease or (ii) as may be (A) set forth as
requiring present compliance in any mandatory directives adopted by any
Governmental Authority or (B) required from time to time to meet the applicable
standards of the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over it or the
appropriate Railcar or the standards of any applicable maintenance program,
unless the validity of such standard is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings.

                  (c)     Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.08, the
Borrower shall not make or permit to be made any modifications and improvements

subject to the provisions of Section 6.10(b) below, in the case of Railcars the

procedures on inspection of the Portfolio Railcars in any applicable Lease,
conduct a physical inspection of any Portfolio Railcar or otherwise obtain a
Physical Inspection Report with respect thereto at any time after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and the Borrower will pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such professionals in accordance with Section
11.04. In addition to the foregoing, the Borrower agrees that (i) not later than
the 60th day after the Closing Date, the Borrower will deliver to the Agent a
Physical Inspection Report with respect to a representative sampling of not less
than five percent and up to ten percent of the Railcars intended to become
Portfolio Railcars on the Closing Date and (ii) thereafter, (A) a copy of any
Physical Inspection Report obtained by the Borrower (or by the Manager on its
behalf) with respect to any Portfolio Railcar or proposed Portfolio Railcar and
(B) in the event the Borrower acquires a group of Railcars from a seller other
than the relevant Manufacturer thereof, a Physical Inspection Report with
respect to a representative sampling of 10% or such higher percentage of such
group of Railcars as may be agreed by the Borrower and the Agent.

                  (b) Appraisals. (i) At the request of the Agent, not more

occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the Borrower
shall at its expense provide an Independent Appraisal with respect to one or
more Railcars designated by the Agent (which may include all of the Portfolio
Railcars). The Agent also may at any time and from time to time obtain an
Independent Appraisal of any Railcar (in addition to the Independent Appraisal
required pursuant to this Section 6.10(b)) at its own expense. Each Independent
Appraisal delivered pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent; provided that with respect to
any Railcar, when appropriate and acceptable to the Agent, any such Independent
Appraisal may be in the form of a letter from an Independent Appraiser
confirming the Independent Appraisal previously delivered by such Independent
Appraiser with respect to such Railcar. Without limitation of the foregoing,
subsequent Independent Appraisals of such Railcar shall be based on the most
recent Physical Inspection Report of such Railcar.

                  SECTION 6.11 STAMP TAX. If any jurisdiction in which any
Portfolio Railcar is registered, operated or located, from time to time,
requires the payment of a stamp tax, fee or its equivalent in order to perfect
the Agent's security interest in such Railcar or otherwise to allow the Agent to
realize upon the Collateral, the Borrower shall pay the amount of such stamp
tax, fee or its equivalent in accordance with Section 2.07(c).

made directly to the Collection Account. Prior to the establishment of the
Collection Account in accordance with the Depositary Agreement, all Cash Flow

                  (c)     Subject to the provisions of the Depository Agreement,
the Agent may from time to time in its sole discretion (and, to the extent such
application would have the effect of curing a Default under Section 9.01(a)
hereof or if the Loans have become or been declared immediately due and payable
pursuant to Section 9.02, shall) instruct the Depositary to pay the Agent any
amounts from time to time on deposit in the Liquidity Reserve Account; provided
that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and then be continuing,
(i) the Agent shall have consulted with the Borrower prior to giving such
instruction and (ii) if and to the extent determined by the Agent and the
Borrower that a reserve is required to be held in the Accounts in respect of
anticipated claims by a Lessee for payment of deposit, maintenance reserves or
insurance or indemnity payments, such reserve shall be retained in the Accounts.

remedies under any Lease Document or Management Document, comply with all
applicable written instruction from the Agent (it being understood that such

or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or requiring the grant of
any security for an obligation if security is given for some other obligation,
except pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 7.11 IMPAIRMENT OF SECURITY INTERESTS. No Facility
Party will take or omit to take any action which action or omission might or
would materially impair the security interests in favor of the Agent with
respect to the Collateral.

                  SECTION 7.12 DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO. The Debt Service
Coverage Ratio as of any Settlement Date will not be less than 1.10 to 1.00.

                  SECTION 7.13 NO AMENDMENTS TO THE LEASE DOCUMENTS. Without
prior written consent of the Agent or as expressly provided by the terms of this
Agreement, no Facility Party will amend, modify, consent to or permit any change
in the terms or otherwise alter or grant any consent or approval under any Lease
Document in a manner which would materially and adversely affect the Agent or
Lenders.

                  SECTION 7.14 LEASE DEFAULT. Without the prior written consent
of the Agent, which consent may be granted or withheld at the Agent's sole
discretion, no Facility Party will waive (or permit the waiver of) a Lease
Default or Lease Event of Default under a Lease; provided, however, that unless
a Default arising from the failure to make a payment when due hereunder or an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower may elect, in its
reasonable discretion and upon written notice to the Agent, to give such waiver
(or permit such waiver), so long as such waiver is limited to the particular
facts giving rise to such Lease Default or Lease Event of Default and does not
prejudice the Borrower's (or Agent's, by assignment) rights under the relevant
Lease to exercise remedies with respect to any other or future Lease Defaults or
Lease Events of Default; provided, further, that any such waiver without the
prior written consent of the Agent shall not cause a Lease which otherwise would
cease or fail to be an Eligible Lease to be an Eligible Lease.

                  SECTION 7.15 CONSOLIDATION WITH ANY OTHER PERSON. The Borrower
will not operate in a manner that would result in substantive consolidation of
the "estate" (as defined in Section 541(c) of the Bankruptcy Code) of the
Borrower with the "estate" of any other Person, and in such connection the
Borrower shall observe all corporate formalities, and maintain records
separately and independently from those of any other Person.

                  SECTION 7.16 LIMITATIONS ON EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES. The
Borrower will not employ or maintain any employees other than as required by
Applicable Law; provided that officers and directors shall not be deemed to be
employees for purposes of this Section 7.16.

                  SECTION 7.17 INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants
contained herein shall be given independent effect so that if a particular
action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that
such action or condition would be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be
within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a
Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                 OTHER COVENANTS

                  SECTION 8.01 QUIET ENJOYMENT. The Agent and each Lender hereby
covenant and agree that so long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, it shall not take or cause to be taken any action contrary to any
Lessee's or any permitted sublessee's right to quiet enjoyment of, and the
continuing possession, use and operation of, the relevant Portfolio Railcar
during the term of such Lease and in accordance with the terms of such Lease. To
the extent reasonably requested by a Lessee in connection with a Funding Date,
the Agent and each Lender shall confirm this Section 8.01.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                    DEFAULTS

                  SECTION 9.01 EVENTS OF DEFAULT. An Event of Default shall
exist upon the occurrence of any of the following specified events or conditions
(each an "Event of Default"):

                  (a)     Payment. Any default shall occur in the payment when
due (whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration or otherwise) of any principal
of or any interest on the Loans, or any default shall occur, which default shall
continue for 15 days after notice thereof has been given to the Borrower by the
Agent, in the payment when due of any fees or other amounts owing hereunder,
under any of the other Loan Documents or in connection herewith or therewith.

                  (b)     Out of Formula. A Collateral Deficiency shall exist on
any two consecutive Settlement Dates (after giving effect to all Loans made
pursuant to Section 2.01 and all amounts applied to repay the Loans pursuant to
Section 2.07(c) on each such Settlement Date), unless such Collateral Deficiency
exists solely as a result of a designation by the Agent of any Designated
Ineligible Type of Railcar or Lease or as a result of an exclusion of one or
more Eligible Railcars pursuant to clause (ix) of the definition of "Excluded
Asset Amount", in which case such Collateral Deficiency shall exist on any three
consecutive Settlement Dates (after giving effect to all Loans made pursuant to
Section 2.01 and all amounts applied to repay the Loans pursuant to Section
2.07(c) on each such Settlement Date).

                  (c)     Representations. Any representation, warranty or
statement made or deemed to be made by Trinity or any Facility Party herein, in
any of the other Loan Documents or in any Management Document, or in any
statement or certificate delivered or required to be delivered pursuant hereto
or thereto shall prove untrue in any material respect on the date as of which it
was made or deemed to have been made; provided, that with respect to any of the
foregoing as to which rescission of transfer is a remedy available under Section
4.11 of the Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement, no Event of Default shall
exist as a result of such event unless and until there has been a failure by
TILC (or the Performance Guarantor) to make the rescission payment described in
said Section 4.11.

                  (d)     Covenants. Trinity or any Facility Party shall:

                          (i)     default in the due performance or observance
                  by it of any term, covenant or agreement contained in Sections
                  6.01(a), 6.01(b), 6.02 (with respect only to such Facility
                  Party's existence), 6.06, 6.09, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16
                  or Article VII of this Agreement or in the Performance
                  Guaranty;

                          (ii)    default in the due performance or observance
                  by it of any term, covenant or agreement contained in Section
                  6.01(d) or 6.01(f) and such default shall continue unremedied
                  for a period of 2 Business Days; or

                          (iii)   default in the due performance or observance
                  by it of any term, covenant or agreement contained in Article
                  VI or Article VII (other than those referred to in subsections
                  (a), (b), (c), (d)(i), (d)(ii) or (d)(iii) of this Section
                  9.01) and such default shall continue unremedied for a period
                  of 15 days after the earlier of an executive officer of
                  Trinity or a Facility Party becoming aware of such default or
                  notice thereof given by the Agent; or

                          (iv)    default in the due performance or observance
                  by it of any term, covenant or agreement (other than those
                  referred to in subsections (a), (b), (c) or (d)(i), (d)(ii),
                  or (d)(iii) of this Section 9.01) contained in this Agreement
                  and such default shall continue unremedied for a period of 30
                  days after the earlier of an executive officer of a Facility
                  Party becoming aware of such default or notice thereof given
                  by the Agent.

                  (e)     Loan Documents. Except pursuant to the terms thereof,
any Loan Document shall (i) fail to be in full force and effect or Trinity or
any Facility Party shall so assert or (ii) fail to give the Agent and/or the
Lenders the security interests, liens, rights, powers and privileges purported
to be created thereby.

                  (f)     Cross-Default.

                          (i)     Either Trinity or the Manager (A) fails to
                  make payment when due (whether by scheduled maturity, required
                  prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise), regardless of
                  amount, in respect of any Debt or Guaranty Obligation (in
                  either case, other than in


                                      -71-

                  principal amount (including undrawn committed or available
                  amounts and including amounts owing to all creditors under
                  any combined or syndicated credit arrangement) of more than
                  $10,000,000, (B) fails to perform or observe any other
                  condition or covenant, or any other event shall occur or
                  condition shall exist, under any agreement or instrument
                  relating to any such Debt or Guaranty Obligation, if the
                  effect of such failure, event or condition is to cause, or to
                  permit the holder or holders or beneficiary or beneficiaries
                  of such Debt or Guaranty Obligation (or a trustee or agent on
                  behalf of such holder or holders or beneficiary or
                  beneficiaries) to cause, such Debt to be declared to be due
                  and payable prior to its stated maturity, or such Guaranty
                  Obligation to become payable, or cash collateral in respect
                  thereof to be demanded or (C) shall be required by the terms
                  of such Debt or Guaranty Obligation to offer to prepay or
                  repurchase such Debt or the primary Debt underlying such
                  Guaranty Obligation (or any portion thereof) prior to the
                  stated maturity thereof.

                          (ii)    There occurs under any Derivatives Agreement
                  an Early Termination Date (as defined in such Derivatives
                  Agreement) resulting from (A) any event of default under such

                  Defaulting Party (as defined in such Derivatives Agreement) or
                  (B) any Termination Event (as so defined) as to which the
                  Borrower is an Affected Party (as so defined), and, in either
                  event, the Derivatives Termination Value owed by the Borrower
                  as a result thereof is greater than $10,000,000.

                  (g)     Insolvency Events. (i) Trinity or any Facility Party
shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation,

insurance as to which the insurer does not dispute coverage), as to any single
or related series of transactions, incidents or conditions, of $100,000 (in the
case of the Borrower) or $10,000,000 (in the case of Trinity or any other
Facility Party) or more, and the same shall remain undischarged, unvacated and
unstayed pending appeal for a period of 30 days during which execution shall not
be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment
creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of Trinity, the Manager or the
Borrower to enforce any such judgment or Borrower shall enter into any agreement
to settle or compromise any pending or threatened litigation, as to any single
or related series of claims, involving payment of $100,000 or more by the
Borrower, or any non-monetary judgment, order or decree is entered against
Trinity or any Facility Party which has or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, and there shall be any period of 30 consecutive days
during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a
pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect.


                                -72-

                  (i)     ERISA. (i) An ERISA Event occurs with respect to a
Pension Plan or Multiemployer Plan which has resulted or could reasonably be
expected to result in liability of the Borrower under Title IV of ERISA to the
Pension Plan, Multiemployer Plan or the PBGC, or (ii) the Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate fails to pay when due, after the expiration of any applicable grace

other ERISA Affiliate.

                  (j)     Impairment of Collateral. Any security interest
purported to be created by any Collateral Document shall cease to be, or shall
be asserted by Trinity or any Facility Party not to be, a valid, perfected,
first-priority (except as otherwise expressly provided in such Collateral
Document) security interest in the securities, assets or properties covered
thereby.

                  (k)     Ownership. There shall occur a Borrower Change of
Control.

                  SECTION 9.02 ACCELERATION; REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, and at any time thereafter unless and until such Event of
Default has been waived in writing by the Required Lenders (or all of the
Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 11.03), the Agent shall, upon the
request and direction of the Required Lenders, by written notice to the
Borrower, take any of the following actions without prejudice to the rights of
the Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against Trinity or the Facility
Parties except as otherwise specifically provided for herein:

                  (a)     Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments
terminated whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b)     Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal of
and any accrued interest in respect of all Loans and any and all other
indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind owing by the Borrower to any
of the Lenders hereunder to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                  (c)     Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
interests created and existing under the Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Collateral Documents and
all rights of set-off.

                  (d)     Deliver the Notices of Lease Assignment to the
applicable Lessees with respect to any or all of the Portfolio Leases.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default
specified in Section 9.01(g) shall occur, then the Commitments shall
automatically terminate and all Loans, all accrued interest in respect thereof
and all accrued and unpaid fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing to
the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately
become due and payable without the giving of any notice or other action by the
Agent or the Lenders, which notice or other action is expressly waived by the
Borrower.

                  Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside
primarily with the Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by law, a
separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate "creditor" holding
a separate "claim" within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other insolvency statute.

<PAGE>
                  In case any one or more of the covenants and/or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall have been breached by
any Facility Party, then the Agent may proceed to protect and enforce the
Lenders' rights either by suit in equity and/or by action at law, including an
action for damages as a result of any such breach and/or an action for specific
performance of any such covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
such other Loan Document. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Borrower
agrees that failure to comply with any of the covenants contained herein may
cause irreparable harm and that specific performance shall be available as a
remedy in the event of any breach thereof. The Agent acting pursuant to this
paragraph shall be indemnified by the Borrower against all liability, loss or
damage, together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto
(including reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses) in accordance with
Section 11.05.

                  In the event a required rescission payment is received in the
Collection Account, then the Agent agrees to release to the Borrower, free and
clear of the lien of the Security Agreement, the relevant Lease(s) and
Railcar(s) the subject of such rescission payment, to enable the Borrower to
comply with its obligation to return such assets to TILC as described in Section
4.11 of the Asset Purchase and Contribution Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE X
                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

                  SECTION 10.01 APPOINTMENT; AUTHORIZATION.

                  (a)     Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates and
appoints Credit Suisse First Boston, New York Branch, as Agent of such Lender to
act as specified herein and in the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender
hereby authorizes the Agent, as the agent for such Lender, to take such action
on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated by the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere herein and in the other Loan Documents, the
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein and therein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, or shall otherwise exist against the Agent. In performing its
functions and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the
Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Lenders and does not assume and shall
not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of agency or trust
with or for any Facility Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
two sentences, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan
Documents with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
Applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties. The provisions of this Article X (other than
Section 10.09) are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and none
of the Facility Parties shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of
the provisions hereof (other than Section 10.09).

                  (b)     Release of Collateral. The Lenders irrevocably
authorize the Agent, at the Agent's option and in its discretion, to release any
security interest in or Lien on any Collateral granted to or held by the Agent
(i) upon termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, termination
of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations, including all fees
and indemnified costs and expenses that are payable pursuant to the terms of the
Loan Documents, (ii) if such Collateral constitutes property sold or to be sold
or disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or (iii) if approved by the Required
Lenders or Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Section 11.03. Upon
the request of the Agent, the Lenders will


                                      -74-
<PAGE>
confirm in writing the Agent's authority to release particular types or items
of Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.01(b).

                  SECTION 10.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Agent may execute any
of its duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and
other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

                  SECTION 10.03 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection herewith or in connection with any of the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (except for its own gross negligence
or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein)
or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders or participants for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any of the Facility
Parties contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any
certificate, report, document, financial statement or other written or oral
statement referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in
connection herewith or in connection with the other Loan Documents, or
enforceability or sufficiency therefor of any of the other Loan Documents, or
for any failure of any Facility Party to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder or be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or
observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements
contained herein or therein or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or of
the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default or to
inspect the properties, books or records of the Facility Parties.

                  SECTION 10.04 RELIANCE ON COMMUNICATIONS. The Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex, teletype or e-mail message, statement, order or other
document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any of
the Facility Parties, independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Agent in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct). The Agent may
deem and treat each Lender as the owner of its interests hereunder for all
purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent in accordance with Section 11.06(b). The
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any
of the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders
(or to the extent specifically provided in Section 11.03, all the Lenders) and
such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all the Lenders (including their successors and assigns). Where
this Agreement expressly permits or prohibits an action unless the Required
Lenders otherwise determine, the Agent shall, and in all other instances the
Agent may, but shall not be required to, initiate any solicitation for the
consent or vote of the Lenders.

                  SECTION 10.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, Manager Event of
Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Agent for the accounts
of the Lenders, unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender, the Manager
or the Borrower referring to this Agreement or the Management Agreement, as
applicable, describing such


                                      -75-
<PAGE>
Default, the Manager or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". If the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default, Manager Event of Default or Event of Default as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that unless
and until the Agent has received any such direction, the Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default, Manager Event of Default or Event of Default or it
shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

                  SECTION 10.06 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY
AGENT. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that the Agent has not made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of
the affairs of any Facility Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender as to any
matter, including whether the Agent has disclosed material information in its
possession. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, financial and
other condition, prospects and creditworthiness of the Facility Parties, and all
requirements of Applicable Law, and made its own decision to make its Loans
hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions,
prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Facility Parties.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, assets, property, financial or
other conditions, prospects or creditworthiness of any Facility Party or their
respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Agent.

                  SECTION 10.07 INDEMNIFICATION. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders agree, severally but not
jointly, to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower
and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according
to their respective Commitments (or if the Commitments have expired or been
terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of outstanding
Loans of the Lenders), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
which may at any time (including without limitation at any time following
payment in full of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by
or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with
any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to
the Agent of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such
Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this
Section. If any indemnity furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the
opinion of the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional indemnity is furnished. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements
of counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or


                                      -76-
<PAGE>
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any
document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is
not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The
agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Obligations and all
other obligations and amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

                  SECTION 10.08 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The Agent and
its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
accept deposits from, acquire Equity Interests in, and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting and other business with
the Borrower or any other Facility Party as though the Agent were not the Agent
hereunder or under another Loan Document. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant
to any such activities, the Agent or its Affiliates may receive information
regarding any Facility Party or its Affiliates (including information that may
be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Facility Party or
such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Agent shall not be under any obligation
to provide such information to them. With respect to the Loans made by and all
obligations owing to it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it was not the
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Agent in its
individual capacity.

                  SECTION 10.09 SUCCESSOR AGENTS. The Agent may, at any time,
resign upon 30 days' written notice to the Lenders. If the Agent resigns under a
Loan Document, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor Agent, which successor Agent, if other than a Committed Lender, shall
be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of
an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the resigning Agent, then the resigning
Agent shall have the right, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower,
to appoint a successor Agent; provided such successor is a Lender hereunder or a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States and has a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. If no successor Agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the resigning Agent, the
resigning Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower,
a successor Agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as an Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations as an Agent, as appropriate, under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and the provisions of this Section 10.09 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an
Agent under this Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as
Agent within 60 days after the retiring Agent's giving notice of resignation,
the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless become effective and the
Lenders shall perform all duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any,
as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.

                  SECTION 10.10 REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS. The Agent shall from time
to time upon reasonable request therefor furnish each Lender with copies of
Funding Packages, Railcar Documentation, Lease Documents and/or Loan Documents
(to the extent such Funding Packages, Railcar Documentation, Lease Documents
and/or Loan Documents are provided by the Borrower or other third parties, in
the form and to the extent provided to the Agent by the Borrower or such third
parties).

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  SECTION 11.01 NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS.

                  (a)     General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein,
all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including by facsimile transmission) and mailed, faxed or delivered, to the
address, facsimile number or (subject to subsection (c) below) electronic mail
address specified for notices as set forth on Schedule 11.01 or at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower and the
Agent. All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or
made upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the intended recipient
and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by the intended
recipient; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after deposit in the
mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent and receipt has
been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic mail (which form
of delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c) below), when
delivered; provided, however, that notices and other communications to the Agent
pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until actually received by such
Person. Any notice or other communication permitted to be given, made or
confirmed by telephone hereunder shall be given, made or confirmed by means of a
telephone call to the intended recipient at the number specified on Schedule
11.01, it being understood and agreed that a voicemail message shall in no event
be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

                  (b)     Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures.
Loan Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness
of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to requirements of
Applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and
shall be binding on all Facility Parties, the Agent and the Lenders. The Agent
may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
manually-signed original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request
or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document
or signature.

                  (c)     Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and
internet and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine
communications, such as financial statements and other information, and to
distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and may not be
used for any other purpose.

                  (d)     Reliance by Agent and Lenders. The Agent and the
Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices purportedly given by
or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Facility Party even if (i) such
notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not
preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein or (ii) the
terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation
thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender from all losses,
costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on
each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic
notices to and other communications with the Agent may be recorded by the Agent,
and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

                  SECTION 11.02 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure or
delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document and no course of dealing
between the Agent or any Lender and any of the Facility Parties shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided


                                      -78-
<PAGE>
herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the
Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any
Facility Party in any case shall entitle the Facility Parties to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action
in any circumstances without notice or demand.

                  SECTION 11.03 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Neither this
Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any of the terms hereof or thereof may
be amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated except, in the case of
this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Facility Parties, the Agent, and the Required Lenders or, in the case of
any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower, any other Facility Parties party thereto and the
Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the ability of the
Required Lenders to waive any Event of Default prior to the time the Agent shall
have declared, or the Required Lenders shall have requested the Agent to
declare, the Loans immediately due and payable pursuant to Article IX; provided,
however, that:

                          (i)     no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge
                  or termination shall, without the consent of each Lender
                  affected thereby:

                                  (A)     extend the Final Maturity Date or
                          extend or waive any Interim Maturity Date or any
                          payment of the Loans due thereon; provided that this
                          clause (A) shall not restrict the ability of the
                          Required Lenders to waive any Event of Default (other
                          than an Event of Default the waiver of which would
                          effectively result in any such extension or waiver),
                          prior to the time the Agent shall have declared, or
                          the Required Lenders shall have requested the Agent to
                          declare, the Loans immediately due and payable
                          pursuant to Article IX;

                                  (B)     reduce the rate, or extend the time of
                          payment, of interest (other than as a result of
                          waiving the applicability of any post-default increase
                          in interest rates) thereon or fees hereunder;

                                  (C)     reduce or waive the principal amount
                          of any Loan;

                                  (D)     increase the Commitment of a Lender
                          over the amount thereof in effect (it being understood
                          and agreed that a waiver of any Default, Manager
                          Default, Manager Event of Default or Event of Default
                          or a mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not
                          constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of
                          any Lender);

                                  (E)     release all or substantially all of
                          the Collateral securing the Credit Obligations
                          hereunder (provided that the Agent may, without
                          consent from any other Lender, release any Collateral
                          that is sold or transferred by the Borrower in
                          compliance with Section 7.05, or released in
                          compliance with Section 10.01(b));

                                  (F)     release any Facility Party from its
                          respective obligations under the Loan Documents and/or
                          the Management Documents;

                                  (G)     amend, modify or waive any provision
                          of this Section 11.03 or reduce any percentage
                          specified in, or otherwise modify, the definition of
                          Required Lenders;


                                      -79-
<PAGE>
                                  (H)     amend or modify or, if applicable,
                          waive the effects of the definition of "Advance Rate",
                          "Excluded Assets Amount" and/or "Borrowing Base"; or

                                  (I)     consent to the assignment or transfer
                          by the Borrower or the Manager of any of its rights
                          and obligations under (or in respect of) the Loan
                          Documents and the Management Agreement, except as
                          permitted thereby.

                          (ii) no provision of Article X may be amended without
                  the consent of the Agent.

                  Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders
is required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (i) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (ii) the Required Lenders may consent to allow
the Borrower to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

                  The various requirements of this Section 11.03 are cumulative.
Each Lender and each holder of a Note shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or
modification authorized by this Section 11.03 regardless of whether its Note
shall have been marked to make reference therein, and any consent by any Lender
or holder of a Note pursuant to this Section 11.03 shall bind any Person
subsequently acquiring a Note from it, whether or not such Note shall have been
so marked.

                  SECTION 11.04 EXPENSES. The Borrower shall pay promptly on
demand, but in any event by the next Settlement Date following demand, all
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses of the Lenders) incurred by the Agent (and its Affiliates) and
the Committed Lenders: (i) in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification and amendment of the Loan Documents
including, without limitation, (A) due diligence, collateral review,
syndication, transportation, computer, duplication, audit, insurance,
consultant, search, filing and recording fees and expenses and (B) the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto, with
respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities, or the
perfection, protection or preservation of rights and interests, under the Loan
Documents and Lease Documents, (ii) in connection with wire transfers to be made
by the Agent in connection with the distribution of proceeds under this
Agreement and (iii) in connection with any amendment, refinancing, modification,
supplement (or, if related to a request by any Facility Party or any Lessee,
interpretation), or waiver under any of the Notes or other Loan Documents and
Lease Documents whether or not such amendment, refinancing, modification,
supplement, interpretation or waiver is obtained or becomes effective, and in
connection with the consideration of any potential, actual or proposed
restructuring or workout of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the other
Loan Documents.

                  The Borrower shall pay promptly on demand, but in any event by
the next Settlement Date following demand, (i) all reasonable filing fees and
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the Agent and the Lenders and all
reasonable fees and expenses of special STB or other collateral or regulatory
counsel (and other local counsel reasonably engaged by the Agent), as the case
may be, in connection with the preparation and review of the Collateral
Documents and the other Loan Documents and Lease Documents from time to time
entered into or reviewed pursuant to this Agreement and all documents related
thereto, the search of railcar conveyance and Lien records, the recordation of
documents with the STB or other applicable Governmental Authority, inspection
and appraisal fees and the making of the Loans hereunder, whether or not any
Funding Date or other transaction contemplated hereby closes and (ii) all taxes
which the Agent or any Secured Party (as defined in the Security


                                      -80-
<PAGE>
Agreement) may be required to pay by reason of the security interests granted
in the Collateral (including any applicable transfer taxes) or to free any of
the Collateral from the lien thereof.

                  In addition, the Borrower shall pay promptly on demand, but in
any event by the next Settlement Date following demand, all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses and fees and expenses of any expert witnesses) incurred by the
Agent and the Lenders in connection with the enforcement and protection of the
rights of the Agent and the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents and any
amendments thereto and waivers thereof and any Manager Event of Default, Default
or Event of Default, including without limitation, the performance by the Agent
or the Lenders of any act any Facility Party has covenanted to do under the Loan
Documents and/or the Management Documents to the extent such Facility Party
fails to comply with any such covenant.

                  The Borrower shall pay all fees and expenses in connection
with the Depositary Agreement including, without limitation, all fees (including
any annual fee payable to the Depositary pursuant to the Depositary Agreement),
expenses and any indemnity payments to the Depositary and all fees and expenses
in creating, maintaining and administrating the Accounts.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower
does not pay any amounts described in this Section 11.04 when due, TILC shall be
liable for and shall pay such amounts on demand of the party entitled thereto.

                  SECTION 11.05 INDEMNIFICATION. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Facility Parties, jointly and
severally, agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless the Agent, each Lender,
each other Protected Party and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the
"Indemnitees") from and against (and without duplication of amounts payable or
the provisions which relate to such payment under the other provisions of the
Loan Documents): (i) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action
that are asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (other than the Agent or
any Lender) relating directly or indirectly to a claim, demand, action or cause
of action that such Person asserts or may assert against Trinity or any Facility
Party, any Affiliate of Trinity or any Facility Party or any of their respective
officers or directors; (ii) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of
action that may at any time (including at any time following repayment of the
Obligations and the resignation or removal of the Agent or the replacement of
any Lender) be asserted or imposed against any Indemnitee, arising out of or
relating to, the Loan Documents, any predecessor Loan Documents, the
Commitments, the use of or contemplated use of the proceeds of any Loan, or the
relationship of Trinity, any Facility Party, the Agent and the Lenders under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iii) any administrative or
investigative proceeding by any Governmental Authority arising out of or related
to a claim, demand, action or cause of action described in clause (i) or (ii)
above; (iv) any Loan Document, Lease Document, other Transaction Document or any
document contemplated hereby or thereby and payments made pursuant hereto or
thereto or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or the exercise of
rights and remedies hereunder or thereunder, any breach by Trinity or any
Facility Party of any Transaction Document or Lease Document or a Lessee of any
Lease Document, (v) any Railcar, any Part or the Borrower's acquisition or
ownership of, or the selection, design, financing, lease, control, operation,
condition, location, storage, modification, repair, sale, use, maintenance,
possession, registration, delivery, nondelivery, transportation, transfer or
disposition of, any Railcar or Part; (vi) any liability arising under or in
respect of any Environmental Law, in each case relating to any Railcar or the
use, operation or ownership thereof, whether by Trinity or any Facility Party,
any Lessee or any other Person; (vii) any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments, costs
and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by, imposed on or asserted
against such Indemnitee in


                                      -81-
<PAGE>
connection with any investigation or administrative or judicial proceeding
(whether or not such Indemnitee) shall be designated a party thereto) brought
or threatened relating to or arising out of any Collateral Document or in any
other way connected with the enforcement of any of the terms of, or the
presentation of any rights under, or in any way relating to or arising out of
the manufacture, ownership, ordering, purchasing, delivery, control,
acceptance, lease, financing, possession, operation, condition, sale, return or
other disposition or use of the Collateral (including, without limitation,
intent or other defects, whether or not discoverable) the violation of any laws
of any country, state or other governmental body or unit, or any tort
(including, without limitation, any claims, arising or imposed under the
doctrine of strict liability, or for or on account of injury to or the death of
any Person (including any Indemnities), or property damage or contract claim;
and (viii) any and all liabilities (including liabilities under indemnities),
losses, costs or expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) that
any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing
claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding, or as a result of the
preparation of any defense in connection with any foregoing claim, demand,
action, cause of action or proceeding, in all cases, and whether or not an
Indemnitee is a party to such claim, demand, action, cause of action, or
Proceeding (all the foregoing, collectively; the "Indemnified Liabilities").
THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LIABILITIES AND
COSTS ARE IN ANY WAY OR TO ANY EXTENT OWED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNDER ANY
CLAIM OR THEORY OF STRICT LIABILITY OR CAUSED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY ANY
NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND BY ANY INDEMNITEE; provided that no
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any claim caused by its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct and provided further, that no Indemnitee
shall be entitled to indemnification for any claim arising solely out of (i)
the bankruptcy, insolvency or other financial inability of one or more Lessees
to make payments under a related Lease or (ii) the decline in market value of a
Portfolio Railcar, to the extent not attributable to the failure of a Facility
Party to perform an obligation with respect to such Portfolio Railcar under a
Transaction Document. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other
proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 11.05 applies, such indemnity
shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding
is brought by Trinity, any Facility Party, their respective directors,
shareholders or creditors or an Indemnitee or any other Person or any
Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated. Each Facility Party agrees not to assert
any claim against the Agent, any Lender, any other Creditor, any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys, agents and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise
relating to the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans. Without
prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Facility Parties
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the agreements and obligations of
the Facility Parties contained in this Section 11.05 shall survive the
repayment of the Loans and other obligations under the Loan Documents and the
termination of the Commitments hereunder.

                  The Facility Parties shall, no later than 20 days following
demand, reimburse any Indemnitee for any Indemnified Liability referred to above
or, upon request from any Indemnitee, shall pay such amounts directly. Any
payment made to or on behalf of any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 11.05
shall be adjusted to such amount as will, after taking into account all Taxes
imposed with respect to the accrual or receipt of such payment (as the same may
be increased pursuant to this sentence), equal the amount of the payment. To the
extent that any Facility Party in fact indemnifies any Indemnitee pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 11.05 (other than in respect of Taxes), such
Facility Party shall be subrogated to such Indemnitee's rights in the affected
transaction and shall have a right to determine the settlement of claims
therein.

                  If a claim of the type described above is made against an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee has notice thereof, such Indemnitee shall
promptly, upon receiving such notice, give notice of such claim


                                      -82-
<PAGE>
to the Borrower; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release any Facility Party from any of its obligations hereunder except if and
to the extent that such failure results in an increase in any Facility Party's
indemnification obligations hereunder. The Facility Parties shall be entitled,
in each case at their sole cost and expense, acting through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the relevant Indemnitee: (i) in any judicial or administrative
proceeding that involves solely a claim of the type described above, to assume
responsibility for and control thereof, (ii) in any judicial or administrative
proceeding involving a claim of the type described above and other claims
related or unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document (other than with respect to Taxes), to assume
responsibility for and control of such claim, to the extent that the same may
be and is severed from such other claims (and such Indemnitee shall use its
best efforts to obtain such severance), and (iii) in any other case, to be
consulted by such Indemnitee with respect to judicial proceedings subject to
the control of such Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to
the contrary, no Facility Party shall be entitled to assume responsibility for
and control of any such judicial or administrative proceedings: (A) while an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (B) if such proceedings
will involve any risk of criminal liability or a material risk of the sale,
forfeiture or loss of any part of the Collateral; or (C) to the extent that the
Indemnitee has defenses available to it which are not available to Trinity or
any Facility Party and allowing Trinity and/or such Facility Party to assert
such defenses will be prejudicial to the interests of such Indemnitee; provided
that the limitation on the Facility Parties' ability to control such judicial
or administrative proceeding shall apply only to those aspects of such
proceeding which address issues with respect to which such defenses are
available.

                  The relevant Indemnitee shall supply the Borrower with such
information reasonably requested by the Borrower as is necessary or advisable
for the Borrower and/or any other Facility Party to control or participate in
any proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section 11.05. Such Indemnitee
shall not enter into a settlement or other compromise with respect to any
covered claim without the prior written consent of the Borrower, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such Indemnitee waives its
right to be protected with respect to such covered claim.

                  SECTION 11.06 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a)     Generally. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
assigns of the parties hereto; provided that no Facility Party may assign or
transfer any of its interests and obligations without the prior written consent
of either the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as the terms set forth in Section
11.03 may require;

                  (b)     Assignments. Any Lender may assign all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
all or a portion of its Loans and its Commitments); provided, however, that

                          (i)     each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
                  Assignee who, unless otherwise consented to by the Borrower,
                  is not a Competitor of the Borrower;

                          (ii)    except in the case of an assignment to another
                  Lender, an Affiliate of an existing Lender or any Approved
                  Fund (A) the aggregate amount of the Commitment of the
                  assigning Lender subject to such assignment (determined as of
                  the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
                  assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not, without the
                  consent of the Borrower and the Agent, be less than $5,000,000
                  and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or such other amount
                  as shall equal the assigning Lender's entire Commitment) and
                  (B) after giving effect to such assignment, unless otherwise
                  consented to by the Borrower, the aggregate amount of the
                  Commitment and/or Loans of the assigning Lender shall not be
                  less than


                                      -83-
<PAGE>
                  $2,500,000 (unless the assigning Lender shall have assigned
                  its entire Commitment and/or the entire balance of the
                  outstanding Loans);

                          (iii)   the parties to such assignment shall execute
                  and deliver to the Agent for its acceptance an Assignment and
                  Acceptance in the form of Exhibit C, together with any Note
                  subject to such assignment and a processing fee of $3,500,
                  payable or agreed between the assigning Lender and the
                  assignee.

                  (c)     Assignment and Acceptance. By executing and delivering
an Assignment and Acceptance in accordance with this Section 11.06, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and the
assignee warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee; (ii) except as set forth in
clause (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other
Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or
thereto, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or the
financial condition of the Facility Parties or the performance or observance by
any Facility Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any of the
other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto or thereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is
legally authorized to enter into such assignment agreement; (iv) such assignee
confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, together with copies of the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 6.01 and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such
powers under this Agreement or any other Loan Document as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be performed by it
as a Lender. Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and
Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
of such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits of a Lender
hereunder and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment,
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement.
Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section 11.06(c), the
assignor, the Agent and the Facility Parties shall make appropriate arrangements
so that, if required, new Notes are issued to the assignor and the assignee. If
the assignee is not a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to
exemption from deduction or withholding of Taxes in accordance with Section
3.01.

                  (d)     Register. The Borrower hereby designates the Agent to
serve as the Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of this subsection 11.06(d),
to (i) maintain a register (the "Register") on which the Agent will record the
Commitments from time to time of each Lender, the Loans made by each Lender and
each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender
and to (ii) retain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to the
Agent pursuant to this Section. Failure to make any such recordation, or any
error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower's obligation in respect
of such Loans. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence
of manifest error,


                                      -84-
<PAGE>
and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person in whose
name a Loan and the Note evidencing the same is registered as the owner thereof
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice or any provision
herein to the contrary. With respect to any Lender, the assignment or other
transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of,
and interest on, any Loan made and any Note issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be effective until such assignment or other transfer is recorded on
the Register and, except to the extent provided in this subsection 11.06(d),
otherwise complies with Section 11.06, and prior to such recordation all
amounts owing to the transferring Lender with respect to such Commitments,
Loans and Notes shall remain owing to the transferring Lender. The registration
of assignment or other transfer of all or part of any Commitments, Loans and
Notes for a Lender shall be recorded by the Agent on the Register only upon the
acceptance by the Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and
Acceptance and payment of the administrative fee referred to in Section
11.06(b)(iii). The Register shall be available at the offices where kept by the
Agent for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time upon
reasonable prior notice to the Agent.

                  (e)     Participations. Each Lender may, without the consent
of the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to one or more Persons in all
or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment or the Loans owing to it
and any Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) the participant shall be entitled to the benefit of right of
setoff contained in Section 11.08 and the yield protection provisions contained
in Sections 3.01, 3.03 and 3.04 to the same extent that the Lender from which
such participant acquired its participation would be entitled to the benefits of
such yield protections; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
reimburse any participant pursuant to Sections 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04 in an amount
which exceeds the amount that would have been payable thereunder to such Lender
had such Lender not sold such participation and (iv) the Facility Parties, the
Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
obligations of the Facility Parties relating to the Obligations owing to such
Lender and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications or waivers decreasing the
amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on such Loans or
Notes, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the
payment of interest on such Loans or Notes or extending its Commitment).

                  (f)     Other Assignments. Any Lender may at any time (i)
assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Notes to a
Federal Reserve Bank, (ii) pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
portion of its interest and rights under this Agreement (including all or any
portion of its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender and (iii)
grant to a Conduit Lender referred to in subsection (h) below identified as such
in writing from time to time by such Lender to the Agent and the Borrower the
option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loans that such Lender
would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to the Agreement;
provided that no such assignment, option, pledge or security interest shall
release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
Federal Reserve Bank or other person to which such option, pledge or assignment
has been made for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (g)     Information. Any Lender may furnish any information
concerning any Facility Party in the possession of such Lender from time to time
to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
participants), subject, however, to the provisions of Section 11.07.

                  (h)     Conduit Lenders, etc. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any Lender, (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a
conduit lender sponsored by such Granting


                                      -85-
<PAGE>
Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender
to the Agent and the Borrower (a "Conduit Lender") the option to fund all or
any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to
fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall
constitute a commitment by any Conduit Lender to fund any Loan and (ii) if a
Conduit Lender elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund
all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund
such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The funding of a Loan by a Conduit
Lender hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the
same extent that, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender.
Each party hereto hereby agrees that no Conduit Lender shall be liable for any
indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be
liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such
indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any Conduit Lender may disclose on a confidential
basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating
agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee to such
Conduit Lender. This subsection (h) may not be amended without the prior
written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Loan is being
funded by a Conduit Lender at the time of such amendment. Credit Suisse First
Boston, New York Branch, hereby designates each of Alpine Securitization Corp.,
Greenwich Funding Corporation and Gramercy Capital Corporation as "Conduit
Lenders" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
grants to each such Conduit Lender the option to fund all or any portion of the
Loans contemplated to be made hereunder by Credit Suisse First Boston, New York
Branch. Wachovia Bank, National Association, hereby designates Variable Funding
Capital Corporation as a "Conduit Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and grants to such Conduit Lender the option to
fund all or any portion of the Loans contemplated to be made hereunder by
Wachovia Bank, National Association.

                  SECTION 11.07 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential); (ii) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the Agent or Lender, as
applicable; (iii) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process; (iv) to any other party to this
Agreement; (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any
suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (vi) subject to
an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
Section, to (A) any Eligible Assignee of or participant in, or any prospective
Eligible Assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement, (B) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or
prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective
counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction
relating to obligations of the Borrower or (C) any Support Party or any managing
agent of a Lender that is a commercial paper conduit; (vii) with the written
consent of the Borrower; (viii) to the extent such information (A) becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (B)
becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than the Borrower; or (ix) to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or any other similar organization or any nationally recognized
rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's or its
Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect
to such Lender or its Affiliates. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from or on behalf of any Facility
Party relating to any Facility Party or its respective business, other than any
such information that is available to the Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by or on behalf of a Facility Party;
provided that, in the case of information received from or on behalf of a
Facility Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified in
writing at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain
the confidentiality of Information as


                                      -86-
<PAGE>
provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information.

                  SECTION 11.08 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or
hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of
limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is authorized at
any time and from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind (all of such rights being hereby expressly waived), to
set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or specific)
and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including,
without limitation, branches, agencies or Affiliates of such Lender wherever
located) to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against obligations
and liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders hereunder, under the Notes, under
the other Loan Documents or otherwise, irrespective of whether the Agent or the
Lenders shall have made any demand hereunder and although such obligations,
liabilities or claims, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured, and any
such set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default even though such charge is made or entered on the books
of such Lender subsequent thereto. The Borrower hereby agrees that to the extent
permitted by law any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans and
Commitments hereunder may exercise all rights of set-off with respect to its
participation interest as fully as if such Person were a Lender hereunder and
any such set-off shall reduce the amount owed by the Borrower to the Lender.

                  SECTION 11.09 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. The Agent, the Lenders
and the Facility Parties and any other parties to the Loan Documents intend to
contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in
effect. In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the
terms and provisions contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to
create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money,
interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by
Applicable Law from time to time in effect (the "Maximum Rate"). Neither any
Facility Party nor any present or future guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons
hereafter becoming liable for payment of any Credit Obligation shall ever be
liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be required to pay interest
thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be lawfully charged under
Applicable Law from time to time in effect, and the provisions of this section
shall control over all other provisions of the Loan Documents which may be in
conflict or apparent conflict herewith. The Lenders and the Agent expressly
disavow any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned interest or
finance charges in the event the maturity of any Credit Obligation is
accelerated. If (i) the maturity of any Credit Obligation is accelerated for any
reason, (ii) any Credit Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held
to constitute interest are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or
(iii) any Lender of any other holder of any or all of the Credit Obligations
shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which
would otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the Credit Obligations to
an amount in excess of that permitted to be charged by Applicable Law then in
effect, then all sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal
limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding
principal of the related Credit Obligations or, at such Lender's or holder's
option, promptly returned to the Borrower or the other payor thereof upon such
determination. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under
any specific circumstance, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under Applicable
Law, the Agent, the Lenders and the Facility Parties (and any other payors
thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under Applicable Law, (i)
characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than
as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and
(iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest
throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing the Credit
Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to time
thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect
under Applicable Law in order to lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest
permitted under Applicable Law. In the event Applicable Law provides for


                                      -87-
<PAGE>
an interest ceiling under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code (the "Texas
Finance Code") as amended, for that day, the ceiling shall be the "weekly
ceiling" as defined in the Texas Finance Code; provided that if any Applicable
Law permits greater interest, the Law permitting the greatest interest shall
apply. As used in this Section 11.09 the term "Applicable Law" includes,
without limitation the laws of the State of Texas, the laws of the State of New
York or the laws of the United States of America, whichever laws allow the
greatest interest, as such laws now exist or may be changed or amended or come
into effect in the future.

                  SECTION 11.10 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall
be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or
account for more than one such counterpart.

                  SECTION 11.11 INTEGRATION. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT, TOGETHER
WITH THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES AND
MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL
AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE
PARTIES. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor
of the Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a
conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint
participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither
against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair
meaning thereof.

                  SECTION 11.12 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Agent and
each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Agent or any Lender or
on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Agent or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time of any
Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or
any other Obligation shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

                  SECTION 11.13 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents to which any Facility Party is a party that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 11.14 HEADINGS. The headings of the sections and
subsections hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way
affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 11.15 MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in
favor of the Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all
of the Obligations. To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment or payments
to the Agent (or to the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders), or the Agent
enforces any security interests or exercises its rights of set-off, and such
payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or set-off or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any


                                      -88-
<PAGE>
bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable
cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies
therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or
set-off had not occurred.

                  SECTION 11.16 PERFORMANCE BY THE AGENT. If any Facility Party
fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any Management Document in a timely fashion, the Agent shall be
entitled, but not obliged, to perform such obligation at the expense of the
Borrower and without waiving any rights that it may have with respect to such
breach.

                  SECTION 11.17 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Each Protected Party,
including without limitation each Support Party, is an express third party
beneficiary hereof.

                  SECTION 11.18 NO PROCEEDINGS. (a) Each party hereto hereby
agrees that it will not institute against any Conduit Lender, or join any other
Person in instituting against any Conduit Lender, any bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership, liquidation or similar proceeding from the Closing Date until one
year plus one day following the last day on which all commercial paper notes and
other publicly or privately placed indebtedness for borrowed money of such
Conduit Lender shall have been indefeasibly paid in full.

                  (b)     No recourse under any obligation, covenant or
agreement of Conduit Lender as contained in any Loan Document shall be had
against any incorporator, stockholder, affiliate, officer, employee or director
of the Conduit Lender, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute or otherwise; it being expressly
agreed and understood that the agreements of each Conduit Lender contained in
any Loan Document are solely corporate obligations of such Conduit Lender and
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to or be incurred by the
incorporators, stockholders, affiliates, officers, employees or directors of
such Conduit Lender, under or by reason of any of the respective obligations,
covenants or agreements of such Conduit Lender contained in any Loan Document,
or implied therefrom, and that any and all personal liability of every such
incorporator, stockholder, affiliate, officer, employee or director of such
Conduit Lender for breaches by such Conduit Lender of any such obligation,
covenant or agreement, which liability may arise either at common law or in
equity, by statute or constitution, or otherwise, is hereby expressly waived as
a condition of and in consideration for the execution of this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 11.18 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

                  (c)     Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, no Conduit Lender shall have any obligation to pay any amount
required to be paid by it hereunder or thereunder to any party hereto, in excess
of any amount available to such Conduit Lender after paying or making provision
for the payment of its commercial paper notes. All payment obligations of each
Conduit Lender hereunder are contingent upon the availability of funds in excess
of the amounts necessary to pay commercial paper notes; and each of the parties
hereto agree that they shall not have a claim under Section 101(5) of the United
States Bankruptcy Code if and to the extent that any such payment obligation
exceeds the amount available to such Conduit Lender to pay such amounts after
paying or making provision for the payment of its commercial paper notes.

                  SECTION 11.19 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

                  (a)     THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE

SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK),
WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. Chapter 346 of the Texas
Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and
revolving tri-party accounts) does not apply to this Agreement or to any other
Loan Document. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document may be brought in the courts of the State of New York
in New York County, or of the United States for the Southern District of New
York and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Facility Party
hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditional, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each Facility
Party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
proceeding brought in such court and any claim that any such proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                  (b)     Each Facility Party hereby irrevocably appoints C.T.
Corporation System its authorized agent to accept and acknowledge service of any
and all process which may be served in any suit, action or proceeding of the
nature referred to in this Section 11.19 and consents to process being served in
any such suit, action or proceeding upon C.T. Corporation System in any manner
or by the mailing of a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to such Facility Party's address referred to
in Section 11.01. Each Facility Party agrees that such service (i) shall be
deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit,
action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it.
Nothing in this Section 11.19 shall affect the right of any Lender to serve
process in any manner permitted by law or limit the right of any Lender to bring
proceedings against the Borrower in the courts of any jurisdiction or
jurisdictions.

                  SECTION 11.20 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR
ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER
FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED
BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY.

                  SECTION 11.21 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall become
effective at such time when it shall have been executed by the Facility Parties
and the Agent, and the Agent shall have received copies hereof (telefaxed or
otherwise) which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each Committed
Lender, and thereafter this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Facility Parties, the Agent and each Lender and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, unless the conditions set forth in
Section 4.01 have been satisfied by the Facility Parties or waived by the
Lenders on or before July 16, 2002, none of the Facility Parties, the Agent or
the Lenders shall have any obligations under this Agreement.
