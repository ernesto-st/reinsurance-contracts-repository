                                   THE CREDITS

   2.01 Amounts and Terms of Commitments. (a) Each Lender severally agrees, on
the terms and conditions set forth herein, to make loans to the Company
(together with all "Revolving Loans" owing to such Lender on the Closing Date
pursuant to and as defined in the Original Credit Agreement, the "Revolving
Loans") from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing
Date to the Revolving Termination Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at
any time the total of the amounts set forth on Schedule 2.01 (such total amount,
as the same may be reduced under Section 2.05 or as a result of one or more
assignments under Section 10.08, the Lender's "Revolving Loan Commitment");
provided, however, that, after giving effect to any Borrowing of Revolving Loans
(exclusive of Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations which are
repaid with the proceeds of, and simultaneously with the incurrence of, the
respective incurrence of Revolving Loans), the Effective Amount of all
outstanding Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations, shall not at
any time exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment; and provided further,
that the Effective Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender plus the
participation of such Lender in the Effective Amount of all Swing Loan Loans and
L/C Obligations shall not at any time exceed such Lender's Revolving Loan
Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, and
subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company may borrow under
this Section 2.01(a), prepay under Section 2.06 and reborrow under this Section
2.01(a). Upon the satisfaction of each of conditions set forth in Section 5.01,
all "Revolving Loans" owing to the Existing Lenders, on the Closing Date under
and as defined in the Original Credit Agreement shall thereupon constitute
Revolving Loans hereunder subject to the terms of this Agreement.

                                       25
<PAGE>

      (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Bank
agrees to make loans to the Company (together with all "Swing Line Loans" owing
to the Swing Line Bank on the Closing Date pursuant to and as defined in the
Original Credit Agreement, the "Swing Line Loans") from time to time on any
Business Day during the period from the Closing Date to the Swing Line
Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding
not to exceed $15,000,000 (the "Swing Line Loan Commitment"); provided, after
giving effect to any Borrowing of Swing Line Loans, the Effective Amount of all
outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not at any time exceed the Swing Line Loan
Commitment; and provided further, that the Effective Amount of all outstanding
Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations shall not at any time
exceed aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment. Prior to the Swing Line Termination
Date, the Company may use the Swing Line Loan Commitment by borrowing, prepaying
the Swing Line Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof. All Swing Line Loans shall bear interest
at the Swing Line Rate and shall not be entitled to be converted into Loans that
bear interest at any other rate. Upon the satisfaction of each of conditions set
forth in Section 5.01, all "Swing Line Loans" owing to the Swing Line Bank on
the Closing Date under and as defined in the Original Credit Agreement shall
thereupon constitute Swing Line Loans hereunder subject to the terms of this
Agreement.

      (c)   Increase of Revolving Loan Commitment. (i) At any time, the Company
may request (in consultation with the Agent) that the aggregate Revolving Loan
Commitment be increased in a minimum amount equal to, and in minimum increments
of, $1,000,000, provided that, (A) the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment shall
at no time exceed $125,000,000 and (B) the Company shall not previously have
reduced the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment. Such request shall be made in a
written notice given to the Agent and the Lenders by the Company not less than
twenty (20) Business Days prior to the proposed effective date of such increase,
which notice (a "Commitment Increase Notice") shall specify the amount of the
proposed increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment and the proposed
effective date of such increase. In the event of such a Commitment Increase
Notice, each of the Lenders shall be given the opportunity to participate in the
requested increase. No Lender shall have any obligation to increase its
Commitment pursuant to a Commitment Increase Notice. On or prior to the date
that is fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Commitment Increase
Notice, each Lender shall submit to the Agent a notice indicating the maximum
amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment in connection with such
Commitment Increase Notice (any such notice to the Agent being herein a "Lender
Increase Notice"). Any Lender which does not submit a Lender Increase Notice to
the Agent prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15) Business Day period shall
be deemed to have denied any increase in its Commitment. In the event that the
increases of Commitments set forth in the Lender Increase Notices exceed the
amount requested by the Company in the Commitment Increase Notice, the Agent and
the Arranger shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to allocate
the amount of increases necessary to meet the Company's Commitment Increase
Notice. In the event that the Lender Increase Notices are less than the amount
requested by the Company, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
proposed effective date the Company may notify the Agent of any financial
institution that shall have agreed to become a "Lender" party hereto (a
"Proposed New Lender") in connection with the Commitment Increase Notice. Any
Proposed New Lender shall be subject to the consent of the Agent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Company shall not have arranged any
Proposed New Lender(s) to commit to the shortfall from the Lender

                                       26
<PAGE>

Increase Notices, then the Company shall be deemed to have reduced the amount of
its Commitment Increase Notice to the aggregate amount set forth in the Lender
Increase Notices. Based upon the Lender Increase Notices, any allocations made
in connection therewith and any notice regarding any Proposed New Lender, if
applicable, the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders on or before the
Business Day immediately prior to the proposed effective date of the amount of
each Lender's and Proposed New Lenders' Commitment (the "Effective Commitment
Amount") and the amount of the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment, which amount
shall be effective on the following Business Day. Any increase in the aggregate
Revolving Loan Commitment shall be subject to the following conditions
precedent: (1) the Company shall have obtained from each Subsidiary party to a
Loan Document its reaffirmation of such Loan Documents, if any, executed by it,
which consent and reaffirmation shall be in writing and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, (2) as of the date of the Commitment
Increase Notice and as of the proposed effective date of the increase in the
aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment, all representations and warranties shall be
true and correct in all material respects as though made on such date (except to
the extent such representation or warranties expressly refer to an earlier date,
in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date) and no
event shall have occurred and then be continuing which constitutes a Default or
Event of Default, (3) the Company, the Agent and each Proposed New Lender or
Lender that shall have agreed to provide a "Commitment" in support of such
increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment shall have executed and
delivered a "Commitment and Acceptance" substantially in the form of Exhibit G
hereto, (4) counsel for the Company and for any such guarantors shall have
provided to the Agent supplemental opinions in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent and (5) the Company and the Proposed New Lender shall
otherwise have executed and delivered such other instruments and documents as
are consistent with those required under Article V or that the Agent shall have
reasonably requested in connection with such increase. If any fee shall be
charged by the Buying Lenders (as defined below) in connection with any such
increase, such fee shall be in accordance with then prevailing market
conditions, which market conditions shall have been reasonably documented by the
Agent to the Company. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to any
increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment, the Agent shall promptly
advise the Company and each Lender of the effective date of such increase. Upon
the effective date of any increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment
that is provided by a Proposed New Lender, such Proposed New Lender shall be a
party to this Agreement as a Lender and shall have the rights and obligations of
a Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be
deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment
hereunder at any time.

            (ii) For purposes of this clause (ii), (A) the term "Buying
Lender(s)" shall mean (1) each Lender the Effective Commitment Amount of which
is greater than its Commitment prior to the effective date of any increase in
the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment and (2) each Proposed New Lender that is
allocated an Effective Commitment Amount in connection with any Commitment
Increase Notice, and (B) the term "Selling Lender(s)" shall mean each Lender
whose Commitment is not being increased from that in effect prior to such
increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment. Effective on the effective
date of any increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment pursuant to
clause (i) above, each Selling Lender hereby sells, grants, assigns and conveys
to each Buying Lender, without recourse, warranty, or representation of any
kind, except as specifically provided herein, an

                                       27
<PAGE>

undivided percentage in such Selling Lender's right, title and interest in and
to its outstanding Loans in the respective dollar amounts and percentages
necessary so that, from and after such sale, each such Selling Lender's
outstanding Loans shall equal such Selling Lender's Pro Rata Share (calculated
based upon the Effective Commitment Amounts) of the outstanding Loans. Effective
on the effective date of the increase in the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment
pursuant to clause (i) above, each Buying Lender hereby purchases and accepts
such grant, assignment and conveyance from the Selling Lenders. Each Buying
Lender hereby agrees that its respective purchase price for the portion of the
outstanding Loans purchased hereby shall equal the respective dollar amount
necessary so that, from and after such payments, each Buying Lender's
outstanding Loans shall equal such Buying Lender's Pro Rata Share (calculated
based upon the Effective Commitment Amounts) of the outstanding Loans. Such
amount shall be payable on the effective date of the increase in the aggregate
Revolving Loan Commitment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Agent. The Agent, in turn, shall wire transfer any such funds received to the
Selling Lenders, in same day funds, for the sole account of the Selling Lenders.
Each Selling Lender hereby represents and warrants to each Buying Lender that
such Selling Lender owns the Loans being sold and assigned hereby for its own
account and has not sold, transferred or encumbered any or all of its interest
in such Loans, except for participations which will be extinguished upon payment
to Selling Lender of an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding Loans
being sold by such Selling Lender. Each Buying Lender hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, except for each Selling Lender's representations and warranties
contained in the foregoing sentence, each such Buying Lender has entered into
its Commitment and Acceptance with respect to such increase on the basis of its
own independent investigation and has not relied upon, and will not rely upon,
any explicit or implicit written or oral representation, warranty or other
statement of the Lenders or the Agent concerning the authorization, execution,
legality, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The Company hereby agrees to
compensate each Lender for all losses, expenses and liabilities incurred by each
Lender in connection with the sale and assignment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan
hereunder on the terms and in the manner as set forth in Section 4.04.

   2.02  Loan Accounts.

      (a)   The Loans made by each Lender and the Letters of Credit Issued by
the Issuing Bank shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records
maintained by such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in the ordinary
course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent, the Issuing
Bank and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of the Loans
made by the Lenders to the Company, and the Letters of Credit issued for the
account of the Company, and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to
record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect
the obligation of the Company hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to
the Loans or any Letter of Credit.

      (b)   Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, the Loans
made by such Lender may be evidenced by one or more Notes, instead of or in
addition to loan accounts. Each such Lender shall record on the schedules
annexed to its Note(s) the date, amount and maturity of each Loan made by it and
the amount of each payment of principal made by the Company with respect
thereto. Each such Lender is irrevocably authorized by the

                                       28
<PAGE>

Company to make such recordations on its Note(s) and each Lender's record shall
be deemed prima facie correct; provided, however, that the failure of a Lender
to make, or an error in making, a notation thereon with respect to any Loan
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company hereunder or
under any such Note to such Lender. Certain Notes issued as of the Closing Date
shall be issued in substitution for, and shall amend and restate, each of the
respective "Notes" issued to the Existing Lenders pursuant to and defined in the
Original Credit Agreement. No such substitutions, amendments and restatements
shall constitute or effect a repayment, refinancing or novation of the amounts
evidenced by such original "Notes," but rather a modification and substitution
of their respective terms.

   2.03 Procedure for Borrowing.

      (a)   Revolving Loans. (i) Each Borrowing (other than a L/C Borrowing or a
Borrowing of Swing Line Loans) shall be made upon the Company's irrevocable
written notice delivered to the Agent in the form of a Notice of Borrowing
(which notice must be received by the Agent prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time)
(x) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case
of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) on the date of the requested Borrowing Date, in
the case of Base Rate Loans, specifying:

            (1)   the amount of the Borrowing, which shall be in an aggregate
      minimum amount of $500,000, or any multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof,
      in the case of Base Rate Loans, and $1,000,000, or any multiple of
      $500,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans;

            (2)   the requested Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day;

            (3)   the Type of Loans comprising the Borrowing; and

            (4)   the duration of the Interest Period applicable to such
      Eurodollar Rate Loans included in such notice. If the Notice of Borrowing
      fails to specify the duration of the Interest Period for any Borrowing
      comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Interest Period shall be one
      month;

provided, however, that with respect to the Borrowing to be made on the Closing
Date, the Notice of Borrowing shall be delivered to the Agent not later than
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Closing Date and such Borrowing will consist of
Base Rate Loans only.

      (ii)  The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of any
Notice of Borrowing and of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of that
Borrowing.

      (iii) Each Lender will make the amount of its Pro Rata Share of each
Borrowing available to the Agent for the account of the Company at the Agent's
Payment Office by 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date requested by
the Company in funds immediately available to the Agent. The proceeds of all
such Loans will then be made available to the Company by the Agent at such
office by crediting the account of the Company on the books of Bank of America
with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Agent by the Lenders and
in like funds as received by the Agent.

                                       29
<PAGE>

      (iv)  After giving effect to any Borrowing, unless the Agent shall
otherwise consent, there may not be more than seven different Interest Periods
in effect.

      (b)   Swing Line Loans. (i) The Company may borrow under the Swing Line
Loan Commitment on any Business Day until the Swing Line Termination Date;
provided that the Company shall give the Agent irrevocable written notice (which
notice must be received by the Agent prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago time)) and the
Agent shall promptly deliver to the Company and the Swing Line Bank a
confirmation of such notice specifying the amount of the requested Swing Line
Loan, which shall be in a minimum amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof. The proceeds of the Swing Line Loan will be made
available by the Swing Line Bank to the Company in immediately available funds
at the office of the Swing Line Bank by 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of
such notice. The Company may at any time and from time to time, prepay the Swing
Line Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, by notifying the
Agent prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago time) on any Business Day of the date and
amount of prepayment. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such
notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Partial
prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or a whole
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.

      (ii)  The Agent, acting upon the demand of the Swing Line Bank, at any
time in the Swing Line Bank's sole and absolute discretion, shall on behalf of
the Company (which hereby irrevocably directs the Agent to so act on its behalf)
notify each Lender (including the Swing Line Bank) to make a Revolving Loan to
the Company in a principal amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such Swing Line Loan, unless any Lender or Lenders shall be obligated,
pursuant to Section 2.01(a), to make funds available to the Agent on the date
such notice is given in an aggregate amount equal to or in excess of such Swing
Line Loan, in which case such funds shall be applied by the Agent first to repay
such Swing Line Loan and any remaining funds shall be made available to the
Company in accordance with Section 2.01(a); provided, however, that such notice
shall be deemed to have automatically been given upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default under Section 9.01(f) or (g). Upon notice from the Agent, following
any demand by the Swing Line Bank each Lender (other than the Swing Line Bank)
will immediately transfer to the Agent, for transfer to the Swing Line Bank, in
immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the amount of such Swing Line Loan so repaid. Each Lender's obligation to
transfer the amount of such Revolving Loan to the Agent shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without
limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender or any other Person may have against the Swing Line Bank, (ii)
the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the
termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment, (iii) any adverse change in the
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any other Person, (iv) any
breach of this Agreement by the Company or any other Person or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

      (iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Swing Line Bank
(i) shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loan if the conditions set
forth in Article V have not been satisfied and (ii) shall not make any requested
Swing Line Loan if, prior to 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of such
requested Swing Line Loan, it has received a written notice

                                       30
<PAGE>

from the Agent or any Lender directing it not to make further Swing Line Loans
because one or more of the conditions specified in Article V are not then
satisfied.

      (iv)  If prior to the making of a Loan required to be made by Section
2.03(b)(ii) an Event of Default described in Section 9.01(f) or 9.01(g) shall
have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Company, each Lender will,
on the date such Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice described in
Section 2.03(b)(ii), purchase an undivided participating interest in the
outstanding Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the
aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Each Lender
will immediately transfer to the Agent for the benefit of the Swing Line Bank,
in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation.

      (v)   Whenever, at any time after a Lender has purchased a participating
interest in a Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Bank receives any payment on
account thereof, the Swing Line Bank will distribute to the Agent for delivery
to each Lender its participating interest in such amount (appropriately
adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during
which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded);
provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swing
Line Bank is required to be returned, such Lender will return to the Agent for
delivery to the Swing Line Bank any portion thereof previously distributed by
the Swing Line Bank to it.

      (vi)  Each Lender's obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section
2.03(b)(ii) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section
2.03(b)(iv) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or the Company may have
against the Swing Line Bank, the Company or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of
Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Company, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the
Company, any Subsidiary or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

   2.04  Conversion and Continuation Elections.

      (a)   The Company may, upon irrevocable written notice to the Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.04:

            (i) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Loans
   (other than Swing Line Loans), or as of the last day of the applicable
   Interest Period, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, to convert any such
   Loans (or any part thereof in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000, or any
   multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and
   $1,000,000, or any multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, in the case of
   Eurodollar Rate Loans) into Loans of any other Type; or

            (ii) elect as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to
   continue any Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any part
   thereof in an amount not less than $1,000,000, or that is in an integral
   multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof);

                                       31
<PAGE>

provided, that if at any time the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans in
respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of
part thereof to be less than $1,000,000, such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
automatically convert into Base Rate Loans, and on and after such date the right
of the Company to continue such Loans as, and convert such Loans into,
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall terminate.

      (b)   The Company shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to be
received by the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least (i)
three (3) Business Days in advance of the Conversion/ Continuation Date, if the
Loans are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) on
the date of the Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted
into Base Rate Loans, specifying:

            (i) the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date;

            (ii) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or continued;

            (iii) the Type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion or
   continuation; and

            (iv) other than in the case of conversions into Base Rate Loans, the
   duration of the requested Interest Period.

      (c)   If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Company has failed to submit or complete a notice in
accordance with Section 2.04(b), the Company shall be deemed to have elected to
convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans into a one month Eurodollar Rate Loan,
provided, however, if any Default or Event of Default then exits, the Company
shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans into a
Base Rate Loan.

      (d)   The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, or, if no timely notice is provided by the
Company, the Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the details of any
automatic continuation or conversion. All conversions and continuations shall be
made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the
Loans, with respect to which the notice was given, held by each Lender.

      (e)   Unless the Majority Lenders otherwise consent, during the existence
of a Default or Event of Default, the Company may not elect to have a Loan
converted into or continued as an Eurodollar Rate Loan.

      (f)   After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of Eurodollar
Rate Loans, unless the Agent shall otherwise consent, there may not be more than
seven different Interest Periods in effect.

      (g)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Loans outstanding as of the
Closing Date and originally made pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement shall
continue to be of the same Type and shall have the same Interest Period as
established for such Loans under the Original Credit Agreement until converted
into a different Type pursuant to this Agreement or until such Interest Period
expires or such Loans are prepaid by the Company.

                                       32

   2.05 Voluntary Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Company may,
upon not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent,
terminate the Commitments, or permanently reduce the Commitments by an aggregate
minimum amount of $1,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
unless, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Revolving Loans
made on the effective date thereof, (i) the Effective Amount of all Revolving
Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations would exceed the amount of the
Commitments then in effect, (ii) the Effective Amount of all Swing Line Loans
then outstanding would exceed the Swing Line Loan Commitment or (iii) the
Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment. If and
to the extent specified by the Company in the notice to the Agent, some or all
of the reduction in the Commitments shall be applied to reduce the L/C
Commitment. Once reduced in accordance with this Section, the Commitments may
not be increased. Any reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to each
Lender according to its Pro Rata Share. All accrued Commitment Fees and letter
of credit fees to, but not including, the effective date of any reduction or
termination of the Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such
reduction or termination.

   2.06 Optional Prepayments. Subject to Section 4.04, the Company may, at any
time or from time to time, upon irrevocable notice to the Agent by 10:00 a.m.
(Chicago time), prepay Loans ratably among the Lenders in whole or in part
without penalty, in minimum amounts of $500,000, or any multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and $500,000, or any multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Such notice of
prepayment shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s)
of Loans to be prepaid. The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its
receipt of any such notice, and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall make such
prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to each
such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to Section
4.04.

   2.07 Mandatory Prepayments of Loans.

      (a)   The Company shall promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business
Days, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans or Swing
Line Loans on any date on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
such Loans together with the Effective Amount of the L/C Obligations (after
giving effect to any other repayments or prepayments on such day) exceeds the
aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment in the amount of such excess, or if any such
excess remains after a prepayment in full hereunder of all outstanding Loans,
the Company shall Cash Collateralize the outstanding Letters of Credit to the
extent of such remaining excess.

      (b)   If on any date the Effective Amount of L/C Obligations exceeds the
L/C Commitment, the Company shall Cash Collateralize on such date the
outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the excess of the maximum
amount then available to be drawn under the Letters of Credit over the Aggregate
L/C Commitment.

      (c)   General. Any prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be
applied first to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to Eurodollar
Rate Loans with the shortest Interest Periods remaining. The Company shall pay,
together with each prepayment

                                       33
<PAGE>

under this Section 2.07, accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts
required pursuant to Section 4.04.

   2.08 Repayment.

      (a)   Revolving Loans. The Company shall repay to the Lenders on the
Revolving Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
outstanding on such date.

      (b)   Swing Line Loans. The Company shall repay to the Swing Line Bank on
the Swing Line Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Swing Line
Loans outstanding on such date.

   2.09 Interest.

      (a)   Each Loan (other than Swing Line Loans) shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a
rate per annum equal to either the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate, as the case
may be, plus the Applicable Margin (and subject to the Company's right to
convert to other Types of Loans under Section 2.04). Swing Line Loans shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
Borrowing Date at a rate per annum equal to the Swing Line Rate.

      (b)   Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any prepayment of Loans
under Section 2.06 or 2.07 for the portion of the Loans so prepaid and upon
payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and, during the existence of any
Event of Default, interest shall be paid on demand of the Agent at the request
or with the consent of the Majority Lenders.

      (c)   Notwithstanding Section 2.09(a), while any Event of Default exists
or after acceleration, the Company shall pay interest (after as well as before
entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal
amount of all outstanding Obligations, at a rate per annum which is determined
by adding 2% per annum to the Applicable Margin then in effect for such Loans;
and in the case of Obligations not subject to an Applicable Margin, at a rate
per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2%; provided, however, that, on and after
the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan
outstanding on the date of occurrence of such Event of Default or acceleration,
the principal amount of such Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event
of Default or after acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate plus 2% (the "Default Rate").

      (d)   Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of
the Company to any Lender hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that
payments of interest shall not be required for any period for which interest is
computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for
or receiving such payment by such Lender would be contrary to the provisions of
any law applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate of interest that may
be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Lender, and in such
event the Company shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate permitted
by applicable law.

                                       34
<PAGE>

   2.10 Fees.

      (a)   Agency Fees. The Company shall pay the fees to the Agent for the
Agent's own account, as required by the letter agreement ("Fee Letter") among
the Company, the Arranger and the Agent, dated July 7, 2004.

      (b)   Commitment Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent for the account
of each Lender a commitment fee ("Commitment Fee") on the average daily unused
portion of such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, computed on a quarterly
basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter based upon
the daily utilization for that quarter as calculated by the Agent, at the
Applicable Margin per annum. For purposes of calculating utilization under this
Section, the Revolving Loan Commitment shall be deemed used to the extent of the
Effective Amount of Revolving Loans then outstanding, plus the Effective Amount
of L/C Obligations then outstanding but excluding for the purposes of
calculating utilization under this Section the Effective Amount of Swing Line
Loans. Such commitment fee shall accrue from the Closing Date to the Revolving
Termination Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each March, June, September and December through the Revolving
Termination Date, with the final payment to be made on the Revolving Termination
Date; provided that, in connection with any reduction or termination of
Revolving Loan Commitment under Section 2.05, the accrued commitment fee
calculated for the period ending on such date shall also be paid on the date of
such reduction or termination, with the following quarterly payment being
calculated on the basis of the period from such reduction or termination date to
such quarterly payment date. The commitment fees provided in this Section shall
accrue at all times after the above-mentioned commencement date, including at
any time during which one or more conditions in Article V are not met.

   2.11 Computation of Fees and Interest.

      (a)   All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate
is determined by Bank of America's "reference rate" shall be made on the basis
of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All
other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day
year and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if
computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest and fees shall accrue during
each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day
thereof to the last day thereof.

      (b)   Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent shall be
conclusive and binding on the Company and the Lenders and shall be prima facie
evidence of such interest rate. The Agent will, at the request of the Company or
any Lender, deliver to the Company or the Lender, as the case may be, a
statement showing the quotations used by the Agent in determining any interest
rate and the resulting interest rate.

                                       35

   2.12 Payments by the Company.

      (a)   All payments to be made by the Company shall be made without
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all payments by the Company shall be made to the Agent for the account
of the Lenders at the Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in dollars and
in immediately available funds, (i) solely for the purpose of calculating the
accrual of interest on the outstanding Obligations, no later than 12:00 Noon
(Chicago time) on the date specified herein and (ii) for all other purposes, no
later than 5:00 PM (Chicago time) on the date specified herein. The Agent will
promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share
as expressly provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received. Any
payment received by the Agent later than the time specified herein shall be
deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable
interest or fees shall continue to accrue for the day actually received.

      (b)   Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest
Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as
the case may be.

      (c)   Unless the Agent receives notice from the Company prior to the date
on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Company will not make such
payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the Company has
made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available
funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Company has not made such
payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand
such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date repaid.

   2.13 Payments by the Lenders to the Agent.

      (a)   Unless the Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the
Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing Date, at least
one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not
make available as and when required hereunder to the Agent for the account of
the Company the amount of that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the
Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to the Agent in
immediately available funds on the Borrowing Date and the Agent may (but shall
not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Lender
shall not have made its full amount available to the Agent in immediately
available funds and the Agent in such circumstances has made available to the
Company such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day following such
Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Agent, together with interest
at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period. A notice of the Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this clause (a)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available,
such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Lender's Loan on the date of
Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made
available to the Agent on the Business Day following the Borrowing

                                       36
<PAGE>

Date, the Agent will notify the Company of such failure to fund and, upon demand
by the Agent, the Company shall pay such amount to the Agent for the Agent's
account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of
such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the
time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

      (b)   The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date
shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
such Borrowing Date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on any Borrowing
Date.

   2.14 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share
contemplated hereunder), such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Agent of
such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the
Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the
purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each
other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid
therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to Section 11.10) with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of
such participation. The Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this
Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments.

                                  ARTICLE III

                              THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

   3.01 The Letter of Credit Subfacility.

      (a)   On the terms and conditions set forth herein (i) the Issuing Bank
agrees, (A) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date to issue Letters of Credit for
the account of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and to amend or
renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Sections
3.02(c) and (d), and (B) to honor drafts under the Letters of Credit; and (ii)
the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit Issued for the
account of the Company; provided, that the Issuing Bank shall not be obligated
to Issue, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in, any Letter of
Credit if as of the date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit (the "Issuance
Date") (1) the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans plus
the Effective Amount of all Revolving Loans exceeds the aggregate Revolving Loan
Commitment, (2) the participation of any Lender in the Effective Amount of all
L/C Obligations

                                       37
<PAGE>

and Swing Line Loans plus the Effective Amount of the Revolving Loans of such
Lender exceeds such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment or (3) the Effective
Amount of L/C Obligations exceeds the L/C Commitment. Within the foregoing
limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company's
ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and, accordingly,
the Company may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to
replace Letters of Credit which have expired or which have been drawn upon and
reimbursed.

      (b)   The Issuing Bank is under no obligation to Issue any Letter of
Credit if:

            (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
   arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank
   from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to
   the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force
   of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing
   Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the
   Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in
   particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter
   of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the
   Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the
   Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss,
   cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the
   Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it;

            (ii) the Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Lender,
   the Agent or the Company, on or prior to the Business Day prior to the
   requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one or more of the
   applicable conditions contained in Article V is not then satisfied;

            (iii) the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is after the
   Revolving Termination Date, unless the Company has Cash Collateralized, in
   form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, its L/C Obligations
   under such Letter of Credit on or prior to the date of the Issuance of such
   Letter of Credit;

            (iv) any requested Letter of Credit does not provide for drafts, or
   is not otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Issuing
   Bank, or the Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall violate any applicable
   policies of the Issuing Bank; or

            (v) such Letter of Credit is in a face amount less than $25,000,
   unless such lesser amount is approved by the Agent and the Issuing Bank, or
   is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars.

   3.02 Issuance, Amendment and Renewal of Letters of Credit.

      (a)   Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon the irrevocable written
request of the Company received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the
Company to the Agent) at least three (3) days (or such shorter time as the
Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to
the proposed date of issuance. Each such request for issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall be by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original writing, in
the form of a L/C Application, and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory
to the Issuing Bank: (i) the

                                       38
<PAGE>

 proposed date of issuance of the Letter of Credit
(which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the face amount of the Letter of Credit;
(iii) the expiry date of the Letter of Credit; (iv) the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be presented by the beneficiary of the
Letter of Credit in case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any
certificate to be presented by the beneficiary in case of any drawing
thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as the Issuing Bank may require.

      (b)   Prior to the Issuance of any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank will
confirm with the Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Agent has received
a copy of the L/C Application or L/C Amendment Application from the Company and,
if not, the Issuing Bank will provide the Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the
Issuing Bank has received notice on or before the Business Day on which the
Issuing Bank is to issue a requested Letter of Credit from the Agent (A)
directing the Issuing Bank not to issue such Letter of Credit because such
issuance is not then permitted under Section 3.01(a) as a result of the
limitations set forth in clauses (1) through (3) thereof or Section 3.01(b)(ii);
or (B) that one or more conditions specified in Article V are not then
satisfied; then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank
shall, with the written approval of the Agent, on the requested date, issue a
Letter of Credit for the account of the Company in accordance with the Issuing
Bank's usual and customary business practices.

      (c)   From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior
to the Revolving Termination Date, the Issuing Bank will, upon the written
request of the Company received by the Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the
Company to the Agent) at least three (3) days (or such shorter time as the
Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to
the proposed date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit issued by it. Each
such request for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile,
confirmed immediately in an original writing, made in the form of a L/C
Amendment Application and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed date of
amendment of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the
nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as the Issuing
Bank may require. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any
Letter of Credit if: (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time
to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms of this
Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of any such letter of Credit does not accept
the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. The Agent will promptly notify
the Lenders of the receipt by it of any L/C Application or L/C Amendment
Application.

      (d)   The Issuing Bank and the Lenders agree that, while a Letter of
Credit is outstanding and prior to the Revolving Termination Date, at the option
of the Company and upon the written request of the Company received by the
Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the Company to the Agent) at least five (5)
days (or such shorter time as the Issuing Bank may agree in a particular
instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of notification of
renewal, the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal
of any Letter of Credit issued by it. Each such request for renewal of a Letter
of Credit shall be made by facsimile, confirmed immediately in an original
writing, in the form of a L/C Amendment Application, and shall specify in form
and detail satisfactory to the Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be
renewed; (ii) the proposed date of notification of renewal of the Letter of
Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the revised expiry date of the
Letter of Credit; and (iv) such other matters as

                                       39
<PAGE>

the Issuing Bank may require. The Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation so
to renew any Letter of Credit if: (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation
at such time to issue or amend such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under
the terms of this Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit
does not accept the proposed renewal of the Letter of Credit. If any outstanding
Letter of Credit shall provide that it shall be automatically renewed unless the
beneficiary thereof receives notice from the Issuing Bank that such Letter of
Credit shall not be renewed, and if at the time of renewal the Issuing Bank
would be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit in
accordance with this clause (d) upon the request of the Company but the Issuing
Bank shall not have received any L/C Amendment Application from the Company with
respect to such renewal or other written direction by the Company with respect
thereto, the Issuing Bank shall nonetheless be permitted to allow such Letter of
Credit to renew, and the Company and the Lenders hereby authorize such renewal,
and, accordingly, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have received a L/C
Amendment Application from the Company requesting such renewal.

            (e) The Issuing Bank may, at its election (or as required by the
Agent at the direction of the Majority Lenders), deliver any notices of
termination or other communications to any Letter of Credit beneficiary or
transferee, and take any other action as necessary or appropriate, at any time
and from time to time, in order to cause the expiry date of such Letter of
Credit to be a date not later than the Revolving Termination Date.

            (f) This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict with
any L/C-Related Document (other than any Letter of Credit).

            (g) The Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Agent (and the Agent
shall deliver a copy to each Lender), concurrently or promptly following its
delivery of a Letter of Credit, or amendment to or renewal of a Letter of
Credit, to an advising lender or a beneficiary, a true and complete copy of each
such Letter of Credit or amendment to or renewal of a Letter of Credit.

      3.03 Risk Participations, Drawings and Reimbursements.

            (a) Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
purchase from the Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and each
drawing thereunder in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Pro Rata Share
of such Lender, times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. For purposes of
Section 2.10(b), each Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to utilize
the Commitment of each Lender by an amount equal to the amount of such
participation.

            (b) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of
Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Bank will promptly
notify the Company and the Agent. The Company shall reimburse the Issuing Bank
(by a L/C Borrowing or otherwise) prior to 12:00 Noon (Chicago time), on each
date that any amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
(each such date, an "Honor Date"), in an amount equal to the amount so paid by
the Issuing Bank. In the event the Company fails to reimburse the Issuing Bank
for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 Noon
(Chicago time) on the Honor

                                       40

<PAGE>

Date, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Agent and the Agent will
promptly notify each Lender thereof, and the Company shall be deemed to have
requested that Base Rate Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the unreimbursed
drawing be made by the Lenders to be disbursed on the Honor Date under such
Letter of Credit, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02. Any
notice given by the Issuing Bank or the Agent pursuant to this clause (b) may be
given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing (including by facsimile);
provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

            (c) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as Issuing Bank) shall
upon any notice pursuant to Section 3.03(b) make available to the Agent for the
account of the relevant Issuing Bank an amount in Dollars and in immediately
available funds equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount of the drawing,
whereupon the participating Lenders that so make funds available shall (subject
to Section 3.03(d)) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan consisting of a
Base Rate Loan to the Company in that amount. With respect to any unreimbursed
drawing that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Loan consisting of Base Rate
Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or
for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the
Issuing Bank a L/C Borrowing in the amount of the unreimbursed drawing that is
not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand by the
Agent or the Issuing Bank (together with interest) and shall bear interest at
the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the Agent for the
account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 3.03(c) shall be deemed
payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
constitute a L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation
obligation under this Section 3.03. Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan
or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 3.03(c) to reimburse the Issuing Bank
for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the
Issuing Bank. The Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Bank.
If any Lender so notified fails to make available to the Agent for the account
of the Issuing Bank the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of
the drawing by no later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Honor Date, then
interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, from the
Honor Date to the date on which such Lender makes such payment, at a rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time during such
period. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the
Agent) with respects to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of
the Honor Date, but failure of the Agent to give any such notice on the Honor
Date or in sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such
date shall not relieve such Lender from its obligations under this Section 3.03.

            (d) Each Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to
make the Revolving Loans or to fund its L/C Advances, as contemplated by this
Section 3.03, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, shall be
absolute and unconditional and without recourse to the Issuing Bank and shall
not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the
Issuing Bank, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii)
the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material
Adverse Effect; or (iii) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;

                                       41

<PAGE>

provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans under
this Section 3.03 (but not its obligation to fund L/C Advances) is subject to
the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than delivery by the Company of
a Borrowing Notice). No such making of a L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise
impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the
amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit,
together with interest as provided herein.

      3.04  Repayment of Participations.

            (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank of immediately available funds from the Company (i) in
reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under the Letter of Credit
with respect to which any Lender has paid the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank for such Lender's participation in the Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 3.03 or (ii) in payment of interest thereon, the Agent will pay to each
Lender, in the same funds as those received by the Agent for the account of the
Issuing Bank, the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such funds, and the
Issuing Bank shall receive the amount of the Pro Rata Share of such funds of any
Lender that did not so pay the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank.

            (b) If the Agent or the Issuing Bank is required at any time to
return to the Company, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any
official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by the
Company to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
3.04(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or
interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on demand of the Agent, forthwith
return to the Agent or the Issuing Bank the amount of its Pro Rata Share of any
amounts so returned by the Agent or the Issuing Bank plus interest thereon from
the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such
Lender to the Agent or the Issuing Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.

      3.05  Role of the Issuing Bank.

            (a) Each Lender and the Company agree that, in paying any drawing
under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to
obtain any document (other than any sight draft and certificates expressly
required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity
or accuracy of any such document which on its face appears valid or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.

            (b) No Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective
correspondents, participants or assignees of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to
any Lender for: (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the
request or with the approval of the Majority Lenders (or all of the Lenders, as
applicable under Section 11.01); (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,
effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any L/C-Related Document.

            (c) The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of
any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not,
preclude the Company's pursuing such rights

                                       42

<PAGE>

and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or
under any other agreement. No Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective
correspondents, participants or assignees of the Issuing Bank, shall be liable
or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of
Section 3.06; provided, however, anything in such clauses to the contrary
notwithstanding, that the Company may have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and
the Issuing Bank may be liable to the Company, to the extent, but only to the
extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages
suffered by the Company which the Company proves were caused by the Issuing
Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Bank's willful
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing: (i) the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their
face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, unless it
received a notice or information to the contrary; and (ii) the Issuing Bank
shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit
or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part,
which appear to be in order when presented.

      3.06 Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Company under this
Agreement and any L/C-Related Document to reimburse the Issuing Bank for a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, and to repay any L/C Borrowing and any drawing
under a Letter of Credit converted into Revolving Loans, shall be unconditional
and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and each such other L/C-Related Document under all circumstances,
including the following:

                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
      or any L/C-Related Document;

                  (ii) any permitted change in the time, manner or place of
      payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the
      Company in respect of any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or
      waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C-Related
      Documents;

                  (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
      right that the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company may have at any
      time against any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or
      any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
      acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with
      this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by the L/C-Related
      Documents or any unrelated transaction;

                  (iv) any draft, demand, certificate or other document
      presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
      invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
      untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
      transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
      drawing under any Letter of Credit;

                  (v) any payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
      against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
      comply with the terms of any

                                       43

<PAGE>

      Letter of Credit; or any permitted payment made by the Issuing Bank under
      any Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in
      bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
      liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any
      beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit, including any
      arising in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding;

                  (vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
      collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
      departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of
      the Company in respect of any Letter of Credit; or

                  (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
      or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
      that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of,
      the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company.

      3.07 Cash Collateral Pledge. Upon (i) the request of the Agent or the
Majority Lenders, (A) if the Issuing Bank has honored any full or partial
drawing request on any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in a L/C
Borrowing hereunder, or (B) if, as of the Revolving Termination Date, any
Letters of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly
undrawn, or (ii) the occurrence of the circumstances described in Section
2.07(b) requiring the Company to Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit, then, the
Company shall immediately Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount
equal to such L/C Obligations.

      3.08 Letter of Credit Fees.

            (a) The Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of each of
the Lenders a letter of credit fee with respect to the Letters of Credit equal
to the Applicable Margin per annum of the average daily maximum amount available
to be drawn of the outstanding Letters of Credit, computed on a quarterly basis
in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
based upon Letters of Credit outstanding for that quarter as calculated by the
Agent. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter during which Letters of Credit
are outstanding, commencing on the first such quarterly date to occur after the
Closing Date, through the Revolving Termination Date (or such later date upon
which the outstanding Letters of Credit shall expire), with the final payment to
be made on the Revolving Termination Date (or such later expiration date).

            (b) The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank a letter of credit
fronting fee for each Letter of Credit Issued by the Issuing Bank equal to
0.125% per annum of the face amount (or increased face amount, as the case may
be) of such Letter of Credit. Such Letter of Credit fronting fee shall be due
and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar
quarter during which such Letter of Credit is outstanding, commencing on the
first such quarterly date to occur after such Letter of Credit is issued,
through the Revolving Termination Date (or such later date upon which such
Letter of Credit shall expire), with the final payment to be made on the
Revolving Termination Date (or such later expiration date).

                                       44

<PAGE>

            (c) The Company shall pay to the Issuing Bank from time to time on
demand the normal issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees,
and other standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Bank relating to letters of
credit as from time to time in effect.

      3.09 Uniform Customs and Practice. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by
the Issuing Bank and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued (including
any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of
the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of
International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit,
and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,
as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce at the time
of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

      3.10 Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a
Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any
obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Company shall be
obligated to reimburse the Issuing Bank hereunder for any and all drawings under
such Letter of Credit. The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of
Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the
Company, and that the Company's business derives substantial benefits from the
businesses of such Subsidiaries.

      3.11 Outstanding Letters of Credit. The Existing Letters of Credit set
forth on Schedule 1.01 were issued prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the
Original Credit Agreement and will remain outstanding as of the Closing Date.
The Company, the Issuing Bank and each of the Lenders hereby agree with respect
to the Existing Letters of Credit that each such Existing Letter of Credit, for
all purposes under this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit
governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Lender further
agrees to participate in each such Existing Letter of Credit in an amount equal
to its Pro Rata Share of the stated amount of such Existing Letter of Credit.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

      4.01 Taxes.

            (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Company shall be required
by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes)
from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions
and (iii) the Company shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                                       45

<PAGE>

            (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Company. Without limiting the
provisions of subsection (a) above, the Company shall timely pay any Other Taxes
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify the
Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within ten (10) days after demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Agent, such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or the Issuing Bank
(with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment
of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority,
the Company shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent.

            (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Company is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such
jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), at the
time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Company or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if
requested by the Company or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent
as will enable the Company or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender
is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Company
is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall
deliver to the Company and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be
requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
request of the Company or the Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally
entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

                  (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
      W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which
      the United States is a party,

                  (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
      W-8ECI,

                                       46

<PAGE>

                  (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of
      the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x)
      a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank"
      within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent
      shareholder" of the Company within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of
      the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section
      881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
      Service Form W-8BEN, or

                  (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis
      for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal
      withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary
      documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company
      to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.

            (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund
of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by
the Company or with respect to which the Company has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Company an amount equal to such
refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts
paid, by the Company under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
the Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund), provided that the Company, upon the request of the
Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank
in the event the Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be
construed to require the Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available
its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems
confidential) to the Company or any other Person.

      4.02 Illegality.

            (a) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any
Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the
interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it
unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted
that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make
Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Lender to the Company
through the Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be suspended until the Lender notifies the Agent and the Company that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

            (b) If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Company shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact
and demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such
Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest
accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 4.04, either on the last day
of the Interest Period thereof, if the Lender may lawfully continue to maintain
such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Lender may not
lawfully continue to

                                       47

<PAGE>

maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If the Company is required to so prepay any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, then concurrently with such prepayment, the Company may
borrow from the affected Lender, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate
Loan.

            (c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Loans has been so terminated or suspended, the Company may elect, by giving
notice to the Lender through the Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be
made by the Lender as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans.

            (d) Before giving any notice to the Agent under this Section, the
affected Lender shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its
Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such
notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Lender, be
illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender.

      4.03 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.

            (a) If any Lender determines that, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation after the date of this Agreement or (ii) the compliance by that
Lender with any guideline or request after the date of this Agreement from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make
or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans (except for any such
reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), or
participating in Letters of Credit, or, in the case of the Issuing Bank, any
increase in the cost to the Issuing Bank of agreeing to issue, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining any unpaid drawing under any Letter of Credit, then the Company
shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand (with a copy of
such demand to be sent to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such
Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such
increased costs.

            (b) If any Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction of
any Capital Adequacy Regulation after the date of this Agreement, (ii) any
change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation after the date of this Agreement,
(iii) any change after the date of this Agreement in the interpretation or
administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other
Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Lender (or its Lending Office) or any
corporation controlling the Lender with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects
or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
the Lender or any corporation controlling the Lender and (taking into
consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to
capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that
the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitment,
loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such
Lender to the Company through the Agent, the Company shall pay to the Lender,
from time to time as specified by the Lender, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate the Lender for such increase.

                                       48

<PAGE>

      4.04 Funding Losses. The Company shall reimburse each Lender and hold each
Lender harmless from any loss or expense which the Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of:

            (i) the failure of the Company to make on a timely basis any payment
of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan;

            (ii) the failure of the Company to borrow a Loan, continue a
Eurodollar Rate Loan or convert a Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan after the
Company has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice
of Conversion/ Continuation;

            (iii) the failure of the Company to make any prepayment in
accordance with any notice delivered under Section 2.06;

            (iv) the prepayment (including pursuant to Section 2.07) or other
payment (including after acceleration thereof) of an Eurodollar Rate Loan on a
day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period;

            (v) the automatic conversion under Section 2.04 of any Eurodollar
Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant
Interest Period;

            (vi) any Buying Lender is deemed to have purchased a Eurodollar Rate
Loan bearing interest at a rate which is less than the prevailing rate of
interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans at the time of purchase in accordance with
Section 2.01(c); or

            (vii) any Selling Lender pursuant to Section 2.01(c) is deemed to
have sold a Eurodollar Rate Loan bearing interest at a rate which is higher than
the prevailing rate of interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans at the time of sale in
accordance with Section 2.01(c);

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Lenders under this
Section and under Section 4.03(a), each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a Lender
(and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be
conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Eurodollar Rate for such
Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank
eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether
or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan is in fact so funded.

      4.05 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Agent determines that for any
reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar
Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar
Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.09(a)
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate
Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding
such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent revokes such notice in
writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then

                                       49

<PAGE>

submitted by it. If the Company does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall
make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Company, in the amount
specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Company, but such Loans
shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar
Rate Loans.

      4.06 Certificates of Lenders. Any Lender claiming reimbursement or
compensation under this Article IV shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to
the Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable
to the Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on
the Company in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no amounts shall be payable by the Company
pursuant to Sections 4.03 or 4.04 with respect to any period commencing more
than one hundred eighty (180) days before the delivery of the certificate
contemplated by this Section 4.06 unless such amounts are claimed as a result of
the retroactive effect of any newly enacted or adopted law, rule or regulation
and such certificate is delivered within 180 days after such enactment or
adoption.

      4.07 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Company in this
Article IV shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

      4.08 Replacement of Lenders. Upon any Lender's making a claim for
compensation under Section 4.01 or 4.03, the Company may replace such Lender in
accordance with this Section. The Company may, upon notice to such Lender and
the Agent, replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign its Revolving
Loan Commitment (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Company in such
instance) pursuant to Section 11.08(a) to one or more other Lenders or Eligible
Assignees procured by the Company; provided, however, that if the Company elects
to exercise such right with respect to any Lender, it shall be obligated to
replace all Lenders that have made similar requests for compensation pursuant to
Section 4.01 or 4.03. The Lender shall have received payment in full all

Documents;

            (b) conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or

Obligation to which such Person is a party or any order, injunction, writ or
decree of any Governmental Authority to which such Person or its property is
subject; or

            (c) violate any material Requirement of Law.

      6.03 Governmental Authorization. No approval, consent, exemption,
authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any

or an extension of any amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the Code
has been made with respect to any Plan.

purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

and marketable title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real

effective to create, in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in all of the
collateral described therein; and the Collateral was delivered to the Collateral
Agent or its nominee in accordance with the terms thereof. The Lien of the
Pledge and Security Agreement constitutes a perfected, first priority security
interest other than Permitted Liens in all right, title and interest of the
Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in the Collateral described

the Collateral consisting of capital stock is not subject to any other Lien

create in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, a legal,

Collateral consisting of equity interests in the Company's Subsidiaries which
are first tier Foreign Subsidiaries (as defined in the Pledge and Security
Agreement), such pledge shall be limited to a pledge of 65% of the issued and
outstanding shares or other units of equity interests provided, however, if the
pledge of more sixty-five percent (65%) of such Foreign Subsidiary would not
result in materially adverse tax consequences to the pledgor under Section 956
of the Internal Revenue Code, or if such materially adverse tax consequences are
no longer effective, then such pledged equity interests shall constitute 100% or
such other percentage of issued and outstanding shares or other units of equity
interests of such Foreign Subsidiary and such Foreign Subsidiary shall execute
and deliver the applicable Collateral Documents. If any Excluded Subsidiary
shall cease to be an Excluded Subsidiary for any reason and to the extent any
Excluded Subsidiary may do so without violating federal, state or local laws or
regulations applicable to it, the Company shall promptly notify the Agent
thereof and such Subsidiary shall promptly execute and deliver the Collateral
Documents and all other instruments and documents necessary in the opinion of
the Agent to become a Guarantor and the Company shall cause such Subsidiary's
outstanding capital stock to be pledged to the Agent pursuant to the Collateral
Documents. The chief executive office and the principal books and records of the
Company and each Guarantor will be located at its address set forth on Exhibit A
to the Reaffirmation Agreement, and when financing statements have been filed in
the appropriate offices in the jurisdictions of organization for the Company and
the Guarantors and when such other actions as are each described in each of the
applicable Collateral Documents have been taken, the Collateral Documents shall

                                       57

<PAGE>

constitute a perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of
such Person, as the case may be, in the Collateral described therein, and except
for Permitted Liens existing on the Closing Date and those Liens whose priority
cannot be superseded by the provisions hereof or of any Collateral Document and
filings hereunder or thereunder, a perfected first lien on, and security
interest in, all right, title and interest of such Person, as the case may be,
in the Collateral, if any, described in each Collateral Document.

            (c) All representations and warranties of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries party thereto contained in the Collateral Documents are true and
correct.

Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act,
any state public utilities code, or any other Federal or state statute or
regulation limiting its ability to incur Indebtedness.

      6.15 No Burdensome Restrictions. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is

Company's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no significant unfair labor practice complaint is pending
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the best knowledge of the
Company, threatened against any of them before any Governmental Authority which
in any such case could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, contractual
franchises, authorizations and other material rights that are reasonably

with the rights of any other Person. To the best knowledge of the Company, no
slogan or other advertising device, product, process, method, substance, part or
other material now employed, or now contemplated to be employed, by the Company
or any Subsidiary infringes upon any rights held by any other Person, and no
claim or litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending or threatened,

other than those specifically disclosed in Part (A) of Schedule 6.19 hereto and
has no equity investments in any other corporation or entity other than those

considered appropriate means of mitigating and managing risks associated with
such matters and has not relied on any swap counterparty or any Affiliate of any
swap counterparty in determining whether to enter into any Swap Contract.

      6.23 Full Disclosure. None of the representations or warranties made by
the Company or any Subsidiary in the Loan Documents as of the date such
representations and warranties are made or deemed made, and none of the

the Loan Documents (including the offering and disclosure materials delivered by

any untrue statement of a material fact or omits any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading as of the time when

economic nature or matters of public knowledge that generally effect any of the
industry segments of the Company or its Subsidiaries); provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, the Company represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
be reasonable at the time. Any forward looking statements contained therein are
inherently subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted
with accuracy, and some of which might not be anticipated. Future events and
actual results, financial and otherwise, could differ materially from those set
forth therein or contemplated by the forward looking statements contained
therein.

      6.24 Intercompany Indebtedness. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
any intercompany Indebtedness which is evidenced by a promissory note, except
promissory notes which have been pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent

otherwise), it shall first (or substantially concurrently with such creation,
acquisition or capitalization) (a) (1) execute and deliver, and cause such
Subsidiary (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) to execute and deliver, to Agent a

extent, such Collateral consists of equity interests in a first tier Foreign
Subsidiary (as defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) the pledge of such
equity interests shall be limited to a pledge of 65% of the issued and
outstanding shares or other units of such equity interests (provided further,
however, if the pledge of more sixty-five percent (65%) of such Foreign
Subsidiary would not result in materially adverse tax consequences to the
pledgor under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code, and only to the extent
such materially adverse tax consequences remain effective, then such pledged
equity interest shall constitute 100% or such other percentage of issued and
outstanding shares or other units of equity interests of such Foreign
Subsidiary). If the foregoing materially adverse tax consequences should no
longer be effective, such Foreign Subsidiary shall execute the Collateral
Documents. If the Company or any Subsidiary, should acquire, create or
capitalize any new Subsidiary, the Company shall promptly notify the Agent
thereof and provided an updated Schedule 6.19 listing such new Subsidiary. If
any Excluded Subsidiary shall cease to be an Excluded Subsidiary for any reason
and to the extent any Excluded Subsidiary may do so without violating federal,
state or local laws or regulations applicable to it, the Company shall promptly
notify the Agent thereof and such Subsidiary shall promptly execute and deliver
the Collateral Documents and all other instruments and documents necessary in
the opinion of the Agent to become a Guarantor and the Company shall cause such
Subsidiary's outstanding capital stock to be pledged to the Agent pursuant to

                                   THE AGENT

      10.01 Appointment and Authorization; "Agent".

            (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 10.09)
appoints (or reaffirms its appointment under the Original Credit Agreement),
designates and authorizes the Agent (including, without limitation, in its
capacity as Collateral Agent) to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with
reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended
to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

            (b) The Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith
until such time and except for so long as the Agent may agree at the request of
the Majority Lenders to act for such Issuing Bank with respect thereto;
provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall have all of the benefits and
immunities (i) provided to the Agent in this Article X with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of
Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the application and
agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the Letters of Credit as fully as
if the term "Agent", as used in this Article X, included the Issuing Bank with
respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided in this
Agreement with respect to the Issuing Bank.

      10.02 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact

                                       78
<PAGE>

and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care.

      10.03 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be
liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or any officer thereof, contained in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any
other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

      10.04 Reliance by Agent.

            (a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the
Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority
Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

            (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Lender for consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to
or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lender.

      10.05 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with
respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to
be paid to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Agent shall have
received written notice from a Lender or the Company referring to

                                       79
<PAGE>

this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". The Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Lenders in
accordance with Article IX; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent
has received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest
of the Lenders.

      10.06 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no
act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable lender regulatory laws relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company and its Subsidiaries
hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession
of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

      10.07 Indemnification of Agent. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the
Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), pro rata,
from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any
portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company. The undertaking in
this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the
resignation or replacement of the Agent.

                                       80
<PAGE>

      10.08 Agent in Individual Capacity. Bank of America and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent or the
Issuing Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The
Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its
Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of the Company or such Subsidiary) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be
under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its
Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not
the Agent.

      10.09 Successor Agent. The Agent may, and at the request of the Majority
Lenders shall, resign as Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Lenders. If
the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Lenders shall appoint from
among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders which successor agent shall
be approved by the Company. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Lenders and the Company, a successor agent from among the
Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder,
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Article X and Sections 11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation,
the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until
such time, if any, as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided
for above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Bank of America may not be
removed as the Agent at the request of the Majority Lenders unless Bank of
America shall also simultaneously be replaced as "Issuing Bank" hereunder
pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank
of America.

      10.10 Withholding Tax.

            (a) [RESERVED].

            (b) If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN
and such Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise
transfers all or part of the Obligations of the Company to such Lender, such
Lender agrees to notify the Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no
longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of the Company to such Lender. To the
extent of such percentage amount, the Agent will treat such Lender's IRS Form
W-8BEN as no longer valid.

            (c) If any Lender claiming exemption from United States withholding
tax by filing IRS Form W-8ECI with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise

                                       81
<PAGE>

transfers all or part of the Obligations of the Company to such Lender, such
Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the
withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

            (d) If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such reduction. However, if the forms or other documentation required by clause
(a) of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by
Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction.

            (e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered
the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any
other reason) such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Lenders under this Section
shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement
of the Agent.

      10.11 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. The Lenders irrevocably authorize
the Collateral Agent, at its option and in its discretion:

            (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the
Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Revolving
Loan Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent
indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of
Credit, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any
sale permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) subject to
Section 11.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Majority
Lenders;

            (b) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by
the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such
property that is permitted by Sections 8.01(i), (j) or (l); and

            (c) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty
if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted
hereunder.

Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Majority Lenders will
confirm in writing the Collateral Agent's authority to release or subordinate
its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section
10.11.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      11.01 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by
the Company or any other Guarantor therefrom, shall be effective unless in
writing signed by the Majority Lenders and the Company or the applicable
Guarantor, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Agent, and each such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment,
waiver or consent shall:

5.01(e)) without the written consent of each Lender;

            (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate

directly affected thereby;

            (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (v) of the second
proviso to this Section 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or
under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the
Majority Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend the definition of "Default
Rate" or to waive any obligation of the Company to pay interest at the Default
Rate or (ii) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used
therein) if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest
on any Loan or L/C Borrowing or to reduce any fee payable hereunder; or

            (e) change Section 2.14 in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;

            (f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of
"Majority Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender

            (g) release any Guarantor (other than pursuant to this Agreement or
the Collateral Documents) from the Guaranty without the written consent of each
Lender or release the Agent's Liens and security interests in all or
substantially all of the Collateral except as otherwise may be provided in this
Agreement or in the Collateral Documents or except where the consent of the
Majority Lenders only is provided for;

and, provided further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and

                                       83
<PAGE>

signed by the Issuing Bank in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the
rights or duties of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement or any Letter of
Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by
it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
the Swing Line Bank in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights
or duties of the Swing Line Bank under this Agreement; (iii) no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent in addition
to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) Section 11.08(g) may not be
amended, waived or otherwise modified without the consent of each Granting
Lender all or any part of whose Loans are being funded by an SPC at the time of
such amendment, waiver or other modification; and (v) the Fee Letter may be
amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only
by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not
be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.

      11.02 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication.

            (a) Notices Generally. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except as

            11.02; and

            (b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to

not apply to notices to any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to Article II if
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, has notified the Agent that it
is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic
communication. The Agent or the Company may, in its discretion, agree to accept

requested" function, as available, return e-mail or other written

communications with the Agent may be recorded by the Agent, and each of the
parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

      11.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay
in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

      11.04 Costs and Expenses. The Company shall:

            (a) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are

Proceeding or appellate proceeding).

any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney
Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time (including at any
time following repayment of the Loans, the termination of the Letters of Credit
and the termination, resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of
any Lender) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person in
any way relating to or arising out of the Company entering into this Agreement
or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or
in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect to any

appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of any act or failure to act of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the
Loans or Letters of Credit the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any
Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that the Company shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other
Obligations.

      11.06 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that the Company makes a payment
to the Agent or the Lenders, or the Agent or the Lenders exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b)
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand its pro rata share
of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent. The obligations of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall
survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.

any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed
or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants
to the extent provided in Section 11.08 and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

      11.08 Assignments by Lenders.

            (a) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
purposes of this subsection (a), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing
Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender,
the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to
each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent or, if the "Trade
Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall
not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Agent, and so long as no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise
consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part
of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii)
shall not apply to rights in respect of Swing Line Loans; (iii) any assignment
of a Commitment must be approved by the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swing
Line Bank unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender
(whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible
Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to
acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to this Section 11.08,
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption,
the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under

                                       87
<PAGE>

this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.01, 4.03, 4.04, 11.04 and 11.05
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such assignment. Upon request, the Company (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 11.08(d).

            (b) Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent
of the Company, shall maintain at the Agent's Payment Office a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and the Company, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to
the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by each of the
Company and the Issuing Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent
for a material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any
Lender wishing to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request
and receive from the Agent a copy of the Register.

            (c) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Company or the Agent, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Company or any of the Company's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C
Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Agent, the Lenders
and the Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

      Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (d) of this
Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 4.01, 4.03 and 4.04 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.10 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14 as though it were a
Lender.

            (d) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Article IV than the applicable
Lender would have been

                                       88
<PAGE>

entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Company's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if
it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.01 unless
the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 4.01
and Section 10.10 as though it were a Lender.

            (e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

            (f) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution,"
"signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption
shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in
electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in
any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the Illinois Electronic Commerce Security Act, or any
other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

            (g) Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a
special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time
by the Granting Lender to the Agent and the Company (an "SPC") the option to
provide all or any part of any Revolving Loan that such Granting Lender would
otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Revolving
Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails
to make all or any part of such Revolving Loan, the Granting Lender shall be
obligated to make such Revolving Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by
any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise
increase or change the obligations of the Company under this Agreement
(including its obligations under Sections 4.01, 4.03 and 4.04), (ii) no SPC
shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender
shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record
hereunder. The making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the
Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Revolving
Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any
SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting
against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or
liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with
notice to, but without prior consent of the Company and the Agent

                                       89
<PAGE>

and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of
its right to receive payment with respect to any Revolving Loan to the Granting
Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information
relating to its funding of Revolving Loans to any rating agency, commercial
paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity
enhancement to such SPC.

            (h) Resignation as Issuing Bank or Swing Line Bank after Assignment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank
of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b)
above, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Company and
the Lenders, resign as Issuing Bank and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days' notice to
the Company, resign as Swing Line Bank. In the event of any such resignation as
Issuing Bank or Swing Line Bank, the Company shall be entitled to appoint from
among the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank or Swing Line Bank hereunder;
provided, however, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor
shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as Issuing Bank or Swing Line
Bank, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as Issuing Bank, it shall
retain all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank hereunder with respect
to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation
as Issuing Bank and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the
right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund risk
participations in pursuant to Section 3.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as
Swing Line Bank, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Bank provided
for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of
the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the
Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing
Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(ii).

      11.09 Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and the Lender agrees to take and
to cause its Affiliates to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise
due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as
"confidential" or "secret" by the Company and provided to it or to which it
otherwise is granted access by the Company or any Subsidiary, or by the Agent on
the Company's or such Subsidiary's behalf, under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such
information other than in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents or in connection with other business now or
hereafter existing or contemplated with the Company or any Subsidiary or to
disclose it to any third person; except to the extent such information (i) was
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by the Lender or the Agent, or (ii) was or becomes available on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided that such
source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company known to the
Lender or the Agent; provided, however, that any Lender or the Agent may
disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of
any Governmental Authority to which the Lender or the Agent is subject or in
connection with an examination of such Lender or the Agent by any such
authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (C) when required to
do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law;
(D) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or
proceeding to which the Agent, any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be
party; (E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of
any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Lender's or
the Agent's independent auditors and other professional advisors; (G) to any
Participant or Eligible Assignee, actual or

                                       90
<PAGE>

potential, provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep such information
confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders hereunder; (H) as to any
Lender the Agent or its respective Affiliate, as expressly permitted under the
terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Lender or such
Affiliate; and (I) to its Affiliates; provided that such Lender or the Agent
shall provide notice to the Company of any requirement to disclose to a person
who does not have an obligation to such Lender (or pursuant to applicable law or
applicable court order) to keep such information confidential (it being
understood and agreed that the failure to provide such notice shall not
constitute a violation by such Lender of this Section 11.09).

      11.10 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being waived by the Company
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of the Company against any and all Obligations owing to
such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Agent
or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document
and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees
promptly to notify the Company and the Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

      11.11 Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc. Each Lender shall
notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to
the Lender should be directed, of addresses of any Lending Office, of payment
instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such
other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request.

      11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

      11.13 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

      11.14 No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made and entered into
for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Lenders, the Agent
and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and
no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any
direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents.
