Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash
Collateral Account that the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, such funds
