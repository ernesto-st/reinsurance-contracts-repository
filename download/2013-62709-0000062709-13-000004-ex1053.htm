Accordingly, in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach of this Agreement by Executive, or Executive&#8217;s claim in a declaratory judgment action that all or part of this Agreement is unenforceable, the parties agree that the Company shall be entitled to the following particular forms of relief as a result of such breach, in addition to any remedies otherwise available to it at law or equity: (a) injunctions, both preliminary and permanent, enjoining or restraining such breach or anticipatory breach, and Executive hereby consents to the issuance thereof forthwith and without bond by any court of competent jurisdiction; and (b) recovery of all reasonable sums and costs, including attorneys&#8217; fees, expert witness fees, expenses and costs incurred by the Company to defend or enforce the provisions of this Agreement.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:4px;text-align:justify;text-indent:96px;font-size:11pt;"><font style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;">(c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event the Company is required to enforce any of its rights hereunder through legal proceedings, the parties acknowledge that it may be difficult or impossible to ascertain the precise amount of damages or lost profits incurred by the Company. Therefore, in the event of any breach by Executive of Section 3 of this Agreement, in addition to any other relief available to the Company at law or in equity, Executive agrees that the damages for each client lost in whole or in part by the Company as a result of my breach shall be two hundred percent (200%) of the gross commissions and fees received by the Company from such client during the twelve (12) months preceding the cessation of my employment. In arriving at this calculation, Executive agrees that the Company and Executive have considered the following factors: (i) the value of the clients; (ii) the business of the Company; (iii) the type and quality of the clients; (iv) the substantial amount of time, effort and expense incurred by the Company in acquiring, developing and maintaining the clients; (v) the number of years the Company typically retains such clients; (vi) the profitability of renewal business; and (vii) various other factors relating to the relationship between the Company and the clients.
