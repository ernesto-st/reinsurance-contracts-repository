Partner (acting directly or through its duly appointed agents), which is hereby
authorized and empowered on behalf and in the name of the Partnership, subject
to Section 2.2 and the other terms of this Agreement, to carry out any and all
of the objects and purposes of the Partnership and to perform all acts and enter
into and perform all contracts and other undertakings that it may in its sole
discretion deem necessary, advisable, convenient or incidental thereto. The
General Partner may exercise on behalf of the Partnership, and may delegate to
the Manager, all of the powers set forth in Section 1.6, PROVIDED, that the
management and the conduct of the activities of the Partnership shall remain the
sole responsibility of the General Partner and all decisions relating to the
selection and disposition of the Partnership's investments shall be made

General Partner is hereby authorized to appoint a successor general partner.

Partner and its duly appointed agents (including, without limitation, the

              2.5    LIABILITY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER AND THE MANAGER. (a)
GENERAL. Except as provided in the Partnership Law, the General Partner has the
powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a partner in a partnership
without limited partners (I) to the Partnership and the other Partners and (II)
to Persons other than the Partnership and the other Partners. No Covered Person
shall be liable to the Partnership or any Partner for any act or omission taken
or suffered by such Covered Person in good faith. No Partner shall be liable to
the Partnership or any Partner for any action taken by any other Partner. To the
extent that, at law or in equity, a Covered Person has duties and liabilities to
the Partnership or to the Partners, such Covered Person acting under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not be liable to the Partnership or any Partner for
its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of
this Agreement, to the extent they expressly restrict, replace or modify the
duties and liabilities of a Covered Person otherwise existing at law or in
equity, are agreed by the Partners to restrict, replace or modify such other
duties and liabilities of such Covered Person. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be liable for the
return of all or any portion of the Limited Partner's Capital Accounts or
Capital Contributions.

              (b)    RELIANCE. A Covered Person (I) shall incur no liability in
acting upon any signature or writing believed by it to be genuine, (II) may rely
on a certificate signed by an officer of any Person in order to ascertain any
fact with respect to such Person or within such Person's knowledge, and (III)
may rely on an opinion of counsel selected by such Covered Person with respect
to legal matters. Each Covered Person may act directly or through its agents or
attorneys. Each Covered Person may consult with counsel, appraisers, engineers,
accountants, actuaries, auditors and other skilled Persons of its choosing, and
shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith
reliance upon the advice of any of such Persons. No Covered Person shall be
liable to the Partnership or any Partner for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a responsible officer or officers of the Covered Person. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.5, no Covered Person shall be liable to the
Partnership or any Partner for any mistake of fact or judgment by the Covered
Person in conducting the affairs of the Partnership or otherwise acting in
respect of and within the scope of this Agreement. No Covered Person shall be
liable for the return to any Limited Partner of all or any portion of any
Limited Partner's Capital Account or Capital Contributions except as otherwise
provided herein.

              (c)    DISCRETION. Whenever in this Agreement the General Partner
or the Manager is permitted or required to make a decision (I) in its "sole
discretion" or "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority or latitude,
the General Partner or the Manager, as the case may be shall be entitled to
consider such interests and factors as it desires, including, without
limitation, its own interests, or (II) in its "good faith" or under another
expressed standard, the General

                                       7

<PAGE>


Partner or the Manager, as the case may be shall act under such express standard
and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this
Agreement or any other agreement or by relevant provisions of law or in equity
or otherwise. If any questions should arise with respect to the operation of the
Partnership, which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement
or the Partnership Law, or with respect to the interpretation of this Agreement,
the General Partner is hereby authorized to make a final determination with
respect to any such question and to interpret this Agreement in good faith, and
its determination and interpretation so made shall be final and binding on all
parties.

              2.6    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. (a) POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
While the Manager and the General Partner intend to avoid situations involving
conflicts of interest, each Limited Partner acknowledges that there may be
situations in which the interests of the Partnership, with respect to a
Portfolio Company or otherwise, may conflict with the interests of the General
Partner, a Senior Principal, the Manager or their respective Affiliates. Each
Limited Partner agrees that the activities of the General Partner, a Senior
Principal, the Manager, and their respective Affiliates not prohibited by this
Agreement may be engaged in by the General Partner, any Senior Principal, the
Manager or any such Affiliate, as the case may be, and will not, in any case or
in the aggregate, be deemed a breach of this Agreement or any duty owed by any
such Person to the Partnership or to any Partner.

              (b)    ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. On any issue involving actual
conflicts of interest not provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the
Manager and the General Partner will be guided by its good faith judgment as to
the best interests of the Partnership and shall take such actions as are
determined by the Manager and the General Partner, as the case may be, to be
necessary or appropriate to ameliorate any such conflict of interest and, in
addition, may take such actions as may be permitted or required under the
Institutional Fund Agreement. If the General Partner or the Manager takes an
action in respect of a matter giving rise to a conflict of interest, neither the
General Partner nor the Manager nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any liability to the Partnership or any Limited Partner for actions in
respect of such matter taken in good faith by them in the pursuit of their own
respective interests.

              2.7    TRANSFER OR WITHDRAWAL BY THE GENERAL PARTNER. To the
extent permitted by law,

              (a)    the General Partner may at its election convert to a
       limited partnership, limited liability company or other entity formed
       under the laws of the Cayman Islands or any other jurisdiction, or

                                       8

<PAGE>


              (b)    the General Partner may Transfer its interest as the
       general partner of the Partnership to, or be merged with and into, a
       limited partnership, limited liability company or other entity formed
       under the laws of the Cayman Islands or any other jurisdiction for the
       purpose of serving as the general partner of the Partnership,

but only if in any such case such conversion, Transfer or merger will not result
in a Material Adverse Effect on the Partnership or on the Limited Partners (in
their capacities as limited partners of the Partnership). Upon any such
conversion to such a limited partnership, limited liability company or other
entity, or any such Transfer by or merger of the General Partner to or with such
a limited partnership, limited liability company or other entity, such limited
partnership, limited liability company or other entity shall be deemed to be the
same Person as the General Partner for all purposes of this Agreement. All
Subscription Agreements applicable to the Partnership that are in effect at the
time of any such conversion, Transfer or merger shall thereafter continue in
full force and effect.

              2.8    CERTAIN OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. MMC, the General Partner, the
Manager, each Senior Principal, and any of their respective Affiliates, or any
subset of the foregoing, may organize or sponsor, private investment funds,
including, without limitation, funds having primary investment objectives and
policies substantially the same as those of the Partnership. Other than as
expressly contemplated herein, this Agreement shall not restrict or limit the
activities of MMC, the General Partner, the Manager, any Senior Principal or any
of their respective Affiliates.

                                    SECTION 3

                                LIMITED PARTNERS

              3.1    LIMITED PARTNERS. Limited Partners shall be divided into
groups as follows:

              (a)    "EMPLOYER LIMITED PARTNERS" shall be those Limited Partners
       designated as such in the Partnership Register.

              (b)    "PROFITS LIMITED PARTNERS" shall be those Limited Partners
       designated as such in the Partnership Register.

                                      Second Amended and Restated L.P. Agreement
<PAGE>


              (c)    "CASH LIMITED PARTNERS" shall be those Limited Partners
       designated as such in the Partnership Register.

The Associated Commitments of the Profits Limited Partners shall be associated
on the records of the Partnership with the Capital Commitment of the relevant
Employer Limited Partner.

              3.2    NO PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT, ETC. No Limited Partner, in
its capacity as a limited partner of the Partnership, shall take part in the
management or control of the Partnership's affairs, transact any business in the
Partnership's name or have the power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the
Partnership. No Limited Partner shall have the right to vote for the election,
removal or replacement of the General Partner. No provision of this Agreement
shall obligate any Limited Partner to refer investments to the Partnership or
restrict any investments that a Limited Partner may make.

              3.3    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Except as may otherwise be
provided by the Partnership Law or in Section 10.1(b) or Section 6.12 or
otherwise herein, the liability of a Limited Partner for any loss of the
Partnership shall not exceed the sum of (A) the amount of its Capital
Commitment, if any, (B) its interest in the undistributed assets of the
Partnership, (C) its obligation to make other payments expressly provided for in
this Agreement, and (D) its liability under any applicable law, including
without limitation the Partnership Law.

              3.4    NO PRIORITY, ETC. No Limited Partner shall have priority
over any other Limited Partner either as to the return of the amount of its
Capital Contribution to the Partnership or, except as provided in Section 6, as
to any allocation of income, gain, deduction or loss.

                                    SECTION 4

                                   INVESTMENTS

              4.1    INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. (a) CO-INVESTMENT. The
Partnership shall co-invest with the other Co-Investment Funds in a manner
determined in the sole discretion of the General Partner to be in accordance
with Section 4.7 of the Institutional Fund Agreement.

              (b)    REINVESTMENT. Proceeds from the disposition of Portfolio
Investments (I) may be reinvested by the General Partner to the same extent that
the general partner of the Institutional Fund is permitted by the Institutional
Fund Agreement to reinvest proceeds from the disposition of portfolio
investments of the Institutional Fund, and (II) subject to Section 5.5,

                                       10

                                            M&M Capital Professionals Fund, L.P.

may be retained and used to make Portfolio Investments if the General Partner,
in its sole discretion, determines that such retention and use would be
reasonable in light of the timing and size of anticipated Portfolio Investments.

              (c)    SPECIAL INVESTMENT VEHICLE. If the General Partner
determines for legal, tax, regulatory or other reasons that it is appropriate
for any or all of the Partners to participate in one or more investments, each
of which would be a Portfolio Investment if it were made by the Partnership,
through an entity other than the Partnership, the General Partner may structure
the making of such investment or investments outside of the Partnership by
requiring each such Partner, subject to Section 5.2, to contribute capital to an
alternative entity (each, a "SPECIAL INVESTMENT VEHICLE") that, in lieu of the
Partnership, will invest in such investment or investments. In such event, (I)
each such Partner shall make a capital commitment directly to such Special
Investment Vehicle, subject to Section 5.2, and such capital commitment shall
reduce the Capital Commitments of such Partner to the same extent, and (II) each
Limited Partner shall participate in the Special Investment Vehicle pursuant to
the Power of Attorney executed by such Limited Partner, and documentation with
respect to such Special Investment Vehicle shall be executed and delivered on
behalf of each such Limited Partner by the General Partner pursuant to such
Power of Attorney. The economic terms of the organizational documents of any
Special Investment Vehicle will be substantially similar in all material
respects to those of the Partnership.

              4.2    TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. The General Partner may invest funds
held by the Partnership in Temporary Investments pending investment in Portfolio
Investments, pending distribution or for any other purpose.


                                    SECTION 5

                   CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; CAPITAL COMMITMENTS

              5.1    CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE
PARTNERS. (a) CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
Partner (other than the Profits Limited Partners) shall make Capital
Contributions to the Partnership in the aggregate amount of the Capital
Commitment of such Partner as set forth opposite its name in the Partnership
Register, PROVIDED that, except as otherwise provided herein, the Partners
(other than the Profits Limited Partners) shall make such Capital Contributions
to the Partnership (I) in respect of Portfolio Investments, PRO RATA based on
the Capital Commitments or Remaining Capital Commitments, as determined with
respect to each Portfolio Investment by the General Partner

<PAGE>


in its sole discretion, of all the Partners (other than Defaulting Cash Limited
Partners and Limited Partners (including, without limitation, an Employer
Limited Partner in respect of an associated Profits Limited Partner) excused
from making such a Capital Contribution pursuant to Section 5.2), and (II) in
respect of Organizational Expenses and Partnership Expenses, PRO RATA based on
the Capital Commitments of all the Partners (other than Defaulting Cash Limited
Partners), and PROVIDED FURTHER that in respect of each Partner, such Partner's
aggregate Capital Contributions shall not exceed such Partner's Capital
Commitment.

              (b)    DRAWDOWNS. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Capital
Contributions of each Partner (other than the Profits Limited Partners), shall
be paid in separate Drawdowns, subject to the following terms and conditions:

              (i)    The General Partner shall provide each Employer Limited
       Partner and each Cash Limited Partner with a notice (as the same may be
       revised by the General Partner in its sole discretion, the "DRAWDOWN
       NOTICE") at least 3 days prior to the date of Drawdown. Each such Partner
       shall pay to the Partnership the Capital Contribution of such Partner as
       specified in the Drawdown Notice, in cash or other immediately available
       funds by the date of Drawdown specified in the Drawdown Notice.

              (ii)   Subject to Section 5.2, each Limited Partner (other than
       the Profits Limited Partners) shall pay to the Partnership the Capital
       Contribution of such Partner in respect of Portfolio Investments,
       Partnership Expenses or Organizational Expenses, as the case may be, as
       specified in the Drawdown Notice (as the same may be revised), in cash or
       other immediately available funds by the date of Drawdown specified in
       the Drawdown Notice.

              (iii)  Each Capital Contribution by an Employer Limited Partner in
       respect of a Capital Commitment shall be associated on the records of the
       Partnership with the Profits Limited Partner with which such Capital
       Commitment is associated.

              (c)    CREDITORS. The provisions of this Section 5.1 are intended
solely to benefit the Partners and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, shall not be construed as conferring any benefit upon any
creditor of the Partnership (and no such creditor shall be a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement), and no Partner shall have any duty or obligation
to any creditor of the Partnership to make any Capital Contributions or to cause
the General Partner to deliver a Drawdown Notice.

                                       12

<PAGE>


              5.2    EXCUSED INVESTMENTS. The General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, excuse, in whole or in part, any Limited Partner from participation
in any Portfolio Investment if the General Partner, in its sole discretion, has
determined that any such participation (I) may constitute a conflict of interest
for such Limited Partner, the Partnership or any other Co-Investment Fund, (II)
may subject such Limited Partner, the Partnership or any other Co-Investment
Fund to a material tax or material regulatory requirement to which it or they
would not otherwise be subject, or which is reasonably likely to materially
increase any such material tax or material regulatory requirement beyond what it
would otherwise have been, or (III) may cause a Material Adverse Effect. In the
event that, pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the General Partner
excuses a Profits Limited Partner with respect to participation in a Portfolio
Investment, the Associated Contribution of the Employer Limited Partner
associated with such Profits Limited Partner shall be excused. For the avoidance
of doubt, there will be no reduction in the Remaining Associated Commitment of
an Employer Limited Partner with respect to an excused Profits Limited Partner
associated with such Employer Limited Partner.

              5.3    DEFAULTING LIMITED PARTNERS. (a) CASH LIMITED PARTNERS. If
any Cash Limited Partner fails to contribute, in a timely manner, any portion of
the Capital Commitment required to be contributed by such Cash Limited Partner
hereunder or pursuant to such Cash Limited Partner's Subscription Agreement, or
any portion of the amounts determined pursuant to Section 10.1 to be required to
be contributed by such Cash Limited Partner, and any such failure continues for
ten Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof from the General
Partner (a "CASH LIMITED PARTNER DEFAULT"), then such Cash Limited Partner (a
"DEFAULTING CASH LIMITED PARTNER") may be designated by the General Partner as
in default and shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this Section
5.3. The General Partner may choose not to designate any such Cash Limited
Partner as a Defaulting Cash Limited Partner and may agree to waive or permit
the cure of all or part of any default by such Defaulting Cash Limited Partner,
subject to such conditions as the General Partner and the Defaulting Cash
Limited Partner may agree upon. In the event that a Cash Limited Partner becomes
a Defaulting Cash Limited Partner, (I) such a Defaulting Cash Limited Partner's
Remaining Capital Commitment (the "DEFAULTED COMMITMENTS") shall be deemed to be
zero (except that the General Partner, the Employer Limited Partners and the
Cash Limited Partners that are not Defaulting Cash Limited Partners shall have
an option, exercisable within ten Business Days following the date of the notice
referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.3(a), to assume the
Defaulted Commitments, if any, of the Defaulting Cash Limited Partner, such
Defaulted Commitments to be assumed in proportion to the Capital Commitments
and/or Associated Commitments, as the case may be, of the Partners exercising
such option (the "EXERCISING PARTNERS")), (II) such Defaulting Cash Limited
Partner shall be entitled to receive only one-half of the distributions that it
would have been entitled to receive had it not become a Defaulting Cash Limited
Partner, and the other

<PAGE>


one-half of such distributions (the "FORFEITED DISTRIBUTIONS") shall be made in
accordance with this Section 5.3(a), and (III) such Defaulting Cash Limited
Partner shall not have a right to receive any distributions with respect to any
Portfolio Investment for which such Defaulting Cash Limited Partner failed to
contribute when due any portion of such Defaulting Cash Limited Partner's
Capital Commitment or any Portfolio Investment made on or after such date. The
Forfeited Distributions of a Defaulting Cash Limited Partner pursuant to this
Section 5.3(a) shall be applied as follows when and as amounts become
distributable: FIRST, to the Partnership in an amount equal to the
Organizational Expenses and Partnership Expenses, in each case as estimated in
good faith by the Manager, attributable to such Defaulting Cash Limited
Partner's Capital Commitment for the period from the date of Cash Limited
Partner Default through the end of the Term, and SECOND, to the Exercising
Partners in accordance with the respective Capital Commitments and/or Associated
Commitments, as the case may be, of such Partners, or, if there are no
Exercising Partners, to all Partners other than any Limited Partner, Cash
Limited Partner, or Profits Limited Partner in default in accordance with their
respective Capital Commitments and/or Associated Commitments, as the case may
be. In addition, such Defaulting Cash Limited Partner shall contribute to the
Partnership an amount equal to the contribution, if any, that such Defaulting
Cash Limited Partner would be required to make to the Partnership pursuant to
Section 6.11(d), Section 6.12 or Section 10.1(b) if all of the assets of the
Partnership were liquidated as of the date of Cash Limited Partner Default for
their Value and all of the liabilities of the Partnership were satisfied in
accordance with their terms and the Partnership was dissolved in accordance with
Section 13. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.3(a), the
obligations of any Defaulting Cash Limited Partner to the Partnership hereunder
shall not be extinguished as a result of the operation of this Section 5.3(a).
The General Partner shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to pursue all
remedies at law or in equity available to it with respect to the default of a
Defaulting Cash Limited Partner.

              (b)    PROFITS LIMITED PARTNERS. If any Profits Limited Partner
(A) fails to make, in a timely manner, any contributions required to be made by
such Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.12 or Section 10.1(b), or (B) fails
to defer compensation at the time and in the amount required by the M&M Capital
Plan, and any such failure continues for ten Business Days after receipt of
written notice thereof from the General Partner (a "PROFITS LIMITED PARTNER
DEFAULT"), then such Limited Partner (a "DEFAULTING PROFITS LIMITED PARTNER")
may be designated by the General Partner as in default and shall thereafter be
subject to the provisions of this Section 5.3(b). To the extent permitted by the
M&M Capital Plan, the General Partner may choose not to designate any Profits
Limited Partner as a Defaulting Profits Limited Partner and may agree to waive
or permit the cure of all or part of any default by such Defaulting Profits
Limited Partner, subject to such conditions as the General Partner and the
Defaulting Profits Limited Partner may agree upon. Except as may be otherwise
provided in this Agreement, in

<PAGE>


the event that a Profits Limited Partner becomes a Defaulting Profits Limited
Partner, (I) such a Defaulting Profits Limited Partner's interest in the
Partnership attributable to such Defaulting Profits Limited Partner's unfunded
deferral under the M&M Capital Plan would be purchased by the relevant Employer
Limited Partner or its designee for $1.00, and (II) such Defaulting Profits
Limited Partner shall not have a right to receive any distributions with respect
to any Portfolio Investment made on or after the date on which such Defaulting
Profits Limited Partner failed to make deferrals when due under the M&M Capital
Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, amounts deferred pursuant to the M&M Capital
Plan by a Profits Limited Partner but not yet invested in Portfolio Investments
at the time of a Profits Limited Partner Default by such Profits Limited Partner
shall not be invested in Portfolio Investments. In addition, such Defaulting
Profits Limited Partner shall contribute to the Partnership an amount equal to
the contribution, if any, that such Defaulting Profits Limited Partner would be
required to make to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.12 or Section 10.1(b)
if all of the assets of the Partnership were liquidated as of the date of
Profits Limited Partner Default for their Value and all of the liabilities of
the Partnership were satisfied in accordance with their terms and the
Partnership was dissolved in accordance with Section 13, and such Defaulting
Profits Limited Partner's contribution in respect of Section 6.12 shall be
distributed to its associated Employer Limited Partner. In addition, the
Defaulting Profits Limited Partner may be required to purchase the portion of
the interest of its associated Employer Limited Partner in the Partnership
attributable to any outstanding Advance made by such Employer Limited Partner,
in accordance with the provisions of sections 8.2 and 8.3 of the M&M Capital
Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.3(b), the
obligations of any Defaulting Profits Limited Partner to the Partnership
hereunder shall not be extinguished as a result of the operation of this Section
5.3(b). The General Partner shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
pursue all remedies at law or in equity available to it with respect to the
Profits Limited Partner Default of a Defaulting Profits Limited Partner.

              5.4    TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT (OTHER THAN TIER 1 LIMITED
PARTNERS). (a) TERMINATION IN THE EVENT OF DEATH, TOTAL DISABILITY OR
RETIREMENT. If a Cash Limited Partner (other than a Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner)
or a Profits Limited Partner (other than a Tier 1 Profits Limited Partner) dies
or is terminated as an employee or consultant of an Employer Limited Partner by
reason of such Limited Partner's Total Disability or Retirement, such Cash
Limited Partner or Profits Limited Partner shall retain his or her interest in
the Partnership, PROVIDED that such Limited Partner or his or her estate or
legal representative may at any time request that the General Partner (or in the
case of a Profits Limited Partner, the Employer Limited Partner associated with
such terminated Profits Limited Partner) purchase, or designate a purchaser for,
all or a portion of the interest in the Partnership of such Limited Partner, and
in the case of a Cash Limited Partner, terminate such Cash Limited Partner's

obligation to make future Capital Contributions to the Partnership in respect of
its Capital Commitment to fund Portfolio Investments made after the date of such
request. The General Partner and the affected Employer Limited Partner may grant
any such request in whole or in part, but have no obligation to grant any such
request. If the General Partner or the affected Employer Limited Partner grants
the request that an interest be purchased, the General Partner or the affected
Employer Limited Partner, as the case may be, or such Person's designee, shall
provide notice no later than 90 days after such request is made and shall pay to
such Limited Partner an amount equal to the Value of such Limited Partner's
interest in the Partnership (or a greater amount agreed to by the General
Partner or the Employer Limited Partner, as the case may be) within 60 days of
such notice. In addition, unless the General Partner in its sole discretion
determines otherwise, such terminated Cash Limited Partner or Profits Limited
Partner shall contribute to the Partnership (or the Partnership shall withhold
from distributions otherwise due to such Cash Limited Partner or Profits Limited
Partner) an amount equal to the contribution, if any, that such terminated
Limited Partner would be required to make to the Partnership pursuant to Section
6.11(d), Section 6.12 or Section 10.1(b) if all of the assets of the Partnership
were liquidated as of the date of termination for their Value and all of the
liabilities of the Partnership were satisfied in accordance with their terms and
the Partnership was dissolved in accordance with Section 13. Without
duplication, the obligations of such terminated Limited Partner pursuant to
Section 6.11(d), Section 6.12 and Section 10.1(b) shall survive with the same
effect as if such terminated Limited Partner had retained its interest in the
Partnership.

              (b)    OTHER TERMINATION. If a Cash Limited Partner (other than a
Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner) or a Profits Limited Partner (other than a Tier 1
Profits Limited Partner) is terminated as an employee of or consultant to an
Employer Limited Partner for a reason other than death, Total Disability or
Retirement, the General Partner (or in the case of such a terminated Profits
Limited Partner, the Employer Limited Partner associated with such terminated
Profits Limited Partner) will have the right, but not the obligation, to
purchase or designate a purchaser for the interest in the Partnership of such
Limited Partner at any time after such termination. If such termination is an
involuntary termination without an M&M Capital Cause Determination or is a
voluntary termination, the purchase price for such Limited Partner's interest
shall be the fair market value of such interest, which shall be as mutually
agreed by the parties, provided that in the absence of such agreement, fair
market value shall be determined by an independent appraiser selected by the
General Partner (or the Employer Limited Partner, as the case may be) and
approved by the Limited Partner, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The cost of such appraisal shall be shared equally by the General
Partner (or the Employer Limited Partner, as the case may be) and the Limited
Partner. If the employment of a Limited Partner is terminated due to an
involuntary termination with an M&M Capital Cause

                                       16

Determination, the purchase price for such Limited Partner's interest in the
Partnership shall be the lesser of (I) an amount equal to the aggregate Capital
Contributions made by such Limited Partner to the Partnership, (II) the Value of
such interest or (III) the fair market value of such interest determined by an
independent appraiser selected by the General Partner (or the Employer Limited
Partner, as the case may be). Fair market value as of any date shall be
determined as if the Partnership had been liquidated in an orderly manner as of
such date. Upon any such purchase of a Limited Partner's interest in the
Partnership, such Limited Partner shall have no further interest in the
Partnership. In the absence of any such purchase of a Limited Partner's interest
in the Partnership, such Limited Partner shall remain a Limited Partner in the
Partnership and shall remain subject to all provisions of this Agreement,
PROVIDED that such Limited Partner shall have no rights under Section 8.2(b). In
addition, unless the General Partner in its sole discretion determines
otherwise, the obligation of such a terminated Cash Limited Partner to make
further Capital Contributions to the Partnership in respect of his or her
Capital Commitment to fund Portfolio Investments made after the date of such
Cash Limited Partner's termination will terminate, PROVIDED that if such
obligation is not to be so terminated, notice that such obligation will continue
will be given to such Cash Limited Partner within 180 days of the termination of
employment of such Cash Limited Partner. In addition, unless the General Partner
in its sole discretion determines otherwise, such terminated Cash Limited
Partner or Profits Limited Partner shall contribute to the Partnership (or the
Partnership shall withhold from distributions otherwise due to such Cash Limited
Partner or Profits Limited Partner) an amount equal to the contribution, if any,
that such terminated Limited Partner would be required to make to the
Partnership pursuant to Section 6.11(d), Section 6.12 or Section 10.1(b) if all
of the assets of the Partnership were liquidated as of the date of termination
for their Value and all of the liabilities of the Partnership were satisfied in
accordance with their terms and the Partnership was dissolved in accordance with
Section 13. Without duplication, the obligations of such terminated Limited
Partner pursuant to Section 6.11(d), Section 6.12 and Section 10.1(b) shall
survive with the same effect as if such terminated Limited Partner had retained
its interest in the Partnership.

              5.5    TERMINATION OF A TIER 1 LIMITED PARTNER. (a) TERMINATION IN
THE EVENT OF DEATH, TOTAL DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT. If a Tier 1 Limited Partner
dies or is terminated as an employee of or consultant to an Employer Limited
Partner by reason of such Tier 1 Limited Partner's Total Disability or
Retirement, such Tier 1 Limited Partner shall retain his or her interest in the
Partnership, PROVIDED that such Tier 1 Limited Partner or his or her estate or
legal representative may at any time request that the General Partner (or in the
case of a Tier 1 Profits Limited Partner, its associated Employer Limited
Partner) purchase or designate a purchaser for, all or a portion of the interest
in the Partnership of such Tier 1 Limited Partner. The General Partner and the
affected Employer Limited Partner may grant such request in

                                       17

                                            M&M Capital Professionals Fund, L.P.

<PAGE>


whole or in part, but have no obligation to do so. If the General Partner or the
affected Employer Limited Partner grants the request that an interest be
purchased, the General Partner or the affected Employer Limited Partner, as the
case may be, or such Person's designee shall provide notice no later than 90
days after such request is made, and shall pay to such Limited Partner an amount
equal to the Value of such Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership within
60 days of such notice. In addition, a Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner or his or her
estate or legal representative may elect to terminate such Tier 1 Cash Limited
Partner's obligation to make future Capital Contributions to the Partnership, in
respect of any amount of his or her Capital Commitment which exceeds $2.5
million, to fund Portfolio Investments made after the date of such election. The
obligations of such terminated Limited Partner pursuant to Section 6.11(d),
Section 6.12 and Section 10.1(b) shall survive with the same effect as if such
terminated Limited Partner had retained its interest in the Partnership.

              (b)    OTHER TERMINATION. If a Tier 1 Limited Partner is
terminated as an employee or consultant for a reason other than death, Total
Disability or Retirement, the General Partner (or in the case of a Tier 1
Profits Limited Partner, the Employer Limited Partner associated with such Tier
1 Profits Limited Partner) may, but only with the consent of such Tier 1 Limited
Partner, purchase or designate a purchaser for the interest in the Partnership
of such Tier 1 Limited Partner at a purchase price that is mutually agreed upon
but which shall not be less than the Value of such interest. In addition, unless
both the General Partner and a terminated Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner agree
otherwise, the Remaining Capital Commitments of such Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner
shall be reduced to zero and such terminated Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner shall
have no further obligation to make Capital Contributions to the Partnership.
Without duplication, the obligations of such terminated Tier 1 Cash Limited
Partner pursuant to Section 6.11(d), Section 6.12, and Section 10.1(b), as
applicable, shall survive with the same effect as if such terminated Limited
Partner had retained its interest in the Partnership. Upon termination of the
employment of a Tier 1 Limited Partner, such Tier 1 Limited Partner or
representative thereof, can require (I) that Distributable Cash apportioned to
such Tier 1 Limited Partner be distributed promptly, and (II) that proceeds from
the disposition of Portfolio Investments apportioned to such Limited Partner
shall not be reinvested pursuant to Section 4.1(b).

              (c)    COMMITMENTS. In the event the Capital Commitments of any
Tier 1 Cash Limited Partner are reduced pursuant to Section 5.5, the Employer
Limited Partner will assume such Capital Commitments to the extent required to
ensure that the Capital Commitments of the Tier 1 Cash Limited Partners,
aggregated with the Capital Commitments of the Employer Limited Partner
associated with the Tier 1 Profits Limited Partners and with the capital
commitments of the Senior Principals and their estate planning vehicles to
Trident Capital II, L.P., equal at least $20 million.

              5.6    SPECIAL CONSEQUENCES OF TERMINATION OF ANY PROFITS LIMITED
PARTNER. If, for any reason, a Profits Limited Partner is terminated as an
employee of or consultant to its associated Employer Limited Partner, there are
additional consequences as set forth in the M&M Capital Plan. Such Profits
Limited Partner will have an interest only in Portfolio Investments that were
made during the period when the Profits Limited Partner made deferrals when due
under the M&M Capital Plan. The Employer Limited Partner associated with such
terminated Profits Limited Partner will purchase the portion of such Profits
Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership attributable to such terminated
Profits Limited Partner's unpaid deferral under the M&M Capital Plan for $1.00,
and such terminated Profits Limited Partner's obligation to make further
deferrals under the M&M Capital Plan will be reduced to zero. If, at the time
the employment of a Profits Limited Partner with M&M Capital is terminated, (I)
such Profits Limited Partner has not deferred an amount under the M&M Capital
Plan at least equal to the amount of such Profits Limited Partner's Associated
Commitment, and (II) the amount, if any, of the Capital Contributions of such
Employer Limited Partner in respect of the associated Profits Limited Partner's
interest in the Partnership exceeds the amount such Profits Limited Partner has
deferred under the M&M Capital Plan, then such Employer Limited Partner may, in
its discretion, require the Profits Limited Partner to purchase, for cash, the
portion of such Employer Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership
attributable to such excess Capital Contributions of such Employer Limited
Partner in accordance with the provisions of sections 8.2 and 8.3 of the M&M
Capital Plan.

              5.7    FURTHER ACTIONS. To the extent necessary in the sole
discretion of the General Partner, the General Partner shall cause this
Agreement to be amended, without the need for any further act, vote or approval
of any other Partner or Person, to reflect as appropriate the occurrence of any
of the transactions referred to in this Section 5 or in Section 11 as promptly
as is practicable after such occurrence.

                                    SECTION 6

            CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATIONS; WITHHOLDING

              6.1    CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. There shall be established on the books
and records of the Partnership a capital account (a "CAPITAL ACCOUNT") for each
Partner.

              6.2    ADJUSTMENTS TO CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. As of the last day of each
Period, the balance in each Partner's Capital Account shall be adjusted by (A)
increasing such balance by (I) such Partner's allocable share of each item of
the Partnership's income and gain for such

                                       19

<PAGE>


Period (allocated in accordance with Section 6.9) and (II) the Capital
Contributions, if any, made by such Partner during such Period and (B)
decreasing such balance by (I) the amount of cash or the Value of Securities or
other property distributed or deemed distributed to such Partner pursuant to
Section 6 or Section 8 and (II) such Partner's allocable share of each item of
the Partnership's deduction or loss for such Period (allocated in accordance
with Section 6.10). Each Partner's Capital Account shall be further adjusted
with respect to any special allocations or adjustments pursuant to this
Agreement.

              6.3    DISTRIBUTIONS. Distributable Cash attributable to any
Portfolio Investment shall initially be apportioned among the Partners in
proportion to their Sharing Percentages for such Portfolio Investment.
Distributable Cash not attributable to a Portfolio Investment shall be
apportioned among the Partners (other than the Employer Limited Partners) in
proportion to their respective Capital Contributions giving rise to the
Distributable Cash (or, in the case of a Profits Limited Partner, the Capital
Contributions of the Employer Limited Partner associated with such Profits
Limited Partner). Except as otherwise provided herein, Distributable Cash
apportioned to the General Partner shall be distributed to the General Partner
and Distributable Cash apportioned to a Cash Limited Partner shall be
distributed to such Cash Limited Partner. Except as otherwise provided herein,
Distributable Cash apportioned to a Profits Limited Partner shall be distributed
as follows:

                     FIRST, 100% to the Employer Limited Partner associated with
       such Profits Limited Partner until the cumulative amount distributed to
       such Employer Limited Partner in respect of such Profits Limited Partner
       pursuant to this paragraph First is equal to the sum of (I) the aggregate
       Capital Contributions of such Employer Limited Partner associated with
       such Profits Limited Partner used to fund the cost of such Portfolio
       Investment and each other Portfolio Investment previously disposed of, or
       used to fund Partnership Expenses and Organizational Expenses, and (II)
       such additional amount as is necessary to provide such Employer Limited
       Partner with a rate of return on such Capital Contributions equal to the
       AFR Rate (such sum, the "AFR RETURN"); and

                     SECOND, to such Profits Limited Partner.

              6.4    TAX DISTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding Section 6.3, the
Partnership may, either prior to, together with or subsequent to any
distribution of Distributable Cash pursuant to Section 6.3 with respect to a
Portfolio Investment, make distributions to all Partners (other than any
Defaulting Cash Limited Partners or Defaulting Profits Limited Partners),
regardless of their tax status, in amounts intended to enable such Partners (or
any Person whose tax liability is determined by reference to the income of any
such Partner) to discharge their United States

<PAGE>


federal, state and local (and, in the discretion, of the General Partner,
non-U.S.) income tax liabilities arising from the allocations and distributions
made (or to be made) pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Portfolio
Investment. The amount distributable pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be
determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion, taking into account
the maximum combined United States federal, New York State and New York City tax
rates applicable to individuals or corporations (whichever is higher) on
ordinary income and capital gain (taking into account the applicable holding
period), as the case may be, and the amounts of ordinary income and capital gain
allocated to the Partners pursuant to this Agreement, and otherwise based on
such reasonable assumptions as the General Partner determines in good faith to
be appropriate (and the assumptions described in this sentence shall be applied
equally to each Partner regardless of its tax status). The amount distributable
to any Partner pursuant to any clause of Section 6.3 shall be reduced by the
amount distributed to such Partner pursuant to this Section 6.4, and the amount
so distributed under this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to have been distributed
to the extent of such reduction pursuant to such clause of Section 6.3 for
purposes of making the calculations required by Section 6.3.

              6.5    OTHER PROVISIONS. (a) AVAILABLE ASSETS. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, distributions shall be made only to the
extent of Available Assets and in compliance with the Partnership Law.

              (b)    DISPOSITION OF PORTION OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT. If less
than all of the Portfolio Investments in a Portfolio Company are disposed of by
the Partnership, the portion disposed of and the portion retained shall for
purposes of Sections 6 and 10 (including for purposes of applying the
definitions used therein) be deemed to be two separate Portfolio Investments.
Any Capital Contributions, allocations or distributions made with respect to
such Portfolio Investment shall be allocated between the portion disposed of and
the portion retained PRO RATA in proportion to their respective purchase prices.

              (c)    DEFERRAL OF DISTRIBUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUTSTANDING
ADVANCES. Notwithstanding paragraph Second of Section 6.3, if an Employer
Limited Partner shall have notified the Partnership that, pursuant to the M&M
Capital Plan, an Advance has been made to any Profits Limited Partner associated
with such Employer Limited Partner, then an amount equal to the amount of such
Advance shall be retained in the Partnership and not distributed to such Profits
Limited Partner until such Employer Limited Partner shall have notified the
Partnership that the Advance is no longer outstanding, at which time such amount
(together with any earnings thereon) shall be distributed to such Profits
Limited Partner. Any amount so withheld shall be invested by the Partnership in
Temporary Investments for the account of the holder of such Profits Limited
Partner.

<PAGE>


              6.6    DISTRIBUTIONS OF SECURITIES. Except in connection with the
dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership as provided in Section 13, the
General Partner shall not make any distributions in kind except to the extent
the general partner of the Institutional Fund is permitted to make distributions
in kind as provided in the Institutional Fund Agreement and as set forth herein.
In the event that a distribution of Securities is made, such Securities shall be
deemed to have been sold at their Value and the proceeds of such sale shall be
deemed to have been distributed to the Partners for all purposes of this
Agreement.

              6.7    NEGATIVE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. Except as provided by Section
6.12, no Limited Partner shall, and except as otherwise required by law the
General Partner shall not, be required to make up a negative balance in its
Capital Account.

              6.8    NO WITHDRAWAL OF CAPITAL. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, no Partner shall have the right to withdraw capital from the
Partnership or to receive any distribution of or return on such Partner's
Capital Contributions.

              6.9    ALLOCATIONS. Each item of income, gain, loss and deduction
of the Partnership (determined in accordance with U.S. tax principles as applied
to the maintenance of capital accounts) shall be allocated among the Capital
Accounts of the Partners with respect to each Period as of the end of such
Period in a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect to the
provisions of Sections 6 and 13 and the other relevant provisions of this
Agreement.

              6.10   TAX MATTERS. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
income, gains, losses, credits and deductions recognized by the Partnership
shall be allocated among the Partners, for United States federal, state and
local income tax purposes, to the extent permitted under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations, in the same manner that each such item is allocated to the
Partners' Capital Accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner
shall have the power in its sole discretion to make such allocations for United
States federal, state and local income tax purposes as may be necessary to
maintain substantial economic effect, or to insure that such allocations are in
accordance with the interests of the Partners in the Partnership, in each case
within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Tax credits shall
be allocated in good faith by the General Partner. All matters concerning
allocations for United States federal, state and local and non-U.S. income tax
purposes, including, without limitation, accounting procedures, not expressly
provided for by the terms of this Agreement shall be determined in good faith by
the General Partner. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, cause the
Partnership to make the election under section 754 of the Code. The General
Partner is hereby designated as the "tax matters partner" of the Partnership, as

                                       22

                                            M&M Capital Professionals Fund, L.P.

<PAGE>


provided in the Treasury Regulations pursuant to section 6231 of the Code (and
any similar provisions under any other state or local or non-U.S. tax laws).
Each Partner hereby consents to such designation and agrees that upon the
request of the General Partner it will execute, certify, acknowledge, deliver,
swear to, file and record at the appropriate public offices such documents as
may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such consent. Either the General
Partner shall have executed and filed a U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8832
prior to the date hereof electing to classify the Partnership as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 301.7701-3 of the
Treasury Regulations as of a date no later than the date hereof, or the General
Partner shall timely execute and file such Form 8832 on or after the date hereof
electing to classify the Partnership as a partnership for United States federal
income tax purposes as of a date no later than the date hereof, and the General
Partner is hereby authorized to execute and file such Form for all of the
Partners. The General Partner shall not subsequently elect to change such
classification. The General Partner is hereby authorized to execute and file for
all of the Partners any comparable form or document required by any applicable
United States state or local tax law in order for the Partnership to be
classified as a partnership under such tax law. The Partnership shall not
participate in the establishment of an "established securities market" (within
the meaning of section 1.7704-1(b) of the Treasury Regulations) or a "secondary
market or the substantial equivalent thereof" (within the meaning of section
1.7704-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations) or, in either case, the inclusion of
interests in the Partnership thereon.

              6.11   WITHHOLDING TAXES. (a) AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD; TREATMENT OF
WITHHELD TAX. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold and to pay over, or
otherwise pay, any withholding or other taxes payable by the Partnership or any
of its Affiliates (pursuant to the Code or any provision of United States
federal, state, or local or non-U.S. tax law) with respect to such Partner or as
a result of such Partner's participation in the Partnership (including as a
result of a distribution in kind). If and to the extent that the Partnership
shall be required to withhold or pay any such withholding or other taxes, such
Partner shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have received a
payment from the Partnership as of the time such withholding or other tax is
required to be paid, which payment shall be deemed to be a distribution of
Distributable Cash pursuant to the relevant clause of Section 6.3 with respect
to such Partner's interest in the Partnership to the extent that such Partner
(or any successor to such Partner's interest in the Partnership) would have
received a cash distribution but for such withholding. To the extent that such
deemed payment exceeds the cash distribution that such Partner would have
received at such time but for such withholding, the General Partner shall notify
such Partner as to the amount of such excess and such Partner shall make a
prompt payment to the Partnership of such amount by wire transfer. The
Partnership may hold back from any distribution in kind

<PAGE>


property having a Value equal to the amount of taxes withheld or otherwise paid
until the Partnership has received such payment.

              (b)    WITHHOLDING TAX RATE. Any withholdings referred to in this
Section 6.11 shall be made at the maximum applicable statutory rate under the
applicable tax law unless the General Partner shall have received an opinion of
counsel or other evidence, satisfactory to the General Partner, to the effect
that a lower rate is applicable, or that no withholding is applicable.

              (c)    WITHHOLDING FROM DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARTNERSHIP. In the
event that the Partnership receives a distribution from or in respect of which
tax has been withheld, the Partnership shall be deemed to have received cash in
an amount equal to the amount of such withheld tax, and each Partner shall be
deemed to have received as a distribution of Distributable Cash pursuant to the
relevant clause of Section 6.3 the portion of such amount that is attributable
to such Partner's interest in the Partnership as equitably determined by the
General Partner.

              (d)    INDEMNIFICATION. Each Partner shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and the
General Partner against all claims, liabilities and expenses of whatever nature
relating to the Partnership's or the General Partner's obligation to withhold
and to pay over, or otherwise pay, any withholding or other taxes payable by the
Partnership or the General Partner as a result of such Partner's participation
in the Partnership. In addition, the Partnership shall, hereby or pursuant to a
separate indemnification agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless each Portfolio Company and any other
Covered Person who is or who is deemed to be the responsible withholding agent
for United States federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax purposes (other
than any Covered Person that is indemnified by each Partner pursuant to the
previous sentence) against all claims, liabilities and expenses of whatever
nature relating to such Portfolio Company's or Covered Person's obligation to
withhold and to pay over, or otherwise pay, any withholding or other taxes
payable by such Portfolio Company or Covered Person, as the case may be, as a
result of the participation in the Partnership of a Partner (other than such
Covered Person). If, pursuant to a separate indemnification agreement or
otherwise, the Partnership shall indemnify or be required to indemnify any
Portfolio Company or Covered Person against any claims, liabilities or expenses
of whatever nature relating to such Portfolio Company's or Covered Person's
obligation to withhold and to pay over, or otherwise pay, any withholding or
other taxes payable by such Portfolio Company or Covered Person as a result of
any Partner's participation in the Partnership, such Partner shall pay to the
Partnership the amount of the indemnity paid or required to be paid.

the dissolution of the Partnership, prior to the application of this Section
6.12, the aggregate amount distributed pursuant to Section 6 or Section 13 to an
Employer Limited Partner with respect to any Profits Limited Partner associated
with such Employer Limited Partner is not sufficient to provide the AFR Return
attributable to such Profits Limited Partner, such Profits Limited Partner shall
contribute to the Partnership an amount that equals the amount of such shortfall
and the Partnership shall, subject to Section 6.11 and applicable law,

              6.13   FINAL DISTRIBUTION. The final distributions following

                       INDEMNIFICATION OF COVERED PERSONS

              10.1   INDEMNIFICATION OF COVERED PERSONS, ETC. (a)
INDEMNIFICATION GENERALLY. The Partnership and each Partner shall, and hereby
does, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, hold
harmless and release each Covered Person from and against all claims, demands,
liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, losses, suits, proceedings and actions,
whether judicial, administrative, investigative or otherwise, of whatever
nature, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated ("CLAIMS"), that may accrue
to or be incurred by any Covered Person, or in which any Covered Person may
become involved, as a party or otherwise, or with which any Covered Person may
be threatened, relating to or arising out of the business and affairs of, or
activities undertaken in connection with, the Partnership (including, but not
limited to, Claims arising out of the disposition of any Portfolio Company), or
otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines
or penalties, and counsel fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation for or defense or disposition of any investigation, action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding (a "PROCEEDING"), whether civil or criminal (all
of such Claims and amounts covered by this Section 10.1, and all expenses
referred to in Section 10.2, referred to as "DAMAGES"), except to the extent
that it shall have been determined ultimately by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Damages arose primarily from the Disabling Conduct of
such Covered Person. The termination of any Proceeding by settlement shall not,
of itself, create a presumption that such Covered Person has engaged in
Disabling Conduct or any Damages relating to such settlement arose primarily
from the Disabling Conduct of any Covered Person. The provisions of this Section
10 shall survive the termination, dissolution and winding-up of the Partnership.

              (b)    CONTRIBUTION. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, at any time and from time to time and prior to the third anniversary
of the last day of the Term, the General Partner may require the Partners to
contribute to the Partnership an amount sufficient to satisfy all or any portion
of the indemnification obligations of the Partnership pursuant to Section
10.1(a), whether such obligations arise before or after the last day of the
Term, or with respect to any Person who is a Partner, before or after such
Person ceases to be a Partner,

                                      Second Amended and Restated L.P. Agreement
<PAGE>


PROVIDED that each Partner shall make such contributions in respect of its share
of any such indemnification obligations made or required to be made as follows:

              (i)    if the Claims or Damages so indemnified against arise out
       of a Portfolio Investment by each Partner to which Distributable Cash was
       distributed in connection with such Portfolio Investment, in such amounts
       as shall result in each Partner retaining from such Distributable Cash
       the amount that would have been distributed to such Partner had the
       amount of Distributable Cash been, at the time of such distribution,
       reduced by the amount of such indemnification obligations, as equitably
       determined by the General Partner, and

              (ii)   in any other circumstances, by the Partners (other than the
       Employer Limited Partners) in proportion to their Capital Commitments
       and/or Associated Commitments, as the case may be.

Any distributions returned pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) shall not be treated
as Capital Contributions, but shall be treated as returns of distributions and
reductions in Distributable Cash, in making subsequent distributions pursuant
to Sections 6.3 and 13.2. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10 to the
contrary, a Partner's liability under the first sentence of this Section 10.1(b)
is limited to an amount equal to the sum of all distributions received by such
Partner from the Partnership. Nothing in this Section 10.1(b), express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to give any Person other than the
Partnership or the Partners any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
or in respect of this Section 10.1(b) or any provision contained herein.

              (c)    NO DIRECT LIMITED PARTNER INDEMNITY. Limited Partners shall
not be required directly to indemnify any Covered Person under this Section
10.1.

              10.2   EXPENSES, ETC. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, expenses incurred by a Covered Person in defense or settlement
of any Claim that may be subject to a right of indemnification hereunder shall
be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final disposition thereof upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay such
amount if it shall be determined ultimately by a court of competent jurisdiction
that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder. The right
of any Covered Person to the indemnification provided herein shall be cumulative
with, and in addition to, any and all rights to which such Covered Person may
otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law or equity and shall
extend to such Covered Person's successors, assigns and legal representatives.
All judgments against the Partnership, and all judgments against the

<PAGE>


Partnership and either or both of the General Partner and/or the Manager in
respect of which the General Partner and/or the Manager are/is entitled to
indemnification, shall first be satisfied from Partnership assets (including,
without limitation, Capital Contributions and any payments under Section
10.1(b)), before the General Partner or the Manager, as the case may be, is
responsible therefor.

              10.3   NOTICES OF CLAIMS, ETC. Promptly after receipt by a Covered
Person of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, such Covered Person
shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against
the Partnership, give written notice to the Partnership of the commencement of
such Proceeding, PROVIDED that the failure of any Covered Person to give notice
as provided herein shall not relieve the Partnership of its obligations under
this Section 10, except to the extent that the Partnership is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such Proceeding is
brought against a Covered Person (other than a derivative suit in right of the
Partnership), the Partnership shall be entitled to participate in and to assume
the defense thereof to the extent that the Partnership may wish, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Covered Person. After notice from the
Partnership to such Covered Person of the Partnership's election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the Partnership shall not be liable for expenses
subsequently incurred by such Covered Person in connection with the defense
thereof. The Partnership shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Covered Person of a release from all
liability in respect to such Claim.

              10.4   NO WAIVER. Nothing contained in this Section 10 shall
constitute a waiver by any Partner of any right that it may have against any
party under United States federal or state securities, Cayman Islands or other
non-U.S. laws.

              10.5   RETURN OF DISTRIBUTIONS. At any time for a period of three
years after the last day of the Term, each Person who was a Partner (other than
an Employer Limited Partner) shall severally indemnify and hold harmless each
Covered Person for such Partner's ratable share of Damages (based on the
aggregate distributions received directly or indirectly by all Partners), on the
same terms and, to the same extent and with the same limitations as if such
indemnity were given by the Partnership pursuant to Section 10.1(a) but without
regard to Section 10.1(b), Section 10.2, or Section 10.3. The aggregate amount
of a Partner's obligations under this Section 10.5 shall not exceed the amount
of distributions from the Partnership theretofore received by such Partner.

              10.6   INDEMNIFICATION OF COVERED PERSONS. The General Partner is
hereby instructed to cause the Partnership to indemnify, hold harmless and
release each Covered Person, and authorized to cause the Partnership to
indemnify, hold harmless and release any other Person, in each case pursuant to
a separate indemnification agreement and on such terms as it may in its absolute
discretion deem appropriate. It is the express intention of the parties hereto
that (A) the provisions of this Section 10 for the indemnification of Covered
Persons may be relied upon by such Covered Persons and may be enforced by such
Covered Persons (or by the General Partner on behalf of any such Covered Person,
PROVIDED that the General Partner shall not have any obligation to so act for or
on behalf of any such Covered Person) against the Partnership and the Partners
pursuant to this Agreement or to a separate indemnification agreement, as if
such Covered Persons were parties hereto, and (B) notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 16.7, the term "gross negligence" shall have the meaning given such
term under the laws of the State of Delaware.

the Partnership.

              (b)    CONDITIONS TO TRANSFER. Any purported Transfer by a Limited

       incurred by the Partnership or the General Partner on behalf of the
       Partnership in connection therewith;

              (iv)   the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, require
       any Limited Partner wishing to make a Transfer under this Section 11 or
       such Transferee to pay to the Partnership such amount in immediately
       available funds as is sufficient to cover all expenses incurred by or on
       behalf of the Partnership in connection with such substitution or
       Transfer, and in connection therewith, to execute and deliver such
       documents, instruments, certificates and opinions of counsel as the

              (vii)  such Transfer will not be effected on or through an
       "established securities market" or a "secondary market or the substantial
       equivalent thereof," as such terms are used in section 1.7704-1 of the

       (taking into account section 1.7704-1(h)(3) of the Treasury Regulations).

The General Partner may waive any or all of the conditions set forth in this
Section 11.1(b) (other than clause (vii) hereof) if in its sole discretion, it

       provisions of, the Securities Act or any applicable state or non-U.S.
       securities laws;

              (ii)   will not require the General Partner or the Partnership to
       register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; and,
       as required by the General Partner, that the Transferee is a Person that
       counts as one beneficial owner for purposes of section 3(c)(1) of the
       Investment Company Act;

              (iii)  will not require the Manager, the General Partner or any
       Affiliate of the Manager or the General Partner that is not registered
       under the Investment Advisers Act or the Partnership to register as an
       investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act;

              (iv)   will not cause the Partnership to be taxable as corporation
       under the Code; and

              (v)    will not violate the laws, rules or regulation of any state
       or the rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority applicable to
       such Transfer.

In giving such opinion, counsel may, with the consent of the General Partner,
rely as to factual matters on certificates of the Transferor, the Transferee and
the General Partner.

              (d)    DEATH, INCAPACITY ETC. Subject to Sections 11.1(a), 11.1(b)
and 11.1(c), the estate of a Limited Partner who is a natural person shall have
the right to Transfer, upon the death, incompetency, bankruptcy, withdrawal or
incapacity of such Limited Partner, his or her interest in the Partnership.

              (e)    SUBSTITUTE LIMITED PARTNERS. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, any Transferee of a Transferor's interest in the
Partnership pursuant to the terms of this Section 11 may be admitted to the
Partnership as a substitute limited partner of the Partnership (a "SUBSTITUTE
LIMITED PARTNER") only with the consent of the General Partner, which consent
may be withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner. Upon
the admission of such Transferee as a Substitute Limited Partner, all references
herein to such Transferor shall be deemed to apply to such Substitute Limited
Partner, and such Substitute Limited Partner shall succeed to all rights and
obligations of the Transferor hereunder. A Person shall be deemed admitted to
the Partnership as a Substitute Limited Partner at the time that the foregoing
conditions are satisfied and such Person is listed as a limited partner of the
Partnership in the Partnership Register. Any Transferee of an economic interest
in the Partnership shall become a Substitute Limited Partner only upon
satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section 11.1.

              (f)    TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF AGREEMENT NOT RECOGNIZED. No
attempted Transfer or substitution shall be recognized by the Partnership and
any purported Transfer or substitution shall be void unless effected in
accordance with and as permitted by this Agreement.

              11.2   ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNERS. (a) CONDITIONS TO ADMISSION.
In addition to the admission of Limited Partners at the Initial Closing, the
General Partner, in its sole discretion, may schedule, from time to time, one or
more additional Closings for one or more Person or Persons seeking admission to
the Partnership as an additional limited partner of the Partnership (each such
Person, an "ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNER", which term shall include any Person
that is a Partner immediately prior to such additional Closing and that wishes
to increase the amount of such Person's Capital Commitment or, in the case of a
Profits Limited Partner, its Associated Commitment), subject to the deter
mination by the General Partner in the exercise of its good faith judgment that
in the case of each such admission or increase the following conditions have
been satisfied:

              (i)    Each such Additional Limited Partner shall have executed
       and delivered such instruments and shall have taken such actions as the
       General Partner shall deem necessary, convenient or desirable to effect
       such admission or increase, including, without limitation, the execution
       of (A) a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which such Additional

                                      Second Amended and Restated L.P. Agreement
<PAGE>


       Limited Partner agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions hereof or
       (if such Additional Limited Partner is a Cash Limited Partner or an
       Employer Limited Partner) to increase the amount of such Limited
       Partner's Capital Commitment, as the case may be and (B) a Power of
       Attorney.

              (ii)   Such admission or such increase shall not result in a
       violation of any applicable law, including, without limitation, Cayman
       Islands and United States federal and state securities laws, or any term
       or condition of this Agreement and, as a result of such admission or such
       increase, the Partnership shall not be required to register as an
       Investment Company under the Investment Company Act or any law of similar
       import of the Cayman Islands; none of the General Partner, the Manager or
       any Affiliate of the General Partner or Manager would be required to
       register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act or
       any law of similar import of the Cayman Islands; and the Partnership
       shall not become taxable as a corporation or association.

              (a)    On the date of its admission to the Partnership or the date
of such increase, as the case may be, such Additional Limited Partner shall have
paid or unconditionally agreed to pay to the Partnership, an amount equal to the
sum of

              (i)    in the case of each Portfolio Investment then held by the
       Partnership, the percentage of such Additional Limited Partner's Capital
       Commitment or (if the Additional Limited Partner is increasing its
       Capital Commitment) the percentage of the amount of the increase of such
       Additional Limited Partner's Capital Commitment that is equal to a
       fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the aggregate of the Capital
       Contributions of the previously admitted Partners used to fund the cost
       of such Portfolio Investment and (2) the denominator of which is the sum
       of the aggregate of (X) the Capital Commitments of the previously
       admitted Partners that made Capital Contributions used to fund the cost
       of such Portfolio Investment and (Y) (without duplication) the Capital
       Commitments of all Additional Limited Partners, and

              (ii)   the percentage of such Additional Limited Partner's Capital
       Commitment or (if such Additional Limited Partner is increasing its
       Capital Commitment) the percentage of the amount of the increase of such
       Additional Limited Partner's Capital Commitment that is equal to a
       fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the aggregate of the Capital
       Contributions of the previously admitted Limited Partners in respect of
       all Drawdowns which have theretofore been funded and not returned to the
       Partners, other than Drawdowns made and used to fund the cost of a
       Portfolio Investment and (2) the

<PAGE>


       denominator of which is the sum of the aggregate of (X) the Capital
       Commitments of all previously admitted Partners and (Y) (without
       duplication) the Capital Commitments of all Additional Limited Partners,

together with, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), an amount calculated as
interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 200 basis
points from the dates that contribution of such amounts by such Additional
Limited Partner would have been due if such Additional Limited Partner had been
admitted to the Partnership or had increased its Capital Commitment, as the case
may be, on the date of the Initial Closing, to the date that the payment
required to be made by such Additional Limited Partner pursuant to this Section
11.2(a)(iii) is made, which interest shall be treated as provided in Section
11.2(b), and less such amount as is necessary to take into account all
distributions theretofore made.

A Person shall be deemed admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited
Partner at the time that the foregoing conditions are satisfied and when such
Person is listed as a limited partner of the Partnership, and the Capital
Commitment made with respect to such Person is listed, in the Partnership
Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Person admitted to the Partnership as
an Additional Limited Partner after March 31, 2000 shall not be permitted to
participate in Portfolio Investments made prior to January 1st of the year
following the year in which such Person was admitted to the Partnership.

              (b)    CERTAIN PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS. Any amount paid by an
Additional Limited Partner pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iii)(A) with respect to
the acquisition of Portfolio Investment (and any interest paid thereon) shall be
remitted promptly to the previously admitted Partners, PRO RATA in accordance
with their Capital Contributions used to fund the acquisition of such Portfolio
Investment (before giving effect to the adjustments referred to in the
following clause), and the Partners' Sharing Percentages for such Portfolio
Investment shall be appropriately adjusted. Any amount paid by an Additional
Limited Partner pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iii)(B) (and any interest paid
thereon) shall be remitted promptly to the previously admitted Partners, PRO
RATA in accordance with their Capital Commitments. Such payments and remittances
shall, in accordance with section 707(a) of the Code, be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement and for all accounting and tax reporting purposes as
payments made directly from the Additional Limited Partner to the previously
admitted Partners and not as items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction,
contribution or distribution. Such Additional Limited Partner shall succeed to
the Capital Contributions of the previously admitted Partners attributable to
the portion of the amount remitted to such previously admitted Partners pursuant
to Section 11.2(a)(iii) (not including any amount calculated as interest
thereon), as appropriate, and the Capital Contributions of the previously
admitted Partners shall be decreased

<PAGE>


accordingly. In addition, the Remaining Capital Commitments of the previously
admitted Limited Partners shall be increased by such amount remitted (not
including any amount calculated as interest thereon), and the amount of such
increase in Remaining Capital Commitments may be called again by the
Partnership. The Remaining Capital Commitment of the Additional Limited Partner
shall be appropriately determined by the General Partner. The Partnership
Register shall be amended by the General Partner as appropriate to show the name
and business address of each Additional Limited Partner and the amount of its
Capital Commitment. Neither the admission of an Additional Limited Partner nor
an increase in the amount of an Additional Limited Partner's Capital Commitment
shall be a cause for dissolution of the Partnership.

              (c)    NO CONSENT. The transactions contemplated by this Section
11.2 shall not require the consent of any of the Limited Partners.

              (d)    MULTI-FUND AND MULTI-VEHICLE ADJUSTMENTS. The payments to
be made by, and distributions to be made to, certain Partners pursuant to
Section 11.2 (a) and (b), and the adjustments to be made pursuant to Section
11.2(c) of the Institutional Fund Agreement, shall be adjusted by the General
Partner if it determines in its discretion that such adjustment is necessary or
appropriate to take into account (I) that investments held by the Partnership
may, as of any Closing Date, be held by one or more of the Co-Investment Funds,
(II) that a portion of each Limited Partner's Capital Commitment originally made
to the Partnership may, at the time of the subsequent Closings, be a capital
commitment to one or more Special Investment Vehicles, and (III) closings of a
Co-Investment Fund. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
investments held by the Partnership, the other Co-Investment Funds, and/or
Special Investment Vehicles may be transferred among such entities (for a price
equal to cost plus interest thereon at a rate per annum of the Prime Rate plus
200 basis points) to effectuate the purposes of this Section 11.2 and Section
11.2 of the Institutional Fund Agreement. After the payments, distributions and
adjustments described in this Section 11.2(d) and in Section 11.2(c) of the
Institutional Fund Agreement are taken into account, each investment in a
Portfolio Company shall be held by the Partnership and any Co- Investment Fund
in proportion to their respective capital commitments, including, without
limitation, all capital committed to the Partnership or any such Co-Investment
Fund, as the case may be, after the date on which such investment was made but
prior to March 31, 1999.

              12.1   BANKRUPTCY, DISSOLUTION OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. In the
event of the bankruptcy or dissolution and commencement of winding up of the
General Partner or the occurrence of any other event that causes the General
Partner to cease to be a general partner of the Partnership under the
Partnership Law, the Partnership shall be dissolved and its affairs shall be
wound up as provided in Section 13, unless the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to Section 13.1(a). The General Partner shall take no action
voluntarily to declare bankruptcy or accomplish its dissolution prior to the
dissolution of the Partnership. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the bankruptcy of the General Partner will not cause the General
Partner to cease to be a general partner of the Partnership, and upon the
occurrence of such an event, the business of the Partnership shall continue
without dissolution.

              12.2   DEATH, INCOMPETENCY, BANKRUPTCY, DISSOLUTION OR WITHDRAWAL
OF A LIMITED PARTNER. The death, incompetency, insanity, or other legal
incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution, retirement, resignation, or withdrawal of a
Limited Partner or the occurrence of any other event that causes a Limited
Partner to cease to be a Partner of the Partnership shall not in and of itself
dissolve or terminate the Partnership; and the Partnership, notwithstanding such
event, shall continue without dissolution upon the terms and conditions provided
in this Agreement, and each Limited Partner, by executing this Agreement, agrees
to such continuation of the Partnership without dissolution.

              13.1   DURATION. (a) DISSOLUTION EVENTS. There shall be a
dissolution of the Partnership and its affairs shall be wound up upon the first
to occur of any of the following events:

              (i)    the day after the date that is one year after the
       dissolution of the Institutional Fund; or

              (iii)  the withdrawal, bankruptcy or dissolution and commencement
       of winding up of the General Partner, or the assignment by the General
       Partner of its entire interest in the Partnership in contravention of
       this Agreement, or the occurrence of any other event that causes the
       General Partner to cease to be a general partner of the Partnership under
       the Partnership Law, UNLESS, within 90 calendar days after the occurrence
       of such event, a substitute general partner is appointed by the a
       Majority in Interest effective as of the date of withdrawal (I) at the

       general partner of the Partnership that is hereby authorized to and does
       (unanimously in the case of more than one general partner) elect to
       continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution or (II) the
       business of the Partnership is otherwise continued without dissolution
       pursuant to the provisions of the Partnership Law and PROVIDED, that for
       the purposes of this Section 13.1, the General Partner shall not be
       deemed to have been dissolved or to have commenced a winding up as a
       result of the fact that any general partner of the General Partner ceases
       to be a general partner of the General Partner if and as long as the
       General Partner shall have at least one remaining general partner who
       shall have the right and shall elect to carry on the business of the
       General Partner; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the conversion of the
       General Partner to a limited partnership, limited liability company or
       other entity, or the Transfer of the General Partner's interest as the
       general partner of the Partnership to, or the merger of the General
       Partner with and into, a limited partnership, limited liability company
       or other entity as provided for in Section 2.7 shall not, for the
       purposes of this Section 13.1 be deemed a dissolution or winding up or
       commencement of winding up of the General Partner; or

              (b)    CONTINUATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP AFTER DISSOLUTION. As
contemplated by Sections 1.4 and 10.1, the Partnership shall continue after the
expiration of the Term for purposes of Section 10.1(b). After dissolution of the
Partnership, the Partnership shall engage in no activities other than those
contemplated by Sections 10.1 and 13, and those reasonably necessary, convenient
or incidental thereto.

              13.2   DISTRIBUTION UPON DISSOLUTION. Upon the dissolution of the
Partnership, the General Partner (or, if dissolution of the Partnership should
occur by reason of Section 13.1(a)(iii), a liquidating trustee selected by the
General Partner, or if the General Partner has dissolved or withdraws from the
Partnership, or other representative duly designated by a Majority in Interest)
shall proceed, subject to the provisions of this Section 13, to liquidate the
Partnership and apply the proceeds of such liquidation, or in its sole
discretion to distribute Partnership assets, in the following order of priority:

              FIRST, to creditors in satisfaction of debts and liabilities of
       the Partnership, whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision
       for payment (other than any loans or advances that may have been made by
       any of the Partners to the Partnership), and the expenses of liquidation
       whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment, any
       such reasonable reserves (which may be funded by a liquidating trust) to
       be established by the General Partner (or any liquidating trustee
       selected by the General Partner, or if the General Partner has dissolved
       or withdraws from the Partnership, or other representative duly
       designated by a Majority in Interest) in amounts deemed by it to be
       reasonably necessary for the payment of the Partnership's expenses,
       liabilities and other obligations (whether fixed or contingent,
       conditional or unmatured);

              SECOND, to the Partners in satisfaction of any loans or advances
       that may have been made by any of the Partners to the Partnership,
       whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment;

              THIRD, to the Partners in accordance with Section 6.3.

              13.3   DISTRIBUTIONS IN CASH OR IN KIND. Upon the dissolution of
the Partner ship, the General Partner (or liquidating trustee selected by the
General Partner or, if the General Partner has dissolved or withdraws from the
Partnership, a representative duly designated by a Majority in Interest) its
successor or other representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to liquidate all of the Partnership assets in an orderly manner and apply the
proceeds of such liquidation as set forth in Section 13.2, PROVIDED THAT if in
the good faith business judgment of the General Partner (or such liquidating
trustee or other representative), a Partnership asset should not be liquidated,
the General Partner (or such other representative) shall allocate, on the basis
of the Value of any Partnership assets not sold or otherwise disposed of, any
unrealized gain or loss based on such Value to the Partner's Capital Accounts as
though the assets in question had been sold on the date of distribution and,
after giving effect to any such adjustment, distribute said assets in accordance
with Section 13.2, subject to the priorities set forth in Section 13.2,
PROVIDED FURTHER that the General Partner (such other representative) will in
good

faith attempt to liquidate sufficient Partnership assets to satisfy in cash (or
make reasonable provision for) the debts and liabilities referred to in
paragraphs First and Second of Section 13.2. The General Partner may cause
certificates evidencing any Securities to be distributed to be imprinted with
legends as to such restrictions on transfers that it may deem necessary or
appropriate, including, without limitation, legends as to applicable federal or
state or non-U.S. securities laws or other legal or contractual restrictions,
and may require any Partner to which Securities are to be distributed to agree
in writing (A) that such Securities will not be transferred except in compliance
with such restrictions and (B) to such other matters as the General Partner may
deem necessary, appropriate convenient or incidental to the foregoing.

              13.4   TIME FOR LIQUIDATION, ETC. (a) At the end of the term of
the Partnership as provided for in the provisos to Section 1.4, the Partnership
shall be liquidated and any remaining assets shall be distributed in accordance
with Section 13.2. A reasonable time period shall be allowed for the orderly
winding-up and liquidation of the assets of the Partnership and the discharge of
liabilities to creditors so as to enable the General Partner to seek to minimize
potential losses upon such liquidation. Subject to Section 13.1, the provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during the period of
winding-up and until the filing of a notice of dissolution of the Partnership
with the Registrar of Exempted Limited Partnerships of the Cayman Islands, as
provided in 13.4(b).

              (b)    FILING OF NOTICE OF DISSOLUTION. Upon completion of the
foregoing, the General Partner (or any liquidating trustee selected by the
General Partner, or if the General Partner has dissolved or withdraws from the
Partnership, a representative duly designated by a Majority in Interest) shall
execute, acknowledge and cause to be filed a notice of dissolution of the
Partnership with the Registrar of Exempted Limited Partnerships of the Cayman
Islands, PROVIDED that the winding up of the Partnership will not be deemed
complete and such notice of dissolution will not be filed by the General Partner
(or such liquidating trustee or other representative) prior to the third
anniversary of the last day of the Term unless otherwise required by applicable
law.

              13.5   GENERAL PARTNER AND MANAGER NOT PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR
RETURN OF CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. None of the General Partner or the Manager, or
any of its or their respective Affiliates shall be personally liable for the
return of all or any portion of the Capital Accounts or the Capital
Contributions of any Partner, and such return shall be made solely from
available Partnership assets, if any, and each Limited Partner hereby waives any
and all claims it may have against the General Partner or the Manager, or any of
its or their respective Affiliates thereof in this regard.

              13.6   REORGANIZATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP. To the extent permitted
by law, in order to effect a reorganization of the Partnership,

              (a)    the General Partner may cause the conversion of the
       Partnership to a limited partnership, limited liability company or other
       entity formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands or any other
       jurisdiction or

              (b)    the General Partner may cause the exchange of the interests
       of the Partners in the Partnership for interests in, or cause the
       Partnership to be merged with and into, a limited partnership, limited
       liability company or other entity formed under the laws of the Cayman
       Islands or any other jurisdiction,

but only if in any such case the Partners (including, without limitation, their
successors) shall become, and no other Persons (other than Persons necessary for
