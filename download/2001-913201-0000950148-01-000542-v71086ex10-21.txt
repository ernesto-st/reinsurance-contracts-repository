        WHEREAS, Shareholder owns all of the issued and outstanding common stock
(the "Shares") of Moore Entertainment;

        WHEREAS, TBA, Moore Entertainment and Shareholder each desire for TBA to
acquire (the "Acquisition") all of the Shares pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, as a result of which Moore Entertainment will

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the
representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE 1

                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

        1.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Shareholder agrees to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to TBA at
the Closing (as hereinafter defined), and TBA agrees to purchase from
Shareholder at the Closing, the Shares, free and clear of any and all charges,
claims, community property interests, equitable interests, mortgages, liens,
security interests, pledges, charges, rights of assignment, rights of purchase,
rights of first offer or refusal, options, warrants or encumbrances of any
nature (collectively, "Liens").

        1.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price")
for the Shares shall be an amount equal to Two Million Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($2,200,000), subject to possible adjustment as provided in the

        "Adjustable Note") in the original principal amount of One Million One
        Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000) (the "Adjustable Note Portion"),

immunities with respect to any or all of the Shares, Shareholder shall take all
such action.

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TBA

        TBA hereby represents and warrants to Moore Entertainment and
Shareholder as follows:

State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on its business as now conducted.

corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by TBA and the consummation by TBA of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of TBA, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of TBA are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by TBA and constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of TBA, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general
principles of equity. None of the execution and delivery of this




                                      -2-
<PAGE>   7

Agreement by TBA, the performance by TBA of its obligations hereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by TBA will require any
consent, approval or notice under, or violate, breach, be in conflict with or
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default) under, or permit the termination of, or result in
the creation or imposition of any lien upon any properties, assets or business
of TBA under any note, bond, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease,
franchise, permit, authorization, license, contract, instrument or other
agreement or commitment or any order, judgment or decree to which TBA is a party
or by which TBA or any of its assets or properties is bound or encumbered,
except those that have already been given, obtained or filed. No authorization,
consent or approval of, or filing with, any public body, court or governmental
or regulatory authority is necessary on the part of TBA for the consummation by
TBA of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        2.3 Certain Corporate Matters. TBA is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership of its properties, the employment of its personnel or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a materially adverse effect on TBA and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
TBA has full corporate power and authority and all authorizations, licenses and
permits necessary to carry on the business in which it engages or in which it
proposes presently to engage and to own and use the properties owned and used by
it. TBA is not in default under or in violation of any material provision of its
charter or bylaws.

        2.4 Broker's Fees. Neither TBA nor anyone on its behalf has any
liability to any broker, finder, investment banker or similar agent, or has
agreed to pay any brokerage fees, finder's fees or commissions, or to reimburse
any expenses of any broker, finder, investment banker or similar agent in
connection with the Acquisition or any similar transaction.

        2.5 Disclosure. The representations and warranties and statements of
fact made by TBA in this Agreement and in certificates and other written
statements or agreements delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement
are accurate, correct and complete on the date of this Agreement and will be
accurate, correct and complete at the Closing and do not and will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make such representations and warranties and statements
and information contained herein or therein not misleading.

        2.6 No Actions Pending. There are no actions, claims, complaints,
grievances, suits, governmental inquiries, governmental investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of TBA, threatened, and to the
knowledge of TBA, there are no investigations pending or threatened, which in
any manner challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by or before any court, arbitrator
or administrative or governmental body.

        2.7 Investment Intent. TBA is acquiring the Shares for its own account
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection
with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"). TBA will not sell or otherwise dispose of any
Shares in a manner which would require




                                      -3-
<PAGE>   8

registration under the Securities Act or any applicable blue sky law unless such
registrations are effected.

        2.8 Information. TBA has had an opportunity to ask questions of, and
receive answers from, Shareholder concerning the Shares, and the operations,
financial condition and prospects of Moore Entertainment.

        2.9 Sophistication of TBA. TBA has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in the Shares.

        2.10 Accredited Investor. TBA is an "accredited investor" as that term
is defined in regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


                                   ARTICLE 3

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
                       SHAREHOLDER AND MOORE ENTERTAINMENT

        Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered section of the

jurisdictions specified in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule, which are the

owned and used by it. Moore Entertainment has delivered to TBA true, accurate

Moore Entertainment, the stock certificate books and the stock record books of
Moore Entertainment are complete and correct and have been delivered to TBA. The
stock record books of Moore Entertainment and the shareholder lists of Moore
Entertainment which Moore Entertainment has previously furnished to TBA are
complete and correct and accurately reflect the record and beneficial ownership
of all the outstanding shares of Moore Entertainment's capital stock and all

contract, lease, sublease, loan agreement, note or other obligation or liability
by which it is bound or to which any of its assets is subject.

        3.2 Capitalization. Moore Entertainment's entire authorized capital
stock consists of 2,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share ("Moore
Entertainment Common Stock"), of which 1,000 shares are issued and outstanding
and 1,000 shares will be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing
Date. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Moore Entertainment Common
Stock have been and, as of the Closing Date, will be duly authorized and are
and, as of the Closing Date, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and have not been and, as of the Closing Date, will not be issued
in violation of any pre-emptive rights. There are no outstanding or authorized
options, rights, warrants, calls, convertible securities, rights to subscribe,
conversion rights or other agreements or commitments to which Moore
Entertainment is a party or which are binding upon Moore Entertainment providing
for the issuance or transfer by Moore Entertainment of additional shares of its

stock for issuance, nor are there any outstanding stock option rights,
contracts, arrangements or commitments based upon the book value, income or

agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of Moore Entertainment's
capital stock. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, TBA will own the entire
equity interest in Moore Entertainment and Moore Entertainment will not have
outstanding any stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for any shares
of its capital stock, nor have outstanding any rights, options, agreements or
arrangements to subscribe for or to purchase its capital stock or any stock or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for its capital stock. Shareholder
is the only holder of capital stock of Moore Entertainment. To the knowledge of
Shareholder and Moore Entertainment, all capital stock, options, warrants and
other securities issued by Moore Entertainment were issued in compliance, in all
respects, with all applicable federal and state securities laws.

        3.3 Authorization of Transaction. Moore Entertainment has the requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement

Entertainment and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Moore
Entertainment, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general

Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Moore
Entertainment, the performance by Moore Entertainment of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Moore
Entertainment will require any consent, approval or notice under, or violate,

        3.8 Tax Returns and Audits.

            (a) The taxable year of Moore Entertainment ends December 31. Moore
        Entertainment has duly and timely filed or caused to be filed all tax
        returns (the "Tax Returns") required to be filed on behalf of itself and
        has paid in full or fully reserved against in the Financial Statements
        all taxes, interest, penalties, assessments and deficiencies due or
        claimed to be due on behalf of itself to foreign, federal, state or
        local taxing authorities (including taxes on properties, income,
        franchises, licenses, sales, use and payrolls). Except as set forth in
        Section 3.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, such Tax Returns are correct in
        all material respects, and Moore Entertainment is not required to pay
        any other taxes for such periods except as shown in such Tax Returns.
        The income tax returns filed by Moore Entertainment have not been, and
        are not being, to the knowledge of Shareholder, examined by the Internal
        Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authorities for any period.
        All taxes or estimates thereof that are due, or are claimed or asserted
        by any taxing authority to be due, have been timely and appropriately
        paid so as to avoid penalties for underpayment. Except for amounts not
        yet due and payable, all tax liabilities to which the properties of
        Moore Entertainment may be subject have been paid and discharged. The
        provisions for income and other taxes payable reflected in the Financial
        Statements make adequate provision for all then accrued and unpaid taxes
        of Moore Entertainment. There are no tax liens (other than liens for
        taxes which are not yet due and payable) on any of the property of Moore
        Entertainment, nor are there any pending or threatened examinations or
        tax claims asserted. Moore Entertainment has not granted any extensions
        of limitation periods applicable to tax claims or filed a consent under
        Section 341(f) of the Code relating to collapsible corporations. Except
        in jurisdictions in which Moore Entertainment voluntarily files tax
        returns, no claim has ever been made by a taxing authority that Moore
        Entertainment is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
        True and correct copies of all federal, foreign, state and local income
        and other tax returns, notices from foreign, federal, state and local
        taxing authorities, tax examination reports and statements of
        deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by Moore Entertainment since
        January 1, 1998, have been delivered to TBA, and the same are listed in

accounting for tax purposes to be adopted, or a position to be taken on any tax
return, or in any tax proceeding, that is inconsistent with the provisions of
this Agreement. In addition, as custodian of the books and records of Moore
Entertainment as of the Closing Date, TBA, or its authorized representatives,
shall be responsible for closing such books and records as of the Closing Date
for state and federal income tax and financial reporting purposes. TBA and
Shareholder shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with such
closing and TBA shall make available to Shareholder all financial and income tax
data, statements, reports and information relating to such closing of the books
and records as of the Closing Date.

        6.9 Adjustment to Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 1.2(b) hereof, (i) should Shareholder voluntarily terminate his
employment relationship with Moore Entertainment prior to the end of the term of
his Employment Agreement (as defined in Section 7.2(e) hereof), other than for
Good Reason (as such term is defined in such Employment Agreement), or (ii)
should Moore Entertainment terminate Shareholder's employment relationship
pursuant to Paragraph 5(b)(iii) or (iv) of such Employment Agreement,
Shareholder shall be obligated to pay to TBA, within fifteen (15) days of the
date of such termination of employment, a dollar amount in cash equal to the
excess of (a) the aggregate portion of the Purchase Price theretofore paid to
Shareholder by TBA for the Shares over (b) the aggregate




                                      -22-
<PAGE>   27

earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of Moore
Entertainment from the Closing Date to the end of the calendar month in which
such employment is terminated.

        6.10 No Deficit Working Capital. On the Closing Date, the dollar amount
of total current assets of Moore Entertainment, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization, shall be equal to or greater than the dollar amount of total
current liabilities of Moore Entertainment. In addition, on the Closing Date,
such total current liabilities shall include the anticipated cost of preparing
the state and federal income tax returns for Moore Entertainment for calendar
year 2000.

        6.11 Section 338(h)(10) Election. TBA and Shareholder shall jointly
elect to treat the Acquisition as a "qualified stock purchase" within the
meaning of Section 338 of the Code and shall timely prepare and file with the
Internal Revenue Service a Section 338(h)(10) election on Form 8023. TBA
indemnifies the Shareholder for the amount by which the Shareholder's combined
state and federal income and excise tax liability arising as a result of the
sale of the Shares in accordance with the Section 338(h)(10) election exceeds
the combined state and federal income and excise tax liability the Shareholder
would have incurred had TBA and the Shareholder not filed the Section 338(h)(10)
election. Any payment due by TBA to the Shareholder hereunder shall be paid,
without right of offset, within thirty (30) days following the agreement of the
parties hereto as to the amount of indemnification payment payable hereunder.
Should the parties disagree with respect to such calculation, an office of
Arthur Andersen LLP other than the office normally used by TBA shall calculate
promptly the indemnification payment due hereunder, if any, and the parties
shall be bound by such determination. Sections 10.8 and 10.9 of this Agreement
shall not apply to the indemnification obligation of TBA under this Section
6.11.

        6.12 Real Estate Lease. TBA shall indemnify and hold harmless
Shareholder and his successors from any and all claims, damages or liabilities
suffered by Shareholder as a result or arising out of Shareholder's personal
guaranty with respect to that certain lease agreement dated September 18, 2000
by and between Moore Entertainment and Emerik Properties Corp. TBA shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to have such guaranty released by the Lessor.

        6.13 Separate Subsidiary. TBA shall operate Moore Entertainment as a
separate, incorporated subsidiary of TBA for the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the date of the final payment made under the Adjustable Note.

        6.14 SunTrust Note. On or before the Closing Date, Moore Entertainment
shall cause all amounts outstanding under that certain promissory note payable
to SunTrust Bank, N.A. to be paid in full. Such payment shall not cause Moore
Entertainment to be in violation of Section 6.10 hereof.

        6.15 Referral Commissions. TBA shall negotiate in good faith the
referral commissions to be paid Moore Entertainment for Moore Entertainment's
business referrals to the other operating divisions of TBA on all material
projects, consistent with the referral commissions paid other operating
divisions of TBA for referrals made to the other operating divisions of TBA or
as otherwise mutually agreed upon by Moore Entertainment and TBA. In addition,
Moore Entertainment shall be entitled to receive compensation with respect to
services




                                      -23-
<PAGE>   28

rendered by Moore Entertainment to the other operating divisions of TBA. Such
compensation shall be consistent with the compensation paid for similar services
provided by other operating divisions of TBA and shall be mutually agreed upon
by Moore Entertainment and the operating division of TBA to which such services
are rendered.

        representation or warranty or a failure to perform a covenant on the
        part of Moore Entertainment or Shareholder with respect to their
        representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement
        and any such breach or failure constitutes a Material Adverse Breach;
        and

            (d) by Moore Entertainment if there has been a misrepresentation or
        a breach of a representation or warranty or a failure to perform a
        covenant on the part of TBA with respect to their representations,
        warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement and any such breach
        or failure constitutes a Material Adverse Breach.

        8.4 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as provided
in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become void and there shall be no liability
or further obligation on the part of any party hereto or any of their respective
shareholders, officers or directors, except that nothing herein and no
termination pursuant hereto will relieve any party from liability for any breach
of this Agreement and the provisions of Section 6.6 and any confidentiality
agreements by and between TBA and Moore Entertainment will survive such
termination.


                                   ARTICLE 9

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

        9.1 By TBA, Moore Entertainment and Shareholder. Subject to the survival
period set forth in Section 10.1, TBA on the one hand and Moore Entertainment
and Shareholder on the other hand each hereby agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the other against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, settlement costs and any legal,
accounting or other expenses for defending any actions or threatened actions)
(collectively "Damages") reasonably incurred by TBA, Moore Entertainment and
Shareholder in connection with each and all of the matters set forth below to
the extent they constitute a Material Adverse Breach.

            (a) Any breach by the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) of any
        representation or warranty made by such Indemnifying Party in this
        Agreement;

            (b) Any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the
        Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement or any other agreement,
        instrument or document contemplated by this Agreement; and

            (c) Any misrepresentation contained in any statement, certificate or
        schedule furnished by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement
        or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        9.2 Claims for Indemnification. Whenever any claim shall arise for
indemnification hereunder, the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified
Party") shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the claim and, when known, the facts constituting the
basis for such claim. In the event of any such claim for indemnification
hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or legal proceedings by
a third party, the notice to the Indemnifying Party shall specify, if known, the
amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any claim by a third party for
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless suit shall have been instituted against it and the Indemnifying Party
shall not have taken control of such suit after notification thereof as provided
in Section 9.3 of this Agreement in which case the Indemnified Party may settle
or compromise such claim without the prior consent of the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to give prompt notice of any claim and such failure
prejudices the Indemnifying Party's position or its ability to defend the claim,
the Indemnifying Party's liability to the Indemnified Party shall be reduced by
the




                                      -28-
<PAGE>   33

amount, if any, demonstrated to be directly attributable to the failure to give
such notice in a timely manner.

        9.3 Defense by Indemnifying Party. In connection with any claim giving
rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any claim or legal
proceeding by a person who is not a party to this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party at its sole cost and expense may, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party, assume the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding if it
acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligations to indemnify
the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such action, with its counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claim or litigation
resulting therefrom within thirty (30) days after the date such claim is made,
(a) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation, in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such
claim or litigation, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party,
on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and (b) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the
defense of such action, with its counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the
Indemnified Party defended such third party claim or the amount or nature of any
such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party did not defend or
settle such third party claim in a reasonably prudent manner.

        9.4 Payment of Indemnification Obligation. All indemnification by TBA,
Moore Entertainment or Shareholder hereunder shall be effected by payment by
wire transfer or delivery of a cashier's or certified check in the amount of the
indemnification liability.

        9.5 Limitations. EXCEPT IN CASES OF FRAUD, THE PARTIES AGREE AND
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 9 SHALL BE
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF SUCH PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR CLAIMS
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS SIGNED OR EXECUTED IN RELATION TO
THE CLOSING (EXCEPT FOR THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT AND ADJUSTABLE NOTE, THE TERMS
OF WHICH SHALL CONTROL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF SUCH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENTS). EXCEPT
IN CASES OF FRAUD, THE AGGREGATE, MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH OF THE SHAREHOLDER
AND TBA UNDER THIS ARTICLE 9 SHALL BE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PURCHASE PRICE.


                                   ARTICLE 10

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

        10.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
one (1) year. Notwithstanding the above, claims resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty concerning tax or Moore Entertainment Employee
Benefit Plan matters shall expire one hundred




                                      -29-
<PAGE>   34

twenty (120) days after the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.
Any litigation arising out of or attributable to a breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein must be commenced within the applicable
period described above. If not commenced within the applicable period, any such
claim will thereafter conclusively be deemed to be waived regardless of when
such claim is or should have been discovered.

        10.2 Effect of Due Diligence. No investigation by TBA or Moore
Entertainment into the business, operations and condition of the other shall
diminish in any way the effect of any representations or warranties made by
either party in this Agreement or shall relieve such party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

        10.3 Specific Performance. TBA, Moore Entertainment and Shareholder
understand and agree that the covenants and undertakings on each of their parts
herein contained are uniquely related to the desire of TBA, Moore Entertainment
and Shareholder to consummate the Acquisition, that the Acquisition is a unique
business opportunity for Moore Entertainment, TBA, and Shareholder and that,
although monetary damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and
undertakings, monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor.
Accordingly, Moore Entertainment, TBA and Shareholder agree that TBA shall be
entitled to obtain specific performance by Moore Entertainment and Shareholder
of every such covenant and undertaking contained herein to be performed by Moore
Entertainment and Shareholder and that Moore Entertainment and Shareholder shall
be entitled to obtain specific performance from TBA of each and every covenant
and undertaking herein contained to be observed or performed by TBA.

        10.4 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally,
sent by telex, telecopy, facsimile or overnight courier, or mailed by registered
or certified mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested), to the party
to whom the same is so delivered, sent or mailed at the following addresses (or
