Performance Unit Award Agreement</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of February&nbsp;24,
2010, is by and between The Chubb Corporation (the &#147;<U>Corporation</U>&#148;) and
<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> (the &#147;<U>Participant</U>&#148;), pursuant to The Chubb Corporation Long-Term
Incentive Plan (2009) (the &#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall
have the same meanings given to such terms in the Plan. If any provision of this Agreement
conflicts with any provision of the Plan (as either may be interpreted from time to time by the
Committee), the Plan shall control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee has authorized the grant to the
Participant of Performance Units in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
subject to the acceptance of its terms by the Participant; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Participant and the Corporation desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence
and confirm the grant of such Performance Units on the terms and conditions set forth herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW THEREFORE</B>, the Participant and the Corporation agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Grant of Performance Units</U>. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the Corporation on the date set forth above (the
&#147;<U>Grant Date</U>&#148;) has granted and hereby evidences the grant to the Participant, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, of an award of &#95;&#95;&#95;Performance Units (the
&#147;<U>Award</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Payment of Earned Performance Units.</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Settlement of Performance Units</U>. Subject to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2, Section&nbsp;4, and Section&nbsp;5, the Payment Value of
each Performance Unit covered by the Award which the Committee determines, in writing, to be earned
pursuant to Section&nbsp;3 shall be paid by the Corporation on a date (the &#147;vesting date&#148;) as soon as
administratively practicable after (but no later than 2<FONT style="font-size: 70%"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>/<FONT style="font-size: 60%">2</FONT> months after the calendar year end
coincident with) the end of the Performance Cycle described in Section&nbsp;3(a). Payments hereunder
shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee in
its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the vesting date shall be the last day of
the Performance Cycle if (i)&nbsp;the Participant experiences a Qualifying Termination on or after
December&nbsp;31, 2010 or (ii)&nbsp;the Committee determines, in its discretion, pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(b),
that the Participant will not forfeit his or her rights to Performance Units upon his or her
termination of employment for other reasons; in either case, provided the Committee determines, in
writing, that Performance Units are to be awarded hereunder.

filed with the Corporation under its Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan (2005) (or any
successor plan or program) (the &#147;Deferred Compensation Plan&#148;), and on a form acceptable to the
Committee, not later than June&nbsp;30, 2012 and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee
may specify, to have any payment that may become due in respect of Performance Units covered by the
Award deferred until such later time as shall be specified in such election.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Performance Cycle</U>. The Performance Cycle for this Award shall commence on January&nbsp;1, 2010, and shall end on
December&nbsp;31, 2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Performance Goal</U>. The Performance Goal for the Performance Cycle is the total return per share of Stock to
the Corporation&#146;s shareholders, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of whether paid in cash or
property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in Stock), during the Performance Cycle in
comparison to the total return per share of stock, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of
whether paid in cash or property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in stock), achieved by
the companies (i)&nbsp;that are in the Standard &#038; Poors 500 Index (the &#147;<U>S&#038;P 500</U>&#148;) on the date
the Performance Cycle begins and (ii)&nbsp;that continue to file public reports pursuant to the Act for
the entirety of the Performance Cycle (such companies, the &#147;<U>Comparison Companies</U>&#148;). For
the avoidance of doubt, a company included in the S&#038;P 500 on the date the Performance Cycle
commences that is not included in the S&#038;P 500 at the conclusion of the Performance Cycle will be a
Comparison Company as long as it files public reports pursuant to the Act for the entire
Performance Cycle (and any company first included in the S&#038;P 500 after the start of the Performance
Cycle would not be a Comparison Company).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Comparison of Total Shareholder Return</U>. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;5, the Performance Units covered by the Award shall be deemed
earned based on where the Corporation&#146;s total shareholder return during the Performance Cycle ranks
in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period. For
purposes of calculating the total shareholder return of the Corporation and the Comparison
Companies during the Performance Cycle, the value of each such company&#146;s stock at the beginning and
end of the Performance Cycle shall be established based on the average of the averages of the high
and low trading prices of the applicable stock on the principal exchange on which the stock trades
for the 15 trading days occurring immediately prior to the beginning or end of the Performance
Cycle, as the case may be. Such averages for each such company (including the Corporation) shall
be referred to herein as the &#147;Beginning Average Value&#148; and the &#147;Ending Average Value.&#148; As soon as
practicable after the completion of the Performance Cycle, the total shareholder returns of the
Comparison Companies will be calculated and ranked from highest to lowest. The Corporation&#146;s total
shareholder return will then be ranked in terms of which percentile it would have placed in among
the Comparison Companies. In calculating the total shareholder return with respect to either the
Corporation or any of the Comparison Companies, the Committee shall make or shall cause to be made
such appropriate adjustments to the calculation of total shareholder return for such entity
(including, without limitation, adjusting the Beginning Average Value) as shall be necessary or
appropriate to avoid an artificial increase or decrease in such return as a result of a

performance, then the number of Performance Units earned on the vesting date shall be determined by
multiplying the relative percentile of comparative performance achieved by the Corporation by two
(e.g., if the Corporation&#146;s total shareholder return would have placed in the 40th percentile, then
80% of the Performance Units covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date; if the
Corporation&#146;s total shareholder return would have placed in the 75th percentile, then 150% of the
Performance Units covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date).

an employment agreement shall be in an amount equal to the same Payment Value (without pro-ration)

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Participant&#146;s Performance Units shall be immediately
forfeited and canceled without further action by the Corporation or the Participant upon the
Participant&#146;s termination of employment for Cause. For purposes of the Award, the term

after the Participant&#146;s normal retirement age or earliest retirement date, in each case as
specified in the Pension Plan of The Chubb Corporation or its successor (the &#147;<U>Pension

to protect the Corporation in the conduct of its business. If any restriction contained in this
Section&nbsp;10 shall be deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by reason of the extent,
duration, or geographical scope hereof, or otherwise, then the court making such determination
shall have the right to reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope, or other provisions
hereof, and in its reduced form such restriction shall then be enforceable in the manner
contemplated hereby.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;<U>Withholding</U>. The Corporation shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to the Participant in
cash in respect of Performance Units covered by the Award any amount of taxes required by law to be
withheld as may be necessary in the opinion of the Corporation to satisfy tax withholding required
under the laws of any country, state, province, city, or other jurisdiction. In the case of any
payments of Performance Units covered by the Award in the form of Stock, at the Committee&#146;s
discretion, the Participant shall be required to either pay to the Corporation the amount of any
taxes required to be withheld with respect to such Stock or, in lieu thereof, the Corporation shall
have the right to retain (or the Participant may be offered the opportunity to elect to tender) the
number of shares of Stock whose Fair Market Value equals such amount required to be withheld.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;<U>Committee Discretion; Delegation</U>. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may
take any action that is authorized under the terms of the Plan that is not contrary to the express
terms hereof, including permitting the Participant to receive (upon such terms and conditions as
the Committee shall determine) all or a portion of the Performance Units covered by the Award, up
to the maximum amount that would have been payable, despite the termination of the Participant&#146;s
employment prior to the settlement date specified pursuant to Section&nbsp;2(a). Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or in any way restrict the power of the Committee, consistent with the terms
of the Plan, to delegate any of the powers reserved to it hereunder to such person or persons as it
shall designate from time to time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;<U>No Right to Continued Employment</U>. Neither the execution and delivery hereof nor the granting of the Award shall constitute or
be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Corporation
or any of the Subsidiaries to employ or continue the employment of the Participant for any period.

time prior to payment in any manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. Any such action
by the Committee shall be subject to the Participant&#146;s consent if the Committee determines that
such action would have a materially adverse effect on the Participant&#146;s rights under such Award,

standard. As soon as is administratively practicable following the date of any such amendment to

such amendment.
