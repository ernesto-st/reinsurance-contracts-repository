may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof; (iii)
except as hereinafter provided, may, at the option of the Company, be incurred
and maintained as, and/or converted into, ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans,
provided that all Loans made as part of the same Borrowing shall, unless
otherwise specified herein, consist of Loans of the same Type; and (iv) (x)
shall not be made (and shall not be required to be made) by any Lender if the
making of same would cause the Revolving Credit Exposure (after giving effect to
the use of the proceeds thereof on the date of the incurrence thereof to repay
any amounts theretofore outstanding pursuant to this Agreement) to exceed the
Total Commitment as then in effect, (y) shall not be made (and shall not be
required to be made) by any Lender if the making of same would cause the
Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to the Company (after giving effect to
the use of the proceeds thereof on the date of the incurrence thereof to repay
amounts theretofore outstanding pursuant to this Agreement) to exceed the
Company's Borrowing Base at such time and (z) shall not be made (and shall not
be required to be made) by any Lender if the making of same would cause the
aggregate principal amount of all Loans then outstanding (after giving effect to
the use of the proceeds thereof on the date of the incurrence thereof to repay
amounts theretofore outstanding pursuant to this Agreement) to exceed
$25,000,000.

         Section 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part
of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan
required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations
hereunder.

         (b) Subject to Section 2.11, each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely
of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Company may request in accordance
herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any
domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the
Company to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less
than $5,000,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing
shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
not less than $5,000,000; provided that a Borrowing may be in an aggregate
amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Total Commitment.
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten
Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

         (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Commitment Expiration Date.

         Section 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a Borrowing, the
Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a)
in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing and (b) in
the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall
be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or facsimile to
the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in the form of Exhibit E
appropriately completed and signed by the Company. Each such telephonic and
written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance
with Section 2.02:

         (i) the aggregate principal amount of the requested Borrowing;

         (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

         (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
    Borrowing;

         (iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period
    to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the
    definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

         (v) the location and number of the Company's account to which funds are
    to be disbursed.

         If no election as to the Type of Borrowing of Loans is specified, then
such Borrowing of Loans shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is
specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Company
shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

         Section 2.04. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative
Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Company by wire
transfer of immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. New York City
time to the account of the Company designated by it in the applicable Borrowing
Request.

         (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Company a corresponding amount. In such event,
if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available
to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Company
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the
date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation or (ii) in the case of the Company, the interest rate applicable to
ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then
such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

         Section 2.05. Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be
of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section 2.05. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.05, the
Company may elect different options with respect to different portions of the
affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans
comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

         (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
facsimile to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in
a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Company.

         (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

         (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and,
    if different options are being elected with respect to different portions
    thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing
    (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and
    (v) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

         (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
    Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

         (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
    Eurodollar Borrowing;

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

         (iv) the amount of the Company's Borrowing Base at such time; and

         (v) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest
    Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which
    shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest
    Period.

         If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing
but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

         (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

         (e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request
with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at
the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if a Default or an Event of Default is in existence, then, so long as a Default
or an Event of Default is in existence (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

         Section 2.06. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Total Commitment (and the Commitment of each Lender)
shall terminate on the Commitment Expiration Date.

         (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce,
the Total Commitment; provided that (i) each reduction of the Total Commitment
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Total
Commitment if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in
accordance with Section 2.08, the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the
Total Commitment. Each such reduction shall be applied to the Commitments of the
Lenders on a pro rata basis based on the amount of such Lenders' respective
Commitments.

         (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Total Commitment under paragraph (b) of this Section
2.06 at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable. Any termination or
reduction of the Total Commitment (or the Commitments of any Lender) shall be
permanent. Each reduction of the Total Commitment shall be made ratably among
the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

         Section 2.07. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Company
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of all Loans on the
Commitment Expiration Date.

         (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Company to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

         (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Company to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

         (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and the Company. Thereafter, the Loans
evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

         Section 2.08. Prepayment of Loans; Additional Borrowing Base
Requirements. (a) The Company shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty,
except as provided in Section 2.13, subject to prior notice in accordance with
paragraph (b) of this Section.

         (b) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by facsimile) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the Borrowing or Borrowings
which are to be prepaid and the currency in which such Borrowing or Borrowings
are denominated and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to
be prepaid. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that
would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as
provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
ratably to the Loans included in

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to
the extent required by Section 2.10.

         (c) If on any date the Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Total
Commitment as then in effect, the Company shall prepay on such date the
principal amount of outstanding Loans equal to such excess. If, after giving
effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Loans, the aggregate amount of all
Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Total Commitment as then in effect,
the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other Borrowers to, pay or deliver
to the Administrative Agent on such date an amount of cash or Cash Equivalents
equal to the amount of such excess, such cash or Cash Equivalents to be held as
additional security for all obligations of the respective Borrower hereunder in
the Collateral Account applicable to such Borrower.

         (d) If on any date, after giving effect to any prepayment of
outstanding Loans pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Revolving Credit Exposure
attributable to any Borrower exceeds the Borrowing Base of such Borrower at such
time, such Borrower agrees to (i) in the case of the Company, within two
Business Days of the date on which the Company receives notice from the
Administrative Agent that the Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to the
Company exceeds the Company's Borrowing Base, prepay the principal amount of
outstanding Loans and/or pay or deliver to the Collateral Agent an amount of
cash or Eligible Securities (valued for this purpose based on the respective
Advance Rate applicable thereto) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess,
with any such cash or Eligible Securities to be held as additional security for
all obligations of the Company hereunder in the Collateral Account applicable to
the Company and (ii) in the case of any other Borrower, within two Business Days
of the date on which the Company or such Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent that the Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to such
Borrower exceeds such Borrower's Borrowing Base, pay or deliver to the
Collateral Agent an amount of cash or Eligible Securities (valued for this
purpose based on the respective Advance Rate applicable thereto) in an aggregate
amount equal to such excess, with any such cash or Eligible Securities to be
held as additional security for all obligations of such Borrower hereunder in
the Collateral Account applicable to such Borrower.

         Section 2.09. Fees. (a) Each Specified Obligor jointly and severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a
commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate on the
daily amount of the unutilized Commitment of such Lender during the period from
and including the Effective Date to but excluding the Commitment Expiration
Date. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of
March, June, September and December of each year and on the Commitment
Expiration Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day).

         (b) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Company and the Administrative Agent.

         (c) Each Borrower severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
for pro rata distribution to each Lender (based on their respective Applicable
Percentages), a fee in

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

respect of each Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower (the
"Letter of Credit Fee") computed at a rate per annum equal to 0.35% on the daily
Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. Accrued Letter of Credit Fees shall be
due and payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year and upon the first day on or after the termination of the
Total Commitment upon which no Letters of Credit remain outstanding.

         (d) Each Borrower severally agrees to pay to each Fronting Lender, for
its own account, a fronting fee in respect of each Fronted Letter of Credit
issued by such Fronting Lender for the account of such Borrower in an amount and
on dates as shall have separately been agreed to by the Company and such
Fronting Lender.

         (e) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the
Persons entitled thereto as set forth above. Fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

         Section 2.10. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.

         (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus 0.35%.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section 2.10 or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.10.

         (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and on the Commitment Expiration Date;
provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section
shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of
any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid
shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current
Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the
effective date of such conversion.

         (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         Section 2.11. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

         (a) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination
    shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
    means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest
    Period; or

         (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (based
    on the reasonable determination of such Required Lenders) that the Adjusted
    LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect
    the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in
    such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the
Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) in the case of
clauses (a) and (b) above any Interest Election Request that requests the
conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request
requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
Borrowing provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect
only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be
permitted.

         Section 2.12. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

         (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
    similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
    or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
    reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

         (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other
    condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay to such
Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

         (b) If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such
Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect
to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

         (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth (i) the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be,
as specified in

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and (ii) the basis, in reasonable detail,
for the computation of such amount or amounts, which shall be consistently
applied shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above
shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

         Section 2.13. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of a mandatory
prepayment under Section 2.08 or the occurrence of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by
the Company pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, the Company shall
compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any
Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the
excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO
Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date
of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of
interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other
banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         Section 2.14. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of any Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if such
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions
and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c) Each Borrower severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender within 10 days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that such
Borrower failed to deduct or withhold and that were paid by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any
obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability (with
reasonable detail) delivered to any Borrower by a Lender or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e) Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law,
such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law
or reasonably requested by the Company (if any), or will comply with such other
requirements, if any, as is currently applicable, as will permit payments under
this Agreement to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; provided,
however, that the Company shall have furnished to each such Lender in a
reasonably timely manner copies of such documentation and notice of such
requirements together with applicable instructions; provided, further, that no
such Lender shall have any obligation to provide such documentation or comply
with such requirements if it would result in a material economic, legal or
regulatory disadvantage to any such Lender.

         (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which such
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall pay
over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this
Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that such
Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to
its taxes which it deems confidential) to such Borrower or any other Person.

         (g) Any Lender that is not a Lender as of the Effective Date shall not
be entitled to any greater payment under this Section 2.14 than such Lender's
assignor could have been entitled to absent such assignment except to the extent
that the entitlement to a greater payment resulted from a Change in Law.

         Section 2.15. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under
Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim in Dollars. Any amounts received after such time on any date may,
in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received
on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest
thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, except that payments
pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 11.03 shall be made directly to the
Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be
due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

         (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment
of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such
parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal then due to such parties.

         (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans, Unpaid Drawings or any fees payable pursuant to
Section 2.09 resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion
of the aggregate amount of such obligations then due and owed to such Lender,
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
face value) participations in such obligations of the respective Borrower or the
Company, as the case

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

may be, owed to such Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all
such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably; provided that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee
or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each
Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively
do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of
set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower
will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such
event, if the relevant Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of
the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

         (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by
it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or 2.15(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in
its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         Section 2.16. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12 or Section 3.06, or if each
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 or
Section 3.06, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14
or 3.06, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Specified Obligor hereby jointly and
severally agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender
in connection with any such designation or assignment.

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

         (b) If any Lender (x) requests compensation under Section 2.12 or
Section 3.06, or if each Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant
to Section 2.14 or Section 3.06, (y) becomes a Defaulting Lender or (z) becomes
a Non-Continuing Lender, then, in each case, the Company, at its sole expense
and effort, shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default then exists,
to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender"), with one or more Person or
Persons, none of whom shall be a Defaulting Lender at the time of such
replacement (collectively, the "Replacement Lender") reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent at which time the Replaced Lender shall assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 11.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement to the Replacement Lender; provided that (i) at the time of any
replacement pursuant to this Section 2.16, the Replacement Lender and the
Replaced Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Assumptions pursuant
to Section 11.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 11.04(b)
to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender
shall acquire all of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of the Replaced
Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to the Replaced Lender in respect
thereof an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal
amount of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, all outstanding Loans of the
Replaced Lender, (B) an amount equal to all Unpaid Drawings that have been
funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with all then
unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal to all
accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender pursuant to
Section 2.09; (ii) all obligations of each Borrower under the Credit Documents
owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause
(i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is
concurrently being, paid), including without limitation all amounts owing to the
Replaced Lender under Section 2.13 as a result of the assignment of its Loans
under clause (i) above, shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement; (iii) no assignment pursuant to this Section
2.16 shall be effective until all of the then outstanding Several Letters of
Credit are returned by each respective beneficiary to the Issuing Agent for
cancellation in exchange for new or amended Several Letters of Credit which give
effect to such assignment (it being understood that to the extent the respective
beneficiaries do not consent to such assignment, such assignment cannot occur);
(iv) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and each Fronting Lender, which consents shall not be
unreasonably withheld; (v) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments; and (vi) no Lender shall be required to become a
Replaced Lender if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment
and Assumption, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above
and the return, cancellation and exchange of each then outstanding Several
Letter of Credit as provided above and, if so requested by the Replacement
Lender, delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate note or notes
executed by the Company, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder
and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except
with respect to indemnification provisions applicable to the Replaced Lender
under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.

         Section 2.17. Designated Subsidiary Borrowers. The Company may from
time to time designate one or more Persons as an additional Designated
Subsidiary Borrower, subject to the following terms and conditions:

         (a) each such Person shall be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company;

         (b) each such Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall enter into an
appropriately completed DSB Assumption Agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto
on or prior to the date of designation hereof;.

         (c) on or prior to the date of designation, the Administrative Agent
shall have received from such Person a certificate, signed by an Authorized
Officer of such Person in the form of Exhibit F with appropriate insertions or
deletions, together with (x) copies of its certificate of incorporation, by-laws
or other organizational documents and (y) the resolutions of the board of
directors (or similar governing body) of such Person relating to the Credit
Documents which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;

         (d) on or prior to the date of designation, the Administrative Agent
shall have received an opinion, addressed to the Administrative Agent and each
of the Lenders and dated the date of designation, from counsel to such Person
which opinion shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto; and

         (e) no Designated Subsidiary Borrower may incur, or be liable for (by
assignment or otherwise), any Loan hereunder.

         Section 2.18. Extension of Commitment Expiration Date. (a) The Company
may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Lenders) not more than 60 days and not less than 30 days prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date then in effect (the "Existing Commitment Expiration Date"),
request that each Lender agree to an extension of the Commitment Expiration Date
for an additional 364 days from the Existing Commitment Expiration Date. Such
request shall be accompanied by a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the
Company stating that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

         (b) Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall,
by notice to the Administrative Agent given not more than 30 days prior to the
Existing Commitment Expiration Date but in any event no later than the date (the
"Notice Date") 20 days prior to the Existing Commitment Expiration Date, elect
to either extend the Commitment Expiration Date as provided in Section 2.18(a)
or decline to agree to such extension (any Lender declining to agree to any such
extension, a "Non-Continuing Lender"). Any Lender that does not so advise the
Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a
Non-Continuing Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to any such extension
shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.

         (c) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company in writing of
each Lender's determination under this Section 2.18 no later than the date 15
days prior to the Existing Commitment Expiration Date (or, if such date is not a
Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

         (d) The Company shall have the right on or before the Existing
Commitment Expiration Date to replace each Non-Continuing Lender with, and add
as "Lenders" under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Replacement
Lenders in accordance with Section 2.16(b).

         (e) If (and only if) the aggregate Commitments of all Lenders that have
agreed so to extend the Commitment Expiration Date (including the additional
Commitment of any Lender) and the additional Commitments of the Replacement
Lenders shall be equal to 100% of the Total Commitment in effect immediately
prior to the Existing Commitment Expiration Date, then, effective as of the
Existing Commitment Expiration Date, the Commitment Expiration Date shall be
extended to the date falling 364 days after the Existing Commitment Expiration
Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Commitment
Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and
each Replacement Lender shall thereupon become a "Lender" for all purposes of
this Agreement.

         (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each extension of the Commitment
Expiration Date pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall be effective only if the
Company shall have paid in full all amounts owing to each Non-Continuing Lender
hereunder and such Non-Continuing Lender shall have been released of its
obligations in respect of Letters of Credit issued hereunder, in each case, on
or before the Existing Commitment Expiration Date.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                Letters of Credit


         Section 3.01. Several Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein, each Borrower may request the Issuing
Agent at any time and from time to time on or after the Effective Date and prior
to the Commitment Expiration Date to issue, for the account of such Borrower and
in support of, on a standby basis, Letter of Credit Supportable Obligations of
such Borrower to any other Person and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions herein set forth the Issuing Agent agrees to issue at any time and
from time to time on or after the Effective Date and prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date one or more irrevocable standby letters of credit in such form
as may be approved by the Issuing Agent which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld (each such letter of credit, a "Several Letter of Credit" and,
collectively, the "Several Letters of Credit").

         (b) Each Several Letter of Credit will be issued by the Issuing Agent
on behalf of the Lenders and each Lender will participate in each Several Letter
of Credit pro rata in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. The obligations
of each Lender under and in respect of each Several Letter of Credit are
several, and the failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or
under any Letter of Credit shall not affect the obligations of the respective
Borrower toward any other party hereto nor shall any other such party be liable
for the failure by such Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under any
Several Letter of Credit.

         (c) Each Several Letter of Credit shall be executed and delivered by
the Issuing Agent in the name and on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for,
each Lender and the Issuing Agent shall act under each Several Letter of Credit,
and each Several Letter of Credit

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

shall expressly provide that the Issuing Agent shall act, as the agent of each
Lender to (a) receive drafts, other demands for payment and other documents
presented by the beneficiary under such Several Letter of Credit, (b) determine
whether such drafts, demands and documents are in compliance with the terms and
conditions of such Letter of Credit and (c) notify such Lender and such Borrower
that a valid drawing has been made and the date that the related Several Unpaid
Drawing is to be made; provided that the Issuing Agent shall have no obligation
or liability for any Several Unpaid Drawing under such Letter of Credit, and
each Several Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and designates the Issuing Agent as its attorney-in-fact,
acting through any duly authorized officer of JPMorgan Chase Bank, to execute
and deliver in the name and on behalf of such Lender each Several Letter of
Credit to be issued by such Lender hereunder. Promptly upon the request of the
Issuing Agent, each Lender will furnish to the Issuing Agent such powers of
attorney or other evidence as any beneficiary of any Several Letter of Credit
may reasonably request in order to demonstrate that the Issuing Agent has the
power to act as attorney-in-fact for such Lender to execute and deliver such
Several Letter of Credit.

         (d) Each Lender represents and warrants that each Several Letter of
Credit constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Lender
enforceable in accordance with its terms, provided that the enforceability
thereof is subject to general principles of equity and to bankruptcy, insolvency
and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

         Section 3.02. Fronted Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein, each Borrower may request that any
Fronting Lender at any time and from time to time on or after the Effective Date
and prior to the Commitment Expiration Date issue for its own account a letter
of credit for the account of such Borrower and in support of, on a standby
basis, Letter of Credit Supportable Obligations of such Borrower to any other
Person and subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth each
Fronting Lender agrees to issue at any time and from time to time on or after
the Effective Date and prior to the Commitment Expiration Date one or more
irrevocable standby letters of credit in such form as may be approved by such
Fronting Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld (each such
letter of credit, a "Fronted Letter of Credit" and, collectively, the "Fronted
Letters of Credit").

         (b) Immediately upon the issuance by any Fronting Lender of any Fronted
Letter of Credit, such Fronting Lender shall be deemed to have sold and
transferred to each Lender other than such Fronting Lender (each such Lender, in
its capacity under this Section 3.02(b), a "Fronting Participant"), and each
such Fronting Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to
have purchased and received from such Fronting Lender, without recourse or
warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such
Fronting Participant's Applicable Percentage, in such Fronted Letter of Credit,
each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of each Borrower under this
Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining
thereto. Upon any change in the Commitments or Applicable Percentages of the
Lenders pursuant to this Agreement, it is hereby agreed that, with respect to
all outstanding Fronted Letters of Credit and Fronted Unpaid Drawings, there
shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

3.02 to reflect the new Applicable Percentages of the assignor and assignee
Lender or of all Lenders with Commitments, as the case may be.

         (c) In the event that any Fronting Lender makes any payment under any
Fronted Letter of Credit and the respective Borrower shall not have reimbursed
such amount in full to such Fronting Lender pursuant to Section 3.05, such
Fronting Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall
promptly notify each Fronting Participant, of such failure, and each Fronting
Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to such Fronting Lender the
amount of such Fronting Participant's Applicable Percentage of such unreimbursed
payment in Dollars and in immediately available funds. If, prior to 11:00 a.m.
(New York time) on any Business Day, the Administrative Agent so notifies any
Fronting Participant required to fund a payment under a Fronted Letter of
Credit, such Fronting Participant shall make available to such Fronting Lender
in Dollars and in immediately available funds such Fronting Participant's
Applicable Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business Day (or, if
notice is given after 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, on the
next Business Day). If and to the extent such Fronting Participant shall not
have so made its Applicable Percentage of the amount of such payment available
to such Fronting Lender, such Fronting Participant agrees to pay to such
Fronting Lender, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest
thereon, for each day from such date to but excluding the date such amount is
paid to such Fronting Lender at the overnight Federal Funds Rate. The failure of
any Fronting Participant to make available to such Fronting Lender its
Applicable Percentage of any payment under any Fronted Letter of Credit shall
not relieve any other Fronting Participant of its obligation hereunder to make
available to such Fronting Lender its Applicable Percentage of any payment on
the date required, as specified above, but no Fronting Participant shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Fronting Participant to make available
to such Fronting Lender such other Fronting Participant's Applicable Percentage
of any such payment.

         (d) Whenever any Fronting Lender receives any payment by any Borrower
as to which it has also received payments from the Fronting Participants
pursuant to paragraph (d) above, such Fronting Lender shall forward such payment
to the Administrative Agent, which in turn shall distribute to each Fronting
Participant which has paid its Applicable Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in
immediately available funds, an amount equal to such Fronting Participant's
share (based upon the amount funded by such Fronting Participant to the
aggregate amount funded by all Fronting Participants and retained by the
Fronting Lender) of the principal amount of such payment and interest thereon
accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.

         (e) The obligations of the Fronting Participants to make payments to
each Fronting Lender with respect to Fronted Letters of Credit issued by it
shall be irrevocable and not subject to any qualification or exception
whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the
following circumstances:

         (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
    the other Credit Documents or any amendment, supplement or modification to
    any of the foregoing;

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

         (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
    the Fronting Participant or any of its Affiliates may have at any time
    against a beneficiary named in a Fronted Letter of Credit, any transferee of
    any Fronted Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may
    be acting), the Administrative Agent, any Fronting Lender, any Fronting
    Participant, any Lender, or any other Person, whether in connection with
    this Agreement, any Fronted Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated
    herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction
    between any Borrower or any of its Affiliates and the beneficiary named in
    any such Fronted Letter of Credit);

         (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any
    Fronted Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
    insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
    inaccurate in any respect;

         (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or
    observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

         (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or

         (vi) any matter or event set forth in subsection 3.05(b).

         (f) Upon the request of any Fronting Participant, each Fronting Lender
shall furnish to such Fronting Participant copies of any Fronted Letter of
Credit issued by it and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested
by such Fronting Participant.

         Section 3.03. Conditions to the Issuance of all Letters of Credit. (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article III, no LC
Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if at the
time of such issuance:

         (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
    arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such LC Issuer
    from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement of law applicable to
    such LC Issuer or any Lender or any request or directive (whether or not
    having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
    over such LC Issuer or any Lender shall prohibit, or request that such LC
    Issuer or any Lenders refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit
    generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such
    LC Issuer or any Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any
    restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such LC Issuer is
    not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the Effective Date, or any
    unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable, in effect or
    known to such LC Issuer as of the Effective Date;

         (ii) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02 are not
    satisfied at that time; or

         (iii) such LC Issuer shall have received notice from any Borrower or
    the Required Lenders prior to the issuance of such Letter of Credit of the
    type described in clause (v) of Section 3.03(b).

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article
III;

         (i) no Letter of Credit shall be issued at any time when the Revolving
    Credit Exposure exceeds (or would after giving effect to such issuance
    exceed) the Total Commitment at such time;

         (ii) no Letter of Credit shall be issued for the account of any
    Borrower at any time when the Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to such
    Borrower exceeds (or would after giving effect to such issuance exceed) the
    Borrowing Base of such Borrower at such time;

         (iii) no Fronted Letter of Credit shall be issued at any time if after
    giving effect thereto the Letter of Credit Outstandings in respect of all
    Fronted Letters of Credit would exceed $25,000,000;

         (iv) each Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date occurring not
    later than one year after such Letter of Credit's date of issuance, provided
    that each such Letter of Credit may by its terms automatically renew
    annually for one additional year unless the respective LC Issuer notifies
    the beneficiary thereof, in accordance with the terms of such Letter of
    Credit, that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed; and

         (v) no LC Issuer will issue any Letter of Credit after it has received
    written notice from any Borrower or the Required Lenders stating that a
    Default or an Event of Default exists until such time as the Issuing Agent
    shall have received a written notice of (x) rescission of such notice from
    the party or parties originally delivering the same or (y) a waiver of such
    Default or Event of Default by the Required Lenders.

         (c) Subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth herein, each
LC Issuer is hereby authorized by each Borrower and the Lenders to arrange for
the issuance of any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or (b) and the
amendment of any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 3.08 and/or 11.02 by:

         (i) completing the commencement date and the expiry date of such Letter
    of Credit;

         (ii) (in the case of an amendment increasing or reducing the amount
    thereof) amending such Letter of Credit in such manner as such LC Issuer and
    the respective beneficiary may agree;

         (iii) in the case of Several Letters of Credit, completing such Letter
    of Credit with the participation of each Lender as allocated pursuant to the
    terms hereof; and

desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, such Borrower shall
give the Administrative Agent and the

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

respective LC Issuer written notice (including by way of facsimile transmission,
immediately confirmed in writing by submission of the original of such request
by mail to the Issuing Agent) thereof prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at
least (x) three Business Days in respect of Fronted Letters of Credit and (y)
five Business Days in respect of Several Letters of Credit, in each case, prior
to the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day), which written
notice shall be in the form of Exhibit G (each, a "Letter of Credit Request").
Each Letter of Credit Request shall include any other documents as the
respective LC Issuer customarily requires in connection therewith.

         (b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a
representation and warranty by the respective Borrower and the Company that such
Letter of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and it will not violate the
requirements applicable to such Borrower and/or such Letter of Credit of,
Section 3.01 or 3.02, as the case may be, and Section 3.03.

         (c) Upon its issuance of, or amendment to, any Letter of Credit, the
respective LC Issuer shall promptly notify the respective Borrower and each
Lender of such issuance or amendment, which notice shall include a summary
description of the Letter of Credit actually issued and any amendments thereto.

         (d) The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit upon issuance shall be
not less than $25,000.

         Section 3.05. Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) Each
Borrower severally agrees to reimburse (x) each Lender, by making payment to the
Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, for any payment or
disbursement made by such Lender under any Several Letter of Credit issued for
its account (each such amount so paid or disbursed until reimbursed, a "Several
Unpaid Drawing") and (y) the respective Fronting Lender directly for any payment
or disbursement made by such Fronting Lender under any Fronted Letter of Credit
issued for its account (each such amount so paid or disbursed until reimbursed,
a "Fronted Unpaid Drawing"), in each case, no later than one Business Day
following the date of such payment or disbursement, with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Lender, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00
p.m. (New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and
including the date paid or disbursed to but not including the date such Lender
is reimbursed therefor at a rate per annum which shall be the Alternate Base
Rate as in effect from time to time (plus an additional 2% per annum, payable on
demand, if not reimbursed by the third Business Day after the date on which the
respective Borrower receives notice from the respective LC Issuer of such
payment or disbursement).

         (b) Each Borrower's obligation under this Section 3.05 to reimburse
each Lender with respect to Unpaid Drawings of such Borrower (including, in each
case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which such Borrower may have or have had against such Lender, or any LC Issuer,
including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any drawing
under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any
non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such
drawing; provided, however, that no Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse any
Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Lender under a Letter of Credit as
a result of acts or omissions

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Lender
(as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable decision).

         (c) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, no LC
Issuer shall have any obligation relative to the other Lenders other than to
confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit
appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on
their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any LC Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of
Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of such LC Issuer's gross negligence
or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final and non-appealable decision), shall not create for such LC Issuer any
resulting liability to any Borrower or any of its Affiliates or any Lender.

         Section 3.06. Increased Costs. If after the Effective Date, the
adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation, order,
guideline or request or any change therein after the Effective Date, or any
change adopted or effective after the Effective Date in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall either (i)
impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or
similar requirement against letters of credit issued by or participated in by
such Lender, or (ii) impose on such Lender any other conditions directly or
indirectly affecting this Agreement or any Letter of Credit; and the result of
any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of issuing,
maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder or reduce the rate of
return on its capital with respect to Letters of Credit, then, upon written
demand to the applicable Borrower by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), such Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or
reduction. The preceding sentence shall not apply to increased costs with
respect to taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a
Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the
jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such
Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein or with respect to Taxes
to the extent that a Lender received additional amounts (or otherwise was
indemnified) for such Taxes pursuant to Section 2.14 (or would have received
additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.14(e) but for a failure to comply with
Section 2.14(e)). A certificate submitted to the applicable Borrower by such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), setting forth (i) the basis
for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender as aforesaid and (ii) the basis, in reasonable detail,
for the computation of such amount or amounts, which shall be consistently
applied shall be final and conclusive and binding on the applicable Borrower
absent manifest error, although the failure to deliver any such certificate
shall not release or diminish such Borrower's obligations to pay additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 3.06 upon subsequent receipt of such
certificate.

         Section 3.07. Letter of Credit Expiration Extensions. Each Lender
acknowledges that to the extent provided under the terms of any Letter of
Credit, the expiration date of such Letter of Credit will be automatically
extended for an additional year, without written

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

amendment, unless at least 30 days (or such other period required under or by
any Legal Requirement or Applicable Insurance Regulatory Authority) prior to the
expiration date of such Letter of Credit, notice is given by the respective LC
Issuer in accordance with the terms of the respective Letter of Credit (a
"Notice of Non-Extension") that the expiration date of such Letter of Credit
will not be extended beyond its current expiration date. The respective LC
Issuer will give Notices of Non-Extension as to any or all outstanding Letters
of Credit if requested to do so by the Required Lenders pursuant to Article
VIII. The respective LC Issuer will give Notices of Non-Extension as to all
outstanding Letters of Credit if the Commitment Expiration Date has occurred.
The respective LC Issuer will send a copy of each Notice of Non-Extension to the
respective Borrower concurrently with delivery thereof to the respective
beneficiary, unless prohibited by law from doing so.

         Section 3.08. Changes to Stated Amount. At any time when any Letter of
Credit is outstanding, at the request of the respective Borrower, the Issuing
Agent will enter into an amendment increasing or reducing the Stated Amount of
such Letter of Credit, provided that (i) in no event shall the Stated Amount of
such Letter of Credit be increased to an amount which would cause (x) the
Revolving Credit Exposure to exceed the Total Commitment at such time, (y) the
Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to such Borrower to exceed the Borrowing
Base of such Borrower at such time or (z) the Letter of Credit Outstandings in
respect of Fronted Letters of Credit to exceed $25,000,000, (ii) the Stated
Amount of a Letter of Credit may not be increased at any time if the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 5.02 are not satisfied at such time, and (iii)
the Stated Amount of a Letter of Credit may not be increased at any time after
the Commitment Expiration Date.

         Section 3.09. Existing Letters of Credit. It is hereby agreed and
acknowledged that all letters of credit described on Schedule 3.09 (the
"Existing Letters of Credit" and each, an "Existing Letter of Credit") which
were issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank and remain outstanding on the Effective Date
shall (i) to the extent any Existing Letter of Credit shall not have been
amended pursuant to Section 5.01(m) or Section 6.13 to satisfy the requirements
of a Several Letter of Credit hereunder, such Existing Letter of Credit shall be
deemed issued under this Agreement as a Fronted Letter of Credit on the
Effective Date and (ii) to the extent any Existing Letter of Credit shall have
been amended pursuant to Section 5.01(m) or Section 6.13 to satisfy the
requirements of a Several Letter of Credit hereunder, such Existing Letter of
Credit shall be deemed issued under this Agreement as a Several Letter of Credit
on the Effective Date.

connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein is, and
all other factual information (taken as a whole with all other such information
theretofore or contemporaneously furnished) hereafter furnished by any such
Persons in writing to the Administrative Agent will be, true and accurate in all
material respects on the date as of which such information is dated and not
incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make such

<PAGE>

quarterly financial statement to normal year-end audit adjustments and the
absence of full footnote disclosure).

         (b) Since December 31, 2003, nothing has occurred which has had, or

Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Except (i) for the Loans, (ii) as set forth in the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet (including the footnote disclosures thereto) of the
Company for its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2004 and (iii) liabilities

purposes of this Section 4.10, "debt" means any liability on a claim, and
"claim" means any (i) right to payment whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured; or (ii) right to
an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to

or unsecured.

         Section 4.11. Tax Returns and Payments. The Company and its
Subsidiaries (i) have timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the

be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) have timely paid or
caused to have timely paid all material taxes payable by them which have become

investigation, audit or claim now pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, proposed or threatened by any authority regarding
any income taxes or any other taxes relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, which could individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the Effective Date, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement or waiver
or been requested to enter into an agreement or waiver extending any statute of
limitations relating to the payment or collection of taxes of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. No tax Liens have been filed and no claims are pending or,

course of business).

         (b) Except as could not reasonably be expected to result, individually
or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Foreign Pension Plan

been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities, (ii) all contributions required to be made with respect to a
Foreign Pension Plan have been timely made, (iii) neither the Company nor any of

the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign
Pension Plan that is required to be funded, determined as of the end of the
Company's most recently ended fiscal year on the basis of actuarial assumptions,
each of which is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of the assets of

Agreement or the other Credit Documents, (ii) prohibitions or restrictions
existing under or by reason of Legal Requirements, (iii) prohibitions and
restrictions permitted by Section 7.11 and (iv) other prohibitions or

provided to, all governmental bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect of the
conduct of its business and the ownership of its property (including compliance
with all applicable environmental laws), except where the failure to comply or
file or otherwise provide could not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All required
regulatory approvals are in full force and effect on the date hereof, except
where the failure of such approvals to be in full force and effect could not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.17. Insurance Licenses. Schedule 4.17 lists with respect to
each Regulated Insurance Company, as of the Effective Date, all of the
jurisdictions in which such Regulated Insurance Company holds licenses
(including, without limitation, licenses or certificates of authority from

Licenses"), and indicates the type or types of insurance in which each such

issued or have been filed with and not objected to by such authorities within
the period provided for objection, except for those forms with respect to which
a failure to obtain such approval or make such a filing without it being
objected to, could not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.19. Security Documents. The Security Documents create, as
security for the obligations hereunder of the Company and each Designated
Subsidiary Borrower, valid and enforceable security interests in and Liens on
all of the Collateral, superior to and prior to the rights of all third persons
and subject to no other Liens. No filings or recordings are required in order to

behalf of the

Company shall deny or disaffirm the Company's obligations under the Company
Guaranty, or the Company shall default in the due performance or observance of

then, and in any such event, and at any time thereafter, if an Event of Default
shall then be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, upon the written
request of the Required Lenders, by written notice to the Company, take any or
all of the following actions, without prejudice to the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against any Borrower,
except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement (provided that
if an Event of Default specified in Section 8.05 shall occur with respect to the
Company, the result which would occur upon the giving of written notice by the
Administrative Agent as specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) below shall
occur automatically without the giving of any such notice): (i) declare the
Total Commitment terminated, whereupon the Commitment of each Lender shall
forthwith terminate immediately; (ii) declare the principal of and any accrued
interest and fees in respect of all obligations owing hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents to be, whereupon the same shall become, forthwith due and
payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby waived by each Borrower; (iii) terminate any Letter of Credit
which may be terminated in accordance with its terms; (iv) direct each Borrower
to pay to the Collateral Account maintained by the Collateral Agent such
additional amounts of cash, to be held as security for such Borrower's

and/or (v) enforce, as Collateral Agent (or direct the Collateral Agent to
enforce), any or all of the Liens and security interests created pursuant to the
Security Documents and/or exercise any of the rights and remedies provided
therein. In addition, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, each Borrower hereby appoints the Administrative Agent (acting
on the instructions of the Required Lenders) as the attorney-in-fact of such
Borrower, with full power of substitution, and in the name of such Borrower, to
disburse and directly apply the proceeds of its Collateral Accounts to the
satisfaction of any of such Borrower's obligations hereunder or under any other
Credit Document. The power-of-attorney granted hereby is a power coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable. Unless directed to do so by the Required Lenders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, the
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to undertake any of the foregoing
actions, and, if it takes any such action it shall have no liability to any
Borrower to continue the same or for the sufficiency or adequacy thereof. At the
request of the Administrative Agent, each Borrower shall ratify all actions
taken by the Administrative Agent hereunder.

                            The Administrative Agent


         Section 9.01. Appointment. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably

         Section 9.02. Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. The bank
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and
powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same
as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it
were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

         Section 9.03. Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall
not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of

shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in
writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 11.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 11.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Company or the applicable Borrower or a Lender, and
the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness
or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document,
or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

         Section 9.04. Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice,
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper
Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it
orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

         Section 9.05. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

         Section 9.06. Resignation. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of
a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the
Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor administrative agent with the consent of the Company (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), provided that no such consent shall be
required at any time when a Default or Event of Default exists. If no successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank
with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative
Agent.

         Section 9.07. Non-Reliance. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         Section 9.08. Co-Syndication Agents. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Credit Document, the
Co-Syndication Agents are named as such for recognition purposes only, and in
its capacity as such shall have no powers, duties, responsibilities or
liabilities with respect to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limitation of the
foregoing, the Co-Syndication Agents shall not, solely by reason of this
Agreement or any other Credit Documents, have any fiduciary relationship with
any Lender or any other Person.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                Company Guaranty


         Section 10.01. The Company Guaranty. In order to induce the Lenders to
enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of
the direct benefits to be received by the Company from the proceeds of the Loans
and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, the Company hereby agrees with the
Lenders as follows: the Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and prompt
payment when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and
all of the Guaranteed Obligations of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower to the
Guaranteed Creditors. If any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations of any
Designated Subsidiary Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and
payable hereunder, the Company unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness
to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, together with any and all
expenses which may be incurred by the Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of
the Guaranteed Obligations. This Company Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and
not of collection. If a claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Creditor for
repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees repays all
or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any
court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its
property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such
payee with any such claimant, then and in such event the Company agrees that any
such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon the
Company, notwithstanding any revocation of this Company Guaranty or any other
instrument evidencing any liability of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower, and
the Company shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the
amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never
originally been received by any such payee.

         Section 10.02. Bankruptcy. Additionally, the Company unconditionally
and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of the Guaranteed
Obligations of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower hereunder to the Guaranteed
Creditors whether or not due or payable by each Designated Subsidiary Borrower
upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 8.05 with respect
to such Designated Subsidiary Borrower, and unconditionally promises to pay such
indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, in lawful money
of the United States.

         Section 10.03. Nature of Liability. The liability of the Company
hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of
the Guaranteed Obligations of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower whether
executed by the Company, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the
liability of the Company hereunder is not affected or impaired by (a) any
direction as to application of payment by each Designated Subsidiary Borrower or
by any other party (other than a direction by the Guaranteed Creditor receiving
such payment), or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed
Obligations of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in
reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution,
termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by each Designated
Subsidiary Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the Guaranteed Creditors on the
Guaranteed Obligations

                                      -69-
<PAGE>

which any such Guaranteed Creditor repays to each Designated Subsidiary Borrower
pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and the Company waives any right
to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any
such proceeding or (f) any action or inaction of the type described in Section
10.05.

         Section 10.04. Independent Obligation. The obligations of the Company
under this Article X are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor,
any other party or each Designated Subsidiary Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Company whether or not action
is brought against any other guarantor, any other party or each Designated
Subsidiary Borrower and whether or not any other guarantor, any other party or
each Designated Subsidiary Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. The
Company waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute
of limitations affecting its liability under this Article X or the enforcement
thereof. Any payment by a Designated Subsidiary Borrower or other circumstance
which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to a Designated Subsidiary
Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to the Company.

         Section 10.05. Authorization. The obligations of the Company under this
Article X shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by any action taken by any Guaranteed Creditor to:

         (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or
    extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of
    the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate
    of interest thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred
    directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and the guaranty herein made
    shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed
    or altered;

         (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed
    Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or
    otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by
    whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever
    securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of
    those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or
    hereof, and/or any offset thereagainst;

         (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any
    Designated Subsidiary Borrower or others or otherwise act or refrain from
    acting;

         (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any
    Designated Subsidiary Borrower or other obligor;

         (e) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
    security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder)
    incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may
    subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any
    liability (whether due or not) of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower to its
    creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors;

                                      -70-
<PAGE>

         (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any
    liability or liabilities of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower to the
    Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of any
    Designated Subsidiary Borrower remain unpaid;

         (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default
    under, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any of the instruments
    or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or
    supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any of such other
    instruments or agreements; and/or

         (h) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable
    principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of the
    Company from its liabilities under this Company Guaranty.

         Section 10.06. Reliance. It is not necessary for the Guaranteed
Creditors to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Designated Subsidiary
Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to
act on their behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance
upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

         Section 10.07. Subordination. Any indebtedness of any Designated
Subsidiary Borrower now or hereafter owing to the Company is hereby subordinated
to the Guaranteed Obligations of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower owing to
the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time
when an Event of Default exists, no Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall make,
or be permitted to make, any payment to the Company in respect of such
indebtedness owed to the Company, but without affecting or impairing in any
manner the liability of the Company under the other provisions of this Company
Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by the Company of any note or negotiable
instrument evidencing any of the indebtedness of any Designated Subsidiary
Borrower to the Company, the Company shall mark such note or negotiable
instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company hereby agrees with the
Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it
may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Company Guaranty (whether
contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all
Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.

         Section 10.08. Waiver. (a) The Company waives any right (except as
shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any
Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Designated Subsidiary Borrower,
any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any
security held from any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, any other guarantor or
any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's
power whatsoever. The Company waives any defense based on or arising out of any
defense of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, any other guarantor or any other
party, other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, based on or
arising out of the disability of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, any other
guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower other than payment in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their
election, foreclose on any security held by

                                      -71-
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more
judicial or non-judicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is
commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable
law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have
against any Designated Subsidiary Borrower or any other party, or any security,
without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Company hereunder
except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid. The Company
waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors,
even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of
reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Company against any
Designated Subsidiary Borrower or any other party or any security.

         (b) The Company waives all presentments, demands for performance,
protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of non-performance,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Company
Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
additional Guaranteed Obligations. The Company assumes all responsibility for
being and keeping itself informed of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower's
financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the
risk of non-payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and
extent of the risks which the Company assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees
that the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty to advise the Company of
information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.

         (c) The Company warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth
above in this Section 10.08 is made with full knowledge of its significance and
consequences, and such waivers shall be effective to the maximum extent
permitted by law.

         (iv) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or facsimile number)
    set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

         (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be

approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not

the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender or (y) Section 6.01(d)(x).
The Administrative Agent or the Company may, in its discretion, agree to accept
notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications
pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures
may be limited to particular notices or communications.

         (c) Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for
notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
given on the date of receipt.

         Section 11.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section 11.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the issuance of any Letter of
Credit or the making of any Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. In the case of any waiver,
each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be restored to
their former positions and rights hereunder and any Default or Event of Default
so waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing. No such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

         (b) Neither this Agreement, any other Credit Document nor any provision
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each Borrower and the
Required Lenders or by each Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i)
increase the Commitment or the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the amount of any amount due
under any Loan or pursuant to any Letter of Credit or reduce any interest or
fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date for payment of any Loan or
reimbursement of any Unpaid Drawing, or any interest thereon, or any

                                      -73-
<PAGE>

fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of the Commitments,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section
2.15(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby or change any of the provisions of this Section 11.02 or the
definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender, (v) release all or substantially all of the
Collateral (except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) under all the
Security Documents or release the Company from the Company Guaranty, without the
written consent of each Lender or (vi) change any provision of Article III
without the written consent of each LC Issuer affected thereby; and provided,
further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any LC Issuer hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such LC Issuer, as the
case may be.

         Section 11.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Each Specified
Obligor jointly and severally agrees to pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for the Administrative
Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facility provided for
herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, or any Lender,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the
Administrative Agent, or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or
protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the
Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during
any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.

         (b) Each Specified Obligor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify
the Administrative Agent, and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective
obligations hereunder or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual
or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
owned or operated by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee or any Related
Party of such Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the

                                      -74-
<PAGE>

gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any Related Party
of such Indemnitee.

         (c) To the extent that any Borrower fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such
Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such.

         (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall
assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

         (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after
written demand therefor.

         Section 11.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby except that (i) no
Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by such Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below,
any Lender may assign to one or more banks, investment funds or other
institutions that make or hold commercial loans in the ordinary course of their
businesses all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) of:

              (A) the Company, provided that no consent of the Company shall be
         required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an
         Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, any other assignee; and

              (B) the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer.

         (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
    conditions:

                                      -75-
<PAGE>

              (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
         Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount
         of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the
         Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
         assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
         with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
         Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and
         the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such
         consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default has
         occurred and is continuing;

              (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
         proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
         under this Agreement;

              (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
         the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
         processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

              (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to
         the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;

              (E) the assignee shall be an NAIC Approved Bank that is not either
         (x) a foreign branch office of a bank or trust company organized and
         existing in the United States or (y) a parent, subsidiary or affiliate
         of any Borrower or any beneficiary under any Letter of Credit; and

              (F) if any Several Letters of Credit are then outstanding, no such
         assignment shall be effective until all such outstanding Several
         Letters of Credit are either amended or returned and reissued, in each
         case to give effect to such assignment.

         For the purposes of this Section 11.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" has
the following meaning:

         "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
    engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and
    similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that
    is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or
    (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a
    Lender.

         (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph
    (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each
    Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
    and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
    Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement
    (provided that any liability of any Borrower to such assignee under Section
    2.12, 2.13 or 2.14 shall be limited to the amount, if any, that would have
    been payable thereunder by such Borrower in the absence of such assignment,
    except to the extent any such amounts are attributable to a Change in Law),

                                      -76-
<PAGE>

    and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
    assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
    under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
    covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
    Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
    to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 11.03). Any
    assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
    Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.04 shall be treated for
    purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
    such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this
    Section.

         (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
    the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
    Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation
    of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and
    principal amount of the Loans and owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
    terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
    shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the
    Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
    pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
    Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
    available for inspection by the Borrowers, and any Lender, at any reasonable
    time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
    executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
    Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
    hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b)
    of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
    paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
    Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in
    the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
    Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
    paragraph.

         (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
and Unpaid Drawings owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 11.02(b) that
affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by

                                      -77-
<PAGE>

assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.15(c) as though it were a Lender.

         (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.12 or 2.14 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's
prior written consent and the entitlement to greater payment results solely from
a Change in Law. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 unless the Company
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.14(e) as
though it were a Lender.

         (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an,
"SPC") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time
by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option
to provide to the applicable Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such
Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to such Borrower pursuant
to Section 2.01, provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment
to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such
option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting
Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The
making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the
Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (x) no SPC shall be liable
for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be
liable and (y) the Granting Lender for any SPC shall be (and hereby agrees that
it is) liable for any payment under this Agreement for which the SPC would be
liable in the absence of preceding clause (x). In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereto hereby agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one
day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC,
it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against,
such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 11.04 any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior
written consent of, the Company or the Administrative Agent and without paying
any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any
Loans to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (if consented to
by the Company and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit
facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC
or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans and
(ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information

                                      -78-
<PAGE>

relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider
of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

         Section 11.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by any Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any
Letter of Credit is outstanding, the principal of or any accrued interest on any
Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding
and unpaid and so long as the Total Commitment (and the Commitment of each
Lender) has not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.13,
2.14 and 11.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Total Commitment
(and the Commitment of each Lender) or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

         Section 11.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         Section 11.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         Section 11.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and
although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of

                                      -79-
<PAGE>

each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

         Section 11.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process(a) . This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

         (b) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent
or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

         (c) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

         (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in connection with disputes arising out of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

         (e) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers
the Service of Process Agent, with offices on the date hereof at 111 Eighth
Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10011, as its designee, appointee and
agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf, and in respect
of its property, service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and
documents which may be served in any such action or proceeding. If for any
reason such designee, appointee and agent shall cease to be available to act as
such, each Borrower agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in
New York City on the terms and for the purposes of this provision reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent under this agreement.

         Section 11.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT,

                                      -80-
<PAGE>

TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         Section 11.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         Section 11.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that (i) the Persons to
whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) that the Administrative Agent and each
Lender shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 11.12 by any of its
and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors), (b) to the extent requested by
any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to
the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Company. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means
all information now or hereafter received from any Borrower relating to the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or their respective businesses, other
than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by any Borrower. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information or, in the case of any Lender, such Lender has treated
such Information in a manner consistent with banking industry standards for the
treatment of confidential information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each party to this Agreement (and any employee, representative or
other agent of each such party) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S.
federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, no
disclosure of any information relating to such tax treatment or tax

                                      -81-
<PAGE>

structure may be made to the extent non-disclosure is reasonably necessary in
order to comply with applicable securities laws. The provisions of this Section
11.12 shall survive the termination of the Total Commitment (and the Commitment
of each Lender) and repayment of the Loans and other obligations arising
hereunder.

         Section 11.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

         Section 11.14. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Company
and each other Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act
(Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Patriot
Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower
and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in
accordance with the Patriot Act.
