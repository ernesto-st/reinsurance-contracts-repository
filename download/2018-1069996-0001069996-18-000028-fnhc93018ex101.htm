As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or      difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually      agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One      Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall      be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active      or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's      London Underwriters.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an Arbiter within      30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may      choose two Arbiters who shall in turn choose an Umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If      the two Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an Umpire within 30 days following their      appointment, each Arbiter shall nominate three candidates within 10 days thereafter, two of      whom the other shall decline, and the decision shall be made by drawing lots.    B.  Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters within 30 days following the date of      appointment of the Umpire.  The Arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable      engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial      formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the      Arbiters shall be final and binding on both parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the      Umpire and the decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon both parties.       Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters may be entered in any court of competent      jurisdiction.    18\F7V1085   Page 13    </FONT></DIV>

If more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such      Subscribing Reinsurers shall, at the option of the Company, constitute and act as one party      for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of      the Subscribing Reinsurers constituting one party, provided, however, that nothing herein      shall impair the rights of such Subscribing Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint,      defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Subscribing Reinsurers      participating under the terms of this Contract from several to joint.    D.  Each party shall bear the expense of its own Arbiter, and shall jointly and equally bear with      the other the expense of the Umpire and of the arbitration.  In the event that the two      Arbiters are chosen by one party, as above provided, the expense of the Arbiters, the      Umpire and the arbitration shall be equally divided between the two parties.    E.  Any arbitration proceedings shall take place at a location mutually agreed upon by the      parties to this Contract, but notwithstanding the location of the arbitration, all proceedings      pursuant hereto shall be governed by the law of the state in which the Company has its      principal office.      Article 27 - Service of Suit (BRMA 49C)   (Applicable if the Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America, and/or is not  authorized in any State, Territory or District of the United States where authorization is required  by insurance regulatory authorities)    A.  It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount claimed to be due      hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a      court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.  Nothing in this Article constitutes or      should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an      action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a      United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by      the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States.    B.  Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which      makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby designates the party named in its Interests      and Liabilities Agreement, or if no party is named therein, the Superintendent,      Commissioner or Director of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the      statute, or his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon whom      may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on      behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract.      Article 28 - Severability (BRMA 72E)   If any provision of this Contract shall be rendered illegal or unenforceable by the laws,  regulations or public policy of any state, such provision shall be considered void in such state,  but this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Contract or the  enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.      18\F7V1085   Page 14    </FONT></DIV>

This Reinsurance does not cover any loss or liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as Insurer or       Reinsurer, from any Pool of Insurers or Reinsurers formed for the purpose of covering Atomic or Nuclear Energy risks.    2.   Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph (1) of this Clause, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss or       liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, from any insurance against       Physical Damage (including business interruption or consequential loss arising out of such Physical Damage) to:           I.  Nuclear reactor power plants including all auxiliary property on the site, or          II.  Any other nuclear reactor installation, including laboratories handling radioactive materials in connection with reactor             installations, and &quot;critical facilities&quot; as such, or          III.
