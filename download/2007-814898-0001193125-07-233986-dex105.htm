Company elects to accept such interest rate quotes, specifying the Shelf Notes (each such Shelf Note being herein called an &#147;<B>Accepted Note</B>&#148;) as to which such acceptance (herein called an &#147;<B>Acceptance</B>&#148;) relates. The
day the Company notifies an Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes is herein called the &#147;<B>Acceptance Day</B>&#148; for such Accepted Notes. Any interest rate quotes as to which Prudential does not receive an Acceptance within the
Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes. Subject to paragraph 2B(7) and the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company agrees to sell to Prudential
or a Prudential Affiliate, and Prudential agrees to purchase, or to cause the purchase by a Prudential Affiliate of, the Accepted Notes at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes. As soon as practicable following the Acceptance Day, the Company,
Prudential and each Prudential Affiliate which is to purchase any such Accepted Notes will execute a confirmation of such Acceptance substantially in the form of <I>Exhibit C</I> attached hereto (herein called a &#147;<B>Confirmation of

prior to its receipt thereof cancel the closing with respect to such Accepted Notes by so notifying the Company in writing. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

have been fulfilled by the time required on such scheduled Closing Day, the Company shall, prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day notify Prudential (which notification shall be deemed received by each Purchaser)

on such Rescheduled Closing Day and that the Company will pay the Delayed Delivery Fee in accordance with paragraph 2B(9)(ii) or (ii)&nbsp;such closing is to be canceled. In the event that the Company shall fail to give such notice referred to in
the preceding sentence, Prudential (on behalf of each Purchaser) may at its election, at any time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day, notify the Company in writing that such closing is to be canceled.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary appearing in this Agreement, the Company may elect to reschedule a closing with respect to any given Accepted Notes on not more than one occasion, unless Prudential shall have otherwise consented in writing.
