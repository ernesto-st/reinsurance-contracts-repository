               --------------------------------
pay to the Bank:

               (a)  on the date of any Principal Drawing or Interest Drawing (as

<PAGE>

applied by the Bank to the payment of interest owed by the Borrower pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 6.1(b);

               (c)  on demand, all reasonable amounts expended, advanced or
incurred by the Bank to satisfy any obligation of the Borrower under this
Agreement or any other Letter of Credit Document or to enforce the rights of the
Bank under this Agreement or any other Letter of Credit Document or Bond
Document (including without limitation any costs incurred by the Bank in
connection with any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding affecting the Borrower,
or any tenant, sub-tenant, licensee or occupant with respect to any portion of
the Project, or any guarantor of the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement
or any of the Security Documents), which amounts will include all court costs,
reasonable attorneys' fees, fees of auditors and accountants and investigation
expenses reasonably incurred by the Bank in connection with any such matter;

               (d)  on demand, except as otherwise provided herein, interest on
any and all amounts unpaid by the Borrower to the Bank when due under this
Agreement or any other Letter of Credit Document from the date such amounts
become due until paid in full at a fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days but calculated on the actual number of days
outstanding) equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess of the Prime Rate;
provided, however, that amounts drawn under a Remarketing Drawing pursuant to
the first sentence of subsection (b) of this Section 6.1 shall bear interest at
an interest rate per annum equal to one percent (1%) in excess of the Prime Rate
from the date of such Remarketing Drawing until such amounts are due and
payable, and thereafter at a rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum in excess
of the Prime Rate;

               (e)  on demand, any other amounts owing to the Bank by the
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Letter of Credit Documents;

               (f)  on the date of issuance of the Letters of Credit: (i) all
attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Bank counsel and bond
counsel in connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit and any and all of the other Letter of Credit
Documents and security documents in connection therewith, the Bond Documents and
the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments hereto or
thereto or consents or waivers hereunder or thereunder); and (ii) all fees,
charges or taxes for the recording or filing of Security Documents paid by the
Bank;

               (g)  on the date of issuance of the Letter of Credit, the initial
annual fee equal to $65,961.66 (the "Annual Fee"), being 1.00% of the original
stated amount of the Letters of Credit, for the period from the date of issuance
of the Letter of Credit through August 15, 2002; and

               (h)  for each subsequent year that a Letter of Credit remains in
effect, the Borrower will pay to the Bank for the one-year period commencing on
the 16th day of August of such year (a "Fee Period") an Annual Fee equal to
1.00% of the undrawn amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on
such date (which amount will take into

                                       12
<PAGE>

account all reductions or increases in such undrawn amount through such August
16), payable in advance on the August 1 immediately preceding the commencement
of such Fee Period.

If subsequent to the payment of an Annual Fee under this subsection, any amount
is reinstated under a Letter of Credit which increases the undrawn amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit to an amount greater than the
amount on which such fee was calculated (the "Increase Amount"), the Borrower
will pay to the Bank the Annual Fee on the Increase Amount within five days of
demand therefor by the Bank.  In no event shall the Bank have any obligation to
make reimbursement or to otherwise account to the Borrower in respect of fees
paid by the Borrower as a result of any reduction in the undrawn amount under a
Letter of Credit and/or any later adjustment to a fixed rate of interest on the
Bonds secured thereby at less than the maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.
If at any point in time the Borrower fixes the interest rate on a series of
Bonds at a rate less than the maximum rate of 12% per annum, the letter of
credit fee due and payable annually thereafter shall be due and payable on the
undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit representing the actual rate of interest
on the Bonds for the next respective Fee Period, if fixed for such Fee Period,
but if the rate of interest on the Bonds can vary during such Fee Period, the
annual letter of credit fee shall be calculated on the assumed maximum interest
rate of 12% per annum.  Provided, however, that upon termination of all
obligations of the Bank under a Letter of Credit, receipt by the Bank of such
original Letter of Credit for cancellation, receipt of all payments pursuant to
this Agreement with respect thereto, purchase of all Pledged Bonds held by the
Bank pursuant to Section 6.6 hereof with respect thereto and if there exists no
default on the part of the Borrower hereunder, the Bank agrees to refund to the
Borrower a portion of the Annual Fee paid in advance with respect to such Letter
of Credit by the Borrower, the amount of such refund to be determined by
multiplying the amount of such Annual Fee paid in advance by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the period for which such
fee has been paid following termination of such Letter of Credit and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such period.

          6.2  Payments.  All payments by the Borrower to the Bank hereunder
               --------
shall be made in lawful currency of the United States of America and in
immediately available funds before 2:00 p.m., Columbus, Ohio time on the date
when such payment is due at the office of the Bank at 7 Easton Oval - EA4E63,
Columbus, Ohio  43219, Attention: International Division, Letter of Credit
Department, or at such other location as the Bank shall designate to the
Borrower from time to time in writing.  Any payment received and accepted by the
Bank after such time shall be considered for all purposes (including the
calculation of interest, to the extent permitted by law) as having been made on
the Bank's next following business day (as defined in the Letter of Credit).

               If the date for any payment hereunder falls on a day that is not
a business day, then for all purposes of this Agreement the same shall be deemed
to have fallen on the next following business day, and such extension of time
shall in such case be included in the computation of payments of interest.

          6.3  Increased Costs Due to Change in Law.  If any change in any law
               ------------------------------------
or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative
agency shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against or

                                       13
<PAGE>

in connection with letters of credit issued by the Bank or against commitments
by any Participant in connection with participation in letters of credit similar
to the commitment made by such Participant under its participation agreement
with the Bank, if any, or (ii) impose on the Bank or any Participant any other
condition regarding this Agreement or a Letter of Credit (other than changes in
the rates of income taxation generally applicable to the Bank or any
Participant), and the result of any such event shall be to increase the cost to
the Bank of issuing or maintaining such Letter of Credit or to increase the
costs to any Participant of maintaining its commitments under its participation
agreement (which increase in cost shall be determined by the Bank's or such
Participant's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases
resulting from such events), then (a) the Bank or the Participant (as the case
may be) shall so notify the Borrower, and (b) upon receipt of such notice from
the Bank or the Participant (as the case may be), the Borrower shall promptly
pay to the Bank or to the Participant (as the case may be) from time to time as
specified by the Bank or the Participant (as the case may be) additional amounts
which shall be sufficient to compensate the Bank or the Participant (as the case
may be) for such increased costs, together with interest on each such amount for
the period from the date of such notice until payment in full thereof at the
Prime Rate plus two percent (2%) (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
but calculated on the actual number of days outstanding). A certificate setting
forth in reasonable detail such increased cost incurred by the Bank or the
Participant as a result of any such event, submitted by the Bank or the
Participant to the Borrower, shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest
                                      ----- -----
error, as to the amount thereof.

          6.4  Obligations Absolute.  The obligations of the Borrower under
               --------------------

paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,

any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, such Letter of
Credit, any of the other Letter of Credit Documents, the Bonds or any other
agreement or instrument related thereto, or in connection with the Project or
any unrelated transaction;

pursuant to, and otherwise in accordance with, the following terms and
conditions:

               (a)  On August 16, 2006, and on each successive August 16
thereafter, if the Extension Notice (as hereinafter described) with respect to a

discretion, by notice in writing given by the Bank to the Borrower and the

               --------------------------------------------------------------

               (a)  As security for the payment and performance of all
obligations of the Borrower to the Bank hereunder and under the other Letter of
Credit Documents, the Borrower hereby agrees that upon the making of a
Remarketing Drawing (as defined in the Letters of Credit, respectively) the
Borrower will forthwith deliver or cause to be delivered (or recorded through
the Depository) to the Bank Bonds or Beneficial Ownership Interests secured by
such Letter of Credit free and clear of all other liens and encumbrances in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of such Remarketing Drawing, less
(i) any portion of such Remarketing Drawing representing interest on the Bonds
or Beneficial Ownership Interests so purchased, and (ii) the amounts the Bank is
reimbursed by 2:00 p.m. Columbus, Ohio time on the Bond Purchase Date
corresponding to the date of such Remarketing Drawing (collectively, the
"Pledged Bonds"), and the Borrower hereby grants to the Bank a security interest
in the Pledged Bonds and in the proceeds thereof.

               (b)  The Borrower hereby agrees to deliver or cause to be
delivered immediately (or recorded through the Depository) to the Bank the
Pledged Bonds which shall be registered by the Trustee (or recorded through the
Depository) in the names of the Borrower as pledgor and the Bank as pledgee,
with the Borrower's endorsements of the Pledged Bonds so delivered to the order
of the Bank. The Borrower further agrees to record through the Depository (if
the Pledged Bonds are held by a Depository in a book entry system) or cause the
Trustee to enter into its registration books (if the Bonds are not held by a
Depository in a book entry system), as the address to which payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Pledged Bonds are to be
sent, the Bank's address for notices pursuant to Section 12.13 hereof as in
effect from time to time.

               (c)  If the Borrower shall become entitled to receive or shall
receive any Pledged Bonds, any payment of interest with respect to the Pledged
Bonds, or any and all other proceeds thereof, the Borrower shall accept any such
items as the Bank's agent, shall hold them in trust for the Bank, and shall
deliver them forthwith to the Bank in the exact form received, with the
Borrower's endorsement to the order of the Bank when necessary, to be held by
the Bank, subject to the terms hereof, as security for the payment and
performance of all obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the other
Letter of Credit Documents, except that the Bank shall credit all payments and
proceeds received by the Bank directly against the Borrower's obligations under
Section 6.1 of this Agreement as provided below.

               (d)  All principal, premium, if any, and interest paid on the
Pledged Bonds shall be retained by the Bank (or if received by the Borrower
shall be forthwith delivered by it to the Bank in the original form received)
and applied by the Bank to the payment of amounts due the Bank from the Borrower
hereunder and under the other Letter of Credit Documents.

               (e)  If the Borrower makes or causes to be made to the Bank a
payment of a Remarketing Drawing pursuant to Section 6.1(b) hereof, or a
Remarketing Agent resells Pledged Bonds on behalf of the Borrower, the Bank
agrees to release from the lien of this Agreement and deliver (or record through
the Depository) to the Borrower or the Remarketing

                                       16
<PAGE>

Agent, as the case may be, Pledged Bonds, endorsed in blank without recourse (if
not held by a Depository in a book entry system) in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the amount of such payment with respect to principal so made, or
the principal amount of the Pledged Bonds so resold to the extent that the
proceeds of such resale are delivered to the Bank.

               (f)  In addition to the rights and remedies granted to the Bank
in this Agreement, the Bank shall have all of the rights and remedies of a
secured party under Chapter 1309 of the Ohio Revised Code and such other rights
and remedies as are granted to a secured party in similar situations to the
extent of the security interest granted under paragraph (a) above.

               (g)  The Borrower shall be liable for the deficiency if the
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Bonds by the Bank are
insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Bank is entitled, including
principal and interest as provided herein, and the reasonable fees of any
outside attorneys employed by the Bank to collect such deficiency.

          6.7  Reinstatement.
               -------------

               (a)  In connection with any Remarketing Drawing, upon receipt by
the Trustee of Pledged Bonds or Beneficial Ownership Interests for the Bank's
benefit in the aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid amount of the
principal portion of such Remarketing Drawing delivered (or recorded through the
Depository) by the Borrower or on its behalf, registered or recorded in the name
of the Borrower as pledgor and the Bank as pledgee in accordance with Section
6.6 hereof, the Trustee's right to draw on the related Letter of Credit shall
automatically be reinstated in an amount equal to the principal portion plus the
interest portion of such Remarketing Drawing, or the aggregate principal amount
of such Bonds plus the interest portion of such Remarketing Drawing, as the case
may be.

               (b)  In the event of an Interest Drawing, the Stated Amount of
the related Letter of Credit shall automatically be reinstated in the amount of
the related Interest Drawing at the close of business on the tenth day following
the date of such drawing unless the Bank shall have delivered to the Trustee a
notice in the form of Exhibit 5 to such Letter of Credit in the event the Bank
has not been reimbursed for such drawing or an Event of Default has occurred

such sale or the scrap value thereof, or (ii) if the removed property is used as

removal, substitution, sale or other disposition having an annual aggregate
value in excess of $25,000 and shall pay to the Trustee or to the Bank, if
applicable, such amounts as are required by the provisions of the preceding
subsection (b) of this Section promptly after the sale, trade-in or other
disposition requiring such payment; provided, however, that no such payment need
be made until the amount to be paid to the Trustee or to the Bank, if the Bonds
have been paid in full (or are deemed to have been paid and discharged under
Article IX of the Trust Indenture) but amounts remain due under this Agreement,
on account of all such sales, trade-ins or other dispositions not previously
paid aggregates in any calendar year at least $25,000.

     At the request of the Bank, the Borrower shall deliver to the Bank such
instruments, including financing statements and amendments thereto, as are
necessary or advisable to perfect the Bank's lien upon and security interest in
any personal property installed in substitution for any property removed
pursuant to this Section.  Upon the request of the Borrower and compliance by
the Borrower with the terms of this Section, the Bank shall execute and deliver
to the Borrower appropriate instruments releasing any property removed pursuant
to this Section from the liens and security interests created by the Security
Documents.

                                       32

substantial part of the assets of the Borrower, or other like relief in respect
thereof under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, and, if such proceeding is being

               ---------------------
Default, the Bank may, at its option, do any or all of the following:

                                       33
<PAGE>

               (a)  Declare the principal of all amounts owing under this
Agreement and the other Letter of Credit Documents (including all obligations
secured by the Security Documents) and all other indebtedness of the Borrower to
the Bank, together with interest thereon, to be forthwith due and payable,
regardless of any other specified maturity or due date, without notice of
default, presentment or demand for payment, protest or notice of nonpayment or
dishonor, or other notices or demands of any kind or character, and without the
necessity of prior recourse to any security;

               (b)  Implement any remedies available to the Bank under or in
connection with the Bond Documents, including without limitation instructing the
Trustee, in the Bank's sole discretion, to accelerate the maturity of the Bonds
and causing and paying a full or partial drawing under each of the Letters of
Credit (whether or not any amounts have previously been paid under such Letter
of Credit) and exercising all of the rights and remedies available to the Bank
in connection therewith;

               (c)  If the Event of Default may be cured by the Bank by taking
actions or making payments of money, the Bank shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to take such actions (including without limitation the retention of
attorneys and the commencement or prosecution of actions on its own behalf or on
behalf of the Borrower), make such payments and pay for the costs of such
actions (including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs) from its
own funds; provided, that the taking of such actions at the Bank's expense or
the making of such payments by the Bank out of the Bank's own funds shall not be
deemed to cure such Event of Default, and the same shall not be so cured unless
and until the Borrower shall have reimbursed the Bank for such payment, together
with interest at the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%), from the date of such
payment until the date of reimbursement. If the Bank advances its own funds for
such purposes, such funds shall be secured by the Security Documents,
notwithstanding that such advances may cause the total amount advanced hereunder
to exceed the amount committed to be advanced pursuant to this Agreement, and
the Borrower shall immediately upon demand reimburse the Bank therefore with
interest at the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%), from the date of such advance
until the date of reimbursement; and

               (d)  Exercise any and all of its rights under the Letter of
Credit Documents or the Bond Documents, or otherwise as a secured creditor,
including, without limitation, foreclosing on any security, and exercising any
other rights with respect to security whether under the Security Documents or
any other agreement or as provided by law, all in such order and in such manner
as the Bank in its sole discretion may determine.

         11.3  Cumulative Remedies; No Waiver.  All remedies of the Bank
               ------------------------------
provided for herein are cumulative and shall be in addition to any and all other
rights and remedies provided in the Letters of Credit, the Security Documents,
the Bond Documents or any of the Letter of Credit Documents, or provided by law
from time to time.  The exercise of any right or remedy by the Bank hereunder
shall not in any way constitute a cure or waiver of default hereunder or under
the Letters of Credit, the Security Documents, the Bond Documents, or any of the
Letter of Credit Documents, nor invalidate any notice of default or any act done
pursuant to any such notice, nor prejudice the Bank in the exercise of any
rights hereunder or under the Letter of Credit, the Security Documents, the Bond
Documents or the Letter of Credit Documents, unless

                                       34
<PAGE>

in the exercise of said right, the Bank realizes all amounts owed to it under
the Letters of Credit, this Agreement, the Security Documents, the Bond
Documents and the Letters of Credit Documents and all Events of Default are
cured. No waiver by the Bank of any default or breach by the Borrower hereunder
shall be implied from any omission by the Bank to take action on account of such
default if such default persists or is other than the default expressly made the
subject of the waiver. Any such express waiver shall be operative only for the
time and to the extent therein stated. Any waiver of any covenant, term or
condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by the
Bank to or of any act by the Borrower shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary consent or approval to or of any subsequent act.

     12.  Miscellaneous.
          -------------

          12.1  Actions. The Bank shall have the right to commence, appear in
                -------
and defend any action or proceeding affecting the rights or duties of the
Borrower hereunder or the payment of any funds, and in connection therewith the
Bank may pay necessary expenses, employ counsel and pay reasonable attorneys'
fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank, on demand, all costs and expenses
incurred by the Bank in connection therewith, including without limitation
reasonable attorneys' fees, together with interest from the date of expenditure
at the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%) (computed on the basis of a year of 360
days but calculated on the actual number of days outstanding).  The Borrower's
obligation to repay such expenses shall be secured by the Security Documents.

          12.2  Nonliability of the Bank. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees
                ------------------------
that:

                (a)  The Bank shall not be responsible or liable to the Borrower
for the use which may be made of the Letters of Credit or for any acts or
omissions of the Trustee or any beneficiary or transferee in connection
therewith;

                (b)  The Bank shall not be responsible or liable to the Borrower
for the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents (except as to the
Bank's signatures thereon), or of any endorsements thereon, even if such
documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent, or forged (except to the extent acceptance
or reliance upon such documents is a result of the Bank's gross negligence or
willful misconduct); and

                (c)  The Bank shall not be responsible or liable to the Borrower
as a result of any circumstances in any way related to the making or failure to
make payment under the Letters of Credit, other than as a result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Bank.

          12.3  No Representations by the Bank. By accepting or approving
                ------------------------------
anything required to be observed, performed or fulfilled, or to be given to the
Bank pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Letter of Credit Documents
or Bond Documents, including any certificate, financial statement, survey,
appraisal or insurance policy, the Bank shall not be deemed to have warranted or
represented the sufficiency, legality, effectiveness or legal effect of

                                       35
<PAGE>

the same, or of any term, provision or condition thereof, and such acceptance or
approval thereof shall not be or constitute any warranty or representation to
anyone with respect thereto by the Bank. The Bank may accept documents in
connection with a drawing under a Letter of Credit which appear on their face to
be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary and may accept documents in connection
with any of the other Letter of Credit Documents or Bond Documents which appear
on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation.

          12.4  No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made for the
                --------------------------
purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of
the Borrower and Bank in connection with the Letters of Credit.  It is made for
the sole protection of the Borrower and the Bank, and the Bank's successors and
assigns.  No other Person shall have any rights of any nature hereunder or by
reason hereof, except to the extent that the Trustee is expressly granted rights
hereunder, or Participants are granted rights hereunder pursuant to
participation agreements with the Bank.

          12.5  Indemnity by the Borrower.  The Borrower hereby indemnifies and
                -------------------------
holds harmless the Bank and the Participants and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees (collectively the "indemnitees") from and
against:

                (a)  any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action
that are asserted against any indemnitee by any Person if the claim, demand,
action or cause of action directly or indirectly relates to a claim, demand,
action or cause of action that the Person has or asserts against the Issuer or
the Borrower, whether in connection with the Letters of Credit, the Bonds, any
of the Bond Documents, any of the Letter of Credit Documents or this Agreement,
or otherwise;

                (b)  any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action
that are asserted against any indemnitee by any Person and arising from or in
connection with (i) any statement or omission, actual or alleged, in the Bond
Documents, or (ii) any breach or default, actual or alleged, of the
representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or agreements contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Letter of Credit Documents or in any of the
Bond Documents; and

                (c)  any and all liabilities, losses, costs or expenses
(including court costs and attorneys' fees) that any indemnitee suffers or
incurs as a result of the assertion of any claim, demand, action or cause of
action specified in Section 12.5(a) or Section 12.5(b) of this Agreement.

          Any obligation or liability of the Borrower to any indemnitee as
provided in this Section 12.5 shall be secured by the Security Documents. The
indemnity contained in this Section 12.5 shall not extend to any claims,
demands, actions, causes of action, liabilities, losses, costs or expenses which
result solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Bank or to
the information set forth in Appendix A to the Official Statement.

                                       36
<PAGE>

          12.6   Commissions. The Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds the Bank
                 -----------
harmless from any responsibility, cost and/or liability, including any
attorneys' fees incurred, in connection with any claim by any Person for the
payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee in connection with the Bonds
or any of the other transactions contemplated in connection with this Agreement
arising from any action taken, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of the
Borrower.

          12.7   Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
                 --------------
to the benefit of the Borrower and its successors and assigns and the Bank and
its successors and assigns, subject to the provisions of Sections 8.18 of this
Agreement. The Bank is authorized in its sole discretion to participate
interests in the Letter of Credit and security therefor to Participants.

          12.8   Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and any other Letter
                 -------------------------
of Credit Document may be executed in any number of counterparts and any party
hereto or thereto may execute any counterpart, each of which when executed and
delivered will be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts of this
Agreement or any other Letter of Credit Document, as the case may be, taken
together will be deemed to be but one and the same instrument. The execution of
this Agreement or any other Letter of Credit Document by any party hereto or
thereto will not become effective until counterparts hereof or thereof, as the
case may be, have been executed by all the parties hereto or thereto.

          12.9   Prior Agreements; Amendments; Consents. This Agreement contains
                 --------------------------------------
the entire agreement between the Bank and Borrower with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements with
respect thereto are superseded by this Agreement. No amendment, modification,
supplement, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of
the Letter of Credit Documents, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom, may in any event be effective unless in writing signed by the Bank,
and then only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose given.

          12.10  Cumulative Remedies; No Waiver. The rights, powers and
                 ------------------------------
remedies of the Bank under the Letter of Credit Documents are cumulative and not
exclusive of any right, power or remedy provided by law or equity or otherwise.
No failure or delay on the part of the Bank in exercising any right, power or
remedy may be, or may be deemed to be, a waiver thereof; nor may any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or remedy preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

          12.11  Inclusion of Expenditures in Indebtedness. All sums paid or
                 -----------------------------------------
expended by the Bank under the terms of this Agreement shall bear interest at
the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%) (calculated on the basis of a year of 360
days but calculated on the actual number of days outstanding), except as
otherwise provided herein, from the date such sums are paid or expended, shall
be secured by the Security Documents and shall be immediately due and payable by
the Borrower upon demand.
