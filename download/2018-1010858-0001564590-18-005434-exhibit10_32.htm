or under any present or future laws to levy or distraint for rent or any other charges which may be due to Landlord against the Collateral, and any and all other claims, liens and demands of every kind which it now has or may hereafter have against

or against the obligations of Landlord under the Lease, (d)&nbsp;no notice of default has been given under or in connection with the Lease which has not been cured, and Landlord has no knowledge of the occurrence of any other default under or in
connection with the Lease, and (e)&nbsp;except as disclosed to each Agent, no portion of&nbsp;the Premises is encumbered in any way by any deed of trust or mortgage lien or ground or superior lease. </P>

license to enter upon and into the Premises to do any or all of the following with respect to the Collateral: assemble, have appraised, display, remove, maintain, prepare for sale or lease, repair, transfer, or sell (at public or private sale). In
entering upon or into the Premises, each Agent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Landlord caused solely by such Agent&#146;s
entering upon or into the Premises and taking any of the foregoing actions with respect to the Collateral. Such costs shall include any damage to the Premises made by such Agent in severing and/or removing the Collateral therefrom. </P>

will deliver notice (the &#147;<U>Landlord&#146;s Notice</U>&#148;) to each Agent to that effect. Within the 45 day period after such Agent receives the Landlord&#146;s Notice, such Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the
Collateral to be removed from the Premises. During such 45 day period, Landlord will not remove the Collateral from the Premises nor interfere with such Agent&#146;s actions in removing the Collateral from the Premises or such Agent&#146;s actions
in otherwise enforcing its security interest in the Collateral. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, neither Agent shall at any time have any obligation to remove the Collateral from the Premises. </P>
