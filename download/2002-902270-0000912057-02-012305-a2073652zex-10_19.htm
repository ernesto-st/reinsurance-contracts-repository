contrary, the limitation described in this Section&nbsp;8.5(c) shall not apply with respect to (A)&nbsp;any fraudulent breach of any representation or warranty or any claim with respect to

immediately prior to Closing, the Purchaser's Loss for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification is one million dollars, and the Seller had actually received, or
thereafter receives, aggregate Purchase Price payment of at least one million dollars, then the maximum amount the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may recover from such Shareholder would be one hundred

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This

this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Purchaser may assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this
Agreement, in whole or in any part, and from time to time, to a wholly owned, direct or indirect, subsidiary of Parent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Agreement and the legal relations among the parties hereto will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware (without
regard to the laws of conflict that might otherwise apply) as to all matters, including without limitation matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
parties agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the formation, breach, termination or validity thereof, except for injunctive relief
contemplated by Section&nbsp;9.12 (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Dispute</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") will be resolved as follows. If the Dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, the parties
will first try to settle the Dispute in an amicable manner by mediation under the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association, before resorting to arbitration. Any Dispute that
has not been resolved within 60&nbsp;days of the initiation of the mediation procedure (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Mediation Deadline</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") will be settled by binding
arbitration in Minneapolis, Minnesota by a panel of three (3)&nbsp;arbitrators, selected in accordance with subsection (b)&nbsp;below, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>American Arbitration Rules</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). The arbitrators in any such arbitration will have the discretion to order a
pre-hearing exchange of information by the parties, including, without limitation, production of requested documents, exchange of summaries of testimony and proposed witnesses, and
examination by deposition of parties. The arbitrators are not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages, as limited by this Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any
damages in excess of compensatory damages. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Minnesota and the federal district court for the State of Minnesota for this purpose. The parties agree that service of process and of any notices required in connection with any arbitration
hereunder or any related court proceedings may be given in the manner provided for the giving of notices under this Agreement as set forth in Section&nbsp;9.5. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
twenty (20)&nbsp;days of the Mediation Deadline, the Purchaser will nominate one arbitrator and the Seller and the Shareholders, together, will nominate one
arbitrator. Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the nomination and appointment of the two arbitrators, the two arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, and if they fail to do so, a neutral arbitrator
will be chosen in accordance with the American Arbitration Rules. </FONT></P>
