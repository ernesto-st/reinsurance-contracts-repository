extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and

                                       40

<PAGE>   61

warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $350,000,000 and (ii) the total
Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

     (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the
close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the
issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension
thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), provided that a Letter of
Credit may include customary "evergreen" provisions and (ii) the date that is
five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

     (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment
to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further
action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the applicable
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender
hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available
to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of
the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank,
such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing
Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph
Section 2.05(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the
Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

     (e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in
respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement
not later than 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the date that such LC
Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 9:30 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on (i) the Business Day that
the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 9:30
a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than $5,000,000, the Borrower may, subject
to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan.

                                       41

<PAGE>   62

If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the
payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage
of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank
the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following
receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to
this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made
payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such
Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
applicable Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR
Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute
a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

     (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph Section 2.05(e) shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor either Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in

                                       42

<PAGE>   63

the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of an Issuing
Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), each Issuing
Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In
furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

     (g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank
has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect
to any such LC Disbursement.

     (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement,
then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the
date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear
interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made
to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at
the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the
Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section
2.05(e), then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this
paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender
pursuant to Section 2.05(e) to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank shall be
for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

     (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any
time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time
any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid
fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the
successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor, to any other Issuing Bank or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor, all other Issuing Banks and all previous Issuing
Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank
hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights and obligations

                                       43

<PAGE>   64

of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued
by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional
Letters of Credit.

     (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of
such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the
obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,
and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or 7.01(i). Each such
deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's
risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable
Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to
the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or,
if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC
Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to
the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within
three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

     SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan
to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided
in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in Dallas,
Texas and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

                                       44

<PAGE>   65

     (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.06(a) and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such
Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing, Additional
Incremental Revolving Borrowing, Term Borrowing, Incremental Term Borrowing and
Additional Incremental Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified
in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type
or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may
elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower
may elect different options with respect to different portions of a Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply
to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

     (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify
the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

     (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and Section 2.07(f):

          (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and,
     if different options are being elected with respect to different portions
     thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing
     (in which case the

                                       45

<PAGE>   66
     information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall
     be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

          (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
     Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurodollar Borrowing; and

          (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
     Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
     election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
     term "Interest Period".

     If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but
does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

     (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof
and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

     (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request
with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at
the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, then, so long as an Event of Default is
continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.

     (f) A Borrowing of any Class may not be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing if after giving effect thereto (i) the Interest Period
therefor would commence before and end after a date on which any principal of
the Loans of such Class is scheduled to be repaid and (ii) the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Eurodollar Borrowings of such Class
with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such scheduled repayment date plus
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class would
be less than the aggregate principal amount of Loans of such Class required to
be repaid on such scheduled repayment date.

     SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, (i) the Term Commitments shall terminate on the Term
Commitment Termination Date, (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on
the Revolving Maturity Date, (iii) the Incremental Tranche A Commitments shall
terminate on the Incremental Tranche A Commitment Termination Date and (iv) the
Additional

                                       46

<PAGE>   67

Incremental Commitments of any Class shall terminate on the date set forth in
the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

     (b) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08(h), the Revolving
Commitments outstanding on the Revolving Commitment Reduction Date shall be
automatically and permanently reduced in 12 consecutive installments on the last
day of each fiscal quarter (except with respect to the final reduction, which
shall be on the Revolving Maturity Date) set forth below in the percentage
amounts (expressed as a percentage of the aggregate amount of Revolving
Commitments outstanding on the Revolving Commitment Reduction Date) set forth
opposite such quarterly scheduled reduction date (or the Revolving Maturity
Date) below; provided that the final installment shall reduce the remaining
outstanding Revolving Commitments to zero on the Revolving Maturity Date and the
payment made in respect thereof shall equal the sum of (x) the then aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loans plus (y) all other unpaid amounts
owing in respect of Revolving Loans, which payment shall be due and payable not
later than the Revolving Maturity Date:

     (c) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08(h), the Additional
Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class shall be automatically and
permanently reduced on the scheduled dates, and in the scheduled amounts, if
any, set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

     (d) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce,
the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000, (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate
or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of
the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments and (iii)
the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Additional

                                       47

<PAGE>   68

Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any
concurrent prepayment of Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of such Class in
accordance with Section 2.11, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of such Class would exceed the total
Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments of such Class.

     (e) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section 2.08(d) at least three
Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction,
specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following
receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving
Commitments or the Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class
delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any
termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent.
Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.

     (f) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds in excess of
$5,000,000 are received by or on behalf of Holdings or any Subsidiary in respect
of any Prepayment Event, there shall be a pro rata reduction of Revolving
Commitments, Term Borrowings, Incremental Tranche A Borrowings and, if provided
for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement, Additional
Incremental Revolving Commitments and Additional Incremental Term Borrowings as
provided in this Section 2.08(f) and in Section 2.11(b). In such event, the
Revolving Commitments and, if provided for in the applicable Additional
Incremental Facility Agreement, Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments
shall, on the third Business Day after such Net Proceeds are received, be
automatically and permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to the
product of 100% (or, in the case of any Prepayment Event referred to in clause
(c) of the definition of Prepayment Event, if, on the date on which any
reduction would otherwise be made in respect of such Prepayment Event either (i)
the Facilities shall be rated not lower than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or
(ii) the Total Leverage Ratio as of such date is less than 3.5 to 1.0, 50%) of
such Net Proceeds and the Reduction Portion in respect of such Prepayment Event;
provided that, in the case of any event described in clause (a) or (c) of the
definition of Prepayment Event, if the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that the
Borrower intends to apply the Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof
specified in such certificate) to invest in the Telecommunications Business of
the Borrower and the other Restricted Subsidiaries within 360 days of the
receipt thereof and certifying that no Default has occurred and is continuing,
then no reduction shall be required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the
Net Proceeds in respect of such event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds
specified in such certificate, if applicable) except to the extent of any such
Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so

                                      48

<PAGE>   69

applied by the end of such period, at which time a reduction shall be required
in accordance with this paragraph (f).

     (g) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, commencing with
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, the Revolving Commitments and, if
provided for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement,
Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be automatically and
permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to the product of 50% of Excess
Cash Flow for such fiscal year and the Reduction Portion in respect of such
Excess Cash Flow; provided that if, on the date on which any reduction would
otherwise be made pursuant to this Section 2.08(g), either (i) the Facilities
shall be rated not lower than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or (ii) the Total
Leverage Ratio as of such date is less than 3.5 to 1.0, no such reduction shall
be required pursuant to this Section 2.08(g). Each reduction pursuant to this
paragraph shall be made on the date on which financial statements are delivered
pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash
Flow is being calculated (and in any event within 90 days after the end of such
fiscal year).

     (h) Any reduction of the Revolving Commitments, other than a reduction
pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(b) above, shall be applied to reduce the
subsequent scheduled reductions of Revolving Commitments to be made pursuant to
Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(b) above in reverse chronological order. Any reduction
of the Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class, other than a
reduction pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(c) above, shall be applied to
reduce the subsequent scheduled reductions of Additional Incremental Revolving
Commitments of such Class to be made pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(c) as
set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

     SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving
Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount
of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10, (iii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Incremental Lender the
then unpaid principal amount of each Incremental Tranche A Term Loan of such
Incremental Lender as set forth in Section 2.10, (iv) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount
of each Additional Incremental Loan of any Class of such Lender as set forth in
the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement and (v) to each
Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan made by
it on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such
Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is
at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made.

     (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender
resulting from

                                       49

each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

     (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

     (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to Section 2.09(b)
and 2.09(c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (e) No promissory notes evidencing Loans hereunder will be issued unless a
Lender requests that a promissory note be issued to it to evidence its Loans of
any Class. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to
such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

amount of all Term Loans plus (y) all other unpaid amounts owing in respect of
Term Loans and shall be due and payable not later than the Term Maturity Date:

     (c) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.10(e), the Borrower shall
repay Additional Incremental Term Borrowings of any Class on the scheduled
dates, and in the scheduled amounts, if any, set forth in the applicable
Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

     (d) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans shall be due and
payable on the Term Maturity Date, all Revolving Loans shall be due and payable
on the Revolving Maturity Date, all Incremental Tranche A Term Loans shall be
due and payable on the Incremental Tranche A Maturity Date and all Additional
Incremental Loans of any Class shall be due and payable on the final maturity
date set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

     (e) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing or an Incremental Term Borrowing
shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of Term
Borrowings or Incremental Term Borrowings, respectively to be made pursuant to
this Section in reverse chronological order. Any prepayment of an Additional
Incremental Term Borrowing of any Class shall be applied to reduce the
subsequent scheduled repayment of Additional Incremental Term Borrowings of such
Class to be made pursuant to this Section as set forth in the applicable
Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

     (f) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings or Incremental Term
Borrowings hereunder or any Additional Incremental Term Borrowings of any Class,
the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of such Class to be repaid
and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy)
of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, three Business
Days before the scheduled date of such repayment; provided that each repayment
of Term Borrowings or Incremental Term Borrowings or any Additional Incremental
Term Borrowings of any Class shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Term
Borrowings or ABR

                                       52

<PAGE>   73

Incremental Term Borrowings or ABR Additional Incremental Term Borrowings of
such Class before any other Borrowings of such Class. Each repayment of a
Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid
Borrowing. Repayments of Term Borrowings, Incremental Term Borrowings and
Additional Incremental Term Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest
on the amount repaid.

     SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part,
subject to the requirements of this Section. All prepayments shall be made
without premium or penalty other than, to the extent applicable, amounts payable
under Section 2.16.

     (b) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds in excess of
$5,000,000 are received by or on behalf of Holdings or any Subsidiary in respect
of any Prepayment Event, there shall be a pro rata reduction of Revolving
Commitments, Term Borrowings, Incremental Tranche A Borrowings, and if provided
for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement, Additional
Incremental Revolving Commitments and Additional Incremental Term Borrowings as
provided in this Section 2.11(b) and in Section 2.08(f). In such event, the
Borrower shall, within three Business Days after such Net Proceeds are received,
prepay Term Borrowings, Incremental Tranche A Borrowings and, if provided for in
the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement, Additional Incremental
Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to the product of 100% (or, in the
case of any Prepayment Event referred to in clause (c) of the definition of
Prepayment Event, if, on the date on which any prepayment would otherwise be
made in respect of such Prepayment Event either (i) the Facilities shall be
rated not lower than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or (ii) the Total Leverage
Ratio as of such date is less than 3.5 to 1.0, 50%) of such Net Proceeds and the
Prepayment Portion in respect of such Prepayment Event (such product, the
"Prepayment Amount"); provided that, in the case of any event described in
clause (a) or (c) of the definition of Prepayment Event, if the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the
effect that the Borrower intends to apply the Net Proceeds from such event (or a
portion thereof specified in such certificate) to invest in the
Telecommunications Business of the Borrower and the other Restricted
Subsidiaries within 360 days of the receipt thereof and certifying that no
Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be required
pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in respect of such
event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such certificate, if
applicable) except to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have
not been so applied by the end of such period, at which time a prepayment shall
be required in accordance with this paragraph (b).

     (c) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, commencing with
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, the Borrower shall prepay Term
Borrowings, Incremental Tranche A Borrowings and, if provided for in the
applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement, Additional Incremental
Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) 50% of Excess
Cash Flow for such fiscal year and (ii) the Prepayment Portion in respect of
such Excess Cash Flow (such product, the "Excess Cash Flow Prepayment Amount");
provided that if, on the date on which any

                                       53

<PAGE>   74

prepayment would otherwise be made pursuant to this Section 2.11(c), either (i)
the Facilities shall be rated not lower than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or
(ii) the Total Leverage Ratio as of such date is less than 3.5 to 1.0, no such
prepayment shall be required pursuant to this Section 2.11(c). Each prepayment
pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the date on which
financial statements are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the
fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and in any event
within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

     (d) If, on any date, the aggregate Revolving Exposures of all Lenders
exceeds the aggregate Revolving Commitments of all Lenders, or the aggregate
principal amount of the Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of any Class of
all Lenders exceeds the aggregate Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments
of such Class of all Lenders, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving
Loans or Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of such Class, as the case may
be (and, to the extent that any such excess remains after all Revolving Loans
have been prepaid, deposit cash collateral with the Administrative Agent to
secure outstanding LC Exposure), in an amount equal to such excess.

     (e) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder,
the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and shall
specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to Section
2.11(f); provided that each prepayment of Borrowings of any Class shall be
applied to prepay ABR Borrowings of such Class before any other Borrowings of
such Class.

     (f) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender) by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a
notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments or any Additional Incremental
Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a
notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall
advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as
necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans

                                       54

<PAGE>   75

included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

     SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent (i) in the case of Revolving Commitments and Term Commitments for the
account of each Lender fees for each day during the period from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates
at a rate equal to the applicable Commitment Fee Rate for such day, (ii) in the
case of Incremental Tranche A Commitments for the account of each Incremental
Tranche A Lender fees for each day during the period from and including the
Amendment No. 5 Effective Date but excluding the Incremental Tranche A
Commitment Termination Date at a rate equal to the applicable Commitment Fee
Rate for such day and (iii) in the case of any Additional Incremental Facility
Commitment, the rate set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility
Agreement for such day, in each case on the unused amount of each Commitment of
such Lender on such day (collectively, the "COMMITMENT FEES"). Accrued
Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which the applicable
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees with
respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be
deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC
Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be
disregarded for such purpose).

     (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit for each day during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which
such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any LC Exposure, which fee shall accrue at a rate equal to the
Applicable Margin on Eurodollar Revolving Loans for such day on the amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure on such day (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) and (ii) to the applicable
Issuing Bank a fronting fee in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank for each day during the period from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure in respect
of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, which shall accrue at the rate
or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Borrower and such Issuing
Bank on the amount of the LC Exposure on such day (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) in respect of Letters of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be

                                       55

<PAGE>   76

payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such
fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall
be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this
paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees
and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

     (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

     (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable
Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case
of Commitment Fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall
bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus (i) in the case of any ABR
Borrowing under the Revolving Facility, the Term Facility or the Incremental
Facility (including each Swingline Loan), the ABR Spread and, if applicable to
any loan (other than an Incremental Term Loan), the Leverage Premium (each as
set forth in "Applicable Margin") and (ii) in the case of any ABR Borrowing
under any Additional Incremental Facility, the Applicable Margin for ABR
Borrowings set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility
Agreement.

     (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at
the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus
(i) in the case of any Eurodollar Borrowing under the Revolving Facility, the
Term Facility or the Incremental Facility, the Eurodollar Spread and, if
applicable to any loan (other than an Incremental Term Loan), the Leverage
Premium (each as set forth in "Applicable Margin") and (ii) in the case of any
Eurodollar Borrowing under any Additional Incremental Facility, the Applicable
Margin for Eurodollar Borrowings set forth in the applicable Additional
Incremental Facility Agreement.

     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any
Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid
when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any ABR Loan under
the Revolving Facility, the Term Facility or the Incremental Facility, 2% plus
the highest Applicable Margin for ABR Loans plus the ABR, (ii) in the case of
overdue principal of any Eurodollar Loan under the Revolving Facility, the Term
Facility or the Incremental Facility, the higher of (x) 2% plus the highest
Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans plus the Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable to
such Eurodollar Loan on the day before payment was due and (y) the sum of 2%
plus the highest Applicable Margin for ABR Loans plus the ABR, (iii) in the case
of overdue

                                       56

<PAGE>   77

principal of or overdue interest on any Additional Incremental Loan of any
Class, the rate set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility
Agreement and (iv) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable
to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in Section 2.13(a).

     (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued
pursuant to Section 2.13(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any
repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving
Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on
the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.

     (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at
times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed
on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each
case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted
LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their
Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs.

     (a) If any Change in Law shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate), Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank; or

          (ii) impose on any Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or the
     London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
     Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
     participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost (other than
Taxes) to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to
such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether
of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

     (b) If any Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing
Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing
Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans
made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender or
Swingline Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or such
Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's,
Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's,
Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or such
Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such
reduction suffered.

     (c) A certificate of a Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, Swingline
Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in Section 2.15(a) or 2.15(b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                                       58

<PAGE>   79

     (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing
Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand
such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 120 days prior to the
date that such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

     SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of
any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(f) and is
revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event,
the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date
of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of
interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other
banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

     SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as

                                       59

<PAGE>   80

the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and
Issuing Bank, within 15 days after the date of receipt of a written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or Issuing Bank, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Bank,
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

     (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction
of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is
located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), on or prior to the first payment by the Borrower under
this Agreement to such Foreign Lender or Participant and from time to time
thereafter as prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
reduced rate.

     (f) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received
a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower
(but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid,
by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes
giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant

                                       60

<PAGE>   81

Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the
Borrower, upon request of such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event such Lender is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained
in this Section 2.17(f) shall require any Lender to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

     (g) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the contrary in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (including any schedule or exhibit to any
of the foregoing), this Section 2.17 (and Section 10.04 insofar as it relates to
this Section 2.17) shall constitute the complete and exclusive understanding of
the parties in respect of all matters relating to any Taxes (including interest
thereon, additions thereto and penalties in connection therewith).

     SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or
under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at Dallas, Texas,
except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be
made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other
Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day (unless, in the case of payments in respect of
Eurodollar Loans, such next succeeding Business Day would fall in the next
calendar month, in which case such payment shall be due on the next preceding
Business Day), and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest
thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under
each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

     (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

                                       61

<PAGE>   82

     (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim
or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any
of its Loans (other than Swingline Loans) or participations in LC Disbursements
or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater
proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement (including without limitation pursuant to Section 2.11) or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set- off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

     (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable
Issuing Bank or Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or Issuing
Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.

     (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or 2.05(e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c),
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision

                                       62

<PAGE>   83

hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such
Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

     SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to
pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with
any such designation or assignment.

     (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline
Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender
shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, (i) as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply or (ii) such Lender elects to withdraw its request.

     SECTION 2.20. Additional Incremental Facilities and Commitments. (a) At any
time prior to December 31, 2002, and so long as no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, the Borrower
may request, on one or more occasions, by notice to the Administrative Agent and
the Incremental Facility Arrangers, that one or more Lenders (and/or one or more
other Persons which shall

                                       63

<PAGE>   84

become Lenders as provided in Section 2.20(d) below) provide one or more
additional facilities (each, an "Additional Incremental Facility"), each of
which shall provide for commitments (the "Additional Incremental Commitments")
in an aggregate amount of not less than $100,000,000 and all of which Additional
Incremental Facilities shall provide for Additional Incremental Commitments in
an aggregate amount not in excess of $500,000,000; provided that no Lender shall
have any obligation to provide any Additional Incremental Commitment and any
Lender (or any other Person which becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(d)
below) may provide Additional Incremental Commitments without the consent of any
other Lender.

     (b) The maturity date, scheduled amortization and commitment reductions,
mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions, interest rate, minimum
borrowings and prepayments, commitment fees and other amounts payable in respect
of any Additional Incremental Facility, and certain agent determinations, shall
be as set forth in an agreement (an "Additional Incremental Facility Agreement")
among the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, each Incremental Facility
Arranger (but only if it is acting in the capacity of joint lead arranger with
respect to such Additional Incremental Facility) and the Lenders and other
Persons agreeing to provide Additional Incremental Commitments thereunder;
provided that any term Incremental Loans (the "Additional Incremental Term
Loans") shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity of no less than the
Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term Loans then outstanding and any
revolving Incremental Commitment (the "Additional Incremental Revolving
Commitments" and any loans made pursuant thereto, the "Additional Incremental
Revolving Loans") shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity of not less
than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Revolving Commitments then
outstanding.

     (c) [Intentionally deleted]

     (d) The effectiveness of any Additional Incremental Facility to be created
under this Section 2.20, and the obligation of any Lender or other Person
providing any Additional Incremental Commitment thereunder to make any
Additional Incremental Loans pursuant thereto, is subject to, in addition to the
conditions set forth in Article 4, the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions: each Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, each Incremental Facility
Arranger (but only if it is acting in the capacity of joint lead arranger with
respect to such Additional Incremental Facility) and each Lender or other Person
providing Additional Incremental Commitments thereunder (each, an "Additional
Incremental Lender") shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative
Agent an Additional Incremental Facility Agreement with respect to such
Additional Incremental Facility, (x) the Administrative Agent shall have
received, and (y) the Administrative Agent shall have received for the
respective accounts of any other agents and the Additional Incremental Lenders,
all fees and other amounts payable by the Borrower in respect of such Additional
Incremental Facility on or prior to such date of effectiveness and the
Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received such documents and
certificates, and such legal opinions, as the Administrative Agent and the
Incremental Facility Arrangers or their counsel shall reasonably request,
including documents, certificates and legal opinions relating to the
organization, existence and good

                                       64

<PAGE>   85

standing of each Loan Party, the authorization of such Additional Incremental
Facility and other legal matters relating to the Loan Parties or the Loan
Documents (including the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement).
The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of
each Additional Incremental Facility hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Each of Holdings and the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders
that:

     SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

     SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be entered
into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate powers and have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder
action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Holdings
and the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan
Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Holdings, the Borrower or
such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

     SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do
not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any
other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained
or made and are in full force and effect and except filings necessary to perfect
Liens created under the Loan Documents (if any), (b) will not violate any
applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon Holdings or any Restricted
Subsidiary or any of their respective assets, or give rise to a right thereunder
to require any payment to be made by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, and
(d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, except Liens created under the Loan
Documents (if any).

                                       65

<PAGE>   86

     SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) Holdings
has heretofore furnished to the Lenders Holdings' consolidated balance sheet and
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows as of and for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000,
reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants. Such financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and
results of operations and cash flows of Holdings and the Subsidiaries as of such
dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP.

     (b) Holdings has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its pro forma
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and projected pro forma
statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2001, prepared giving effect to (x) the Transactions under the Incremental
Facility and the Structured Note Financing and (y) the transactions described in
clause (x) and, in addition, the sale of its Williams Communications Solutions
business unit, as if such events had occurred on such date or on the first day
of such fiscal year, as the case may be. Such projected pro forma consolidated
balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows (i) have been
prepared in good faith based on the same assumptions used to prepare the pro
forma financial statements included in the Information Memorandum (which
assumptions are believed by Holdings and the Borrower to be reasonable), (ii)
are based on the best information available to Holdings and the Borrower after
due inquiry, (iii) accurately reflect all adjustments necessary to give effect
to the Transactions under the Incremental Facility and the Structured Note
Financing and, in the case of one such set of financial statements, the sale of
its Williams Communications Solutions business unit, and (iv) present fairly, in
all material respects, the pro forma financial position of Holdings and the
Subsidiaries as of such date and for such periods as if the Transactions, the
Structured Note Financing and, in the case of one such set of financial
statements, the sale of its Williams Communications Solutions business unit had
occurred on such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be.

     (c) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above or
the notes thereto or in the Information Memorandum and except for the Disclosed
Matters, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of Holdings or any
Restricted Subsidiary has, as of the Effective Date, any material contingent
liabilities, unusual material long-term commitments or unrealized material
losses.

     (d) The projections delivered to the Lenders on the Amendment No. 5
Effective Date (the "Projections") were based on assumptions believed by the
Borrower and Holdings in good faith to be reasonable when made and as of their
date represented the Borrower's and Holdings' good faith estimate of future
performance of Holdings and the Subsidiaries and of the Borrower and its
consolidated subsidiaries.

     (e) Since December 31, 2000, there has been no Material Adverse Change.

     SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real
and personal property material

                                       66

<PAGE>   87

to its business (including its Mortgaged Properties, if any), except for minor
defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business
as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended

Subsidiary is subject to any Lien other than Permitted Encumbrances, Liens
created by the Collateral Documents (if any) and other Liens permitted under
Section 6.02.

     (b) Each of Holdings and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property
material to its business, and the use thereof by Holdings and the Subsidiaries
does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property that is
owned or leased by Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party (other than
the Parent) as of the Effective Date after giving effect to the Transactions.

     SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower,
threatened against or affecting Holdings or any Subsidiary (i) as to which there
is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii)
that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

     (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any other
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither Holdings nor any Subsidiary (i)
has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply
with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law,
(ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received
written notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv)

Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

     SECTION 3.09. Taxes. Each of Holdings and the Subsidiaries has timely filed
or caused to be filed (or the Parent has filed or caused to be filed) all Tax

been paid by or with respect to it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Holdings or such Subsidiary,
as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected
to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which
liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $25,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $25,000,000 the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

     SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. Holdings and the Borrower have disclosed to the
Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which
Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is subject, and all other matters known to
any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information
Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or
other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to any Agent or
any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented
by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided that, with respect to projected financial information, Holdings and the
Borrower represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

     SECTION 3.12. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of, and the
direct or indirect ownership interest of Holdings or the Borrower in, each
Subsidiary and

                                       68

insurance maintained by or on behalf of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, all premiums in respect of

     SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Effective Date, there are no
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary
pending or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower, threatened. The hours
worked by and payments made to employees of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters.
All payments due from Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, or for which any
claim may be made against Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, on account of
wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions and the Reorganization has not
and will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on
the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement by which
Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound.

     SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Effective Date and immediately following the making
of each Loan made on the Effective Date and after giving effect to the
application of the proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of
each Loan Party will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent
or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of each Loan
Party will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c)
each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have unreasonably small capital with
which to conduct the business in which it is engaged as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Effective Date.

     SECTION 3.16. No Burdensome Restrictions. No contract, lease, agreement or
other instrument to which Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their property is bound or affected, no charge, corporate
restriction, judgment, decree or order and no provision of applicable law or
governmental regulation could reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 3.17. Representations in Loan Documents True and Correct. As of the
dates when made and as of the Effective Date, each representation and warranty
of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary party thereto contained in any Loan
Document is true and correct.

         SECTION 6.20. Financial Covenant Non-Compliance Cure. (a) At any time
prior to the consummation of the Spin-Off, in the event that Holdings and the
Restricted Subsidiaries fail to comply with any of Sections 6.15 through 6.19,
inclusive, for any period or on any date set forth therein, the Parent shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to make, within three Business Days of
the date upon which financial statements as of the last day of such period are
delivered or required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), a cash
equity contribution to Holdings in exchange for

                                       95

<PAGE>   116

Qualifying Equity Interests of Holdings (which Holdings shall thereupon
contribute to the Borrower, in exchange for Qualifying Equity Interests of the
Borrower) to cure such failure.

         (b) If such contribution is made to cure a failure to comply with the
covenant contained in Section 6.16, such contribution shall be in an amount
sufficient, when added to EBITDA for the applicable period, to enable Holdings
and the Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with such covenant on a consolidated
basis. Upon the making of any such capital contribution to Holdings and to the
Borrower in the amount specified above, the amount so contributed (to the
extent, but only to the extent, of the shortfall in EBITDA for the applicable
period) shall thereafter be deemed to have been EBITDA in the last fiscal
quarter of such period for purposes of all calculations in respect of compliance
with Section 6.16 thereafter.

         (c) If such contribution is made to cure a failure to comply with a
covenant contained in Section 6.15, 6.17, 6.18 or 6.19, such contribution shall
be in an amount sufficient, when applied to repay or prepay Indebtedness of
Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries, to enable Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such contribution and
application, to comply with such covenant on a consolidated basis.

         (d) The right to cure provided in THIS SECTION 6.20 may not be
exercised in respect of more than two consecutive quarters or more than three
times in the aggregate during the term of the Facilities.

notice, the lapse of time or both) the holder or holders of any Material
Indebtedness or Permitted Receivables Financing or any trustee or agent on its

securing such Indebtedness;

         (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary

periods;

         (m) any Lien (if any) purported to be created under any Collateral

                                   THE AGENTS

         SECTION 8.01. Appointment, Powers, Immunities. (a) Each Lender,
Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative
Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions
on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto.

         (b) The institutions serving as Agents hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers in their capacities as Lenders, Swingline Lenders or Issuing
Banks, as the case may be, as any other Lenders, Swingline Lenders or Issuing
Banks and may exercise the same as though they were not Agents, and each such
institution and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.

         (c) The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) the Agents shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other
implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing,
(ii) the Agents shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that an Agent is required to
exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in
Section 10.02), and (iii) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents,
the Agents shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings or any Subsidiary that
is communicated to or obtained by any institution serving as an Agent or any of
its affiliates in any capacity.

                                       99

<PAGE>   120

         (d) No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.

         (e) No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by Holdings, the
Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than, in the case of the
Administrative Agent, to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 8.02. Reliance by Agents. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         SECTION 8.03. Delegation to Sub-Agents. Each Agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise any of its rights and powers by or through any
one or more sub- agents appointed by such Agent. The Agents and any such
sub-agents may perform any and all of their duties and exercise rights and
powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of
the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.

         SECTION 8.04. Resignation of Agents. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, any Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the
Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank organized under
the laws of the United States or any State thereof, having (x) an office in any
State of the United States and (y) capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating at least $200,000,000, or an

                                       100

<PAGE>   121

affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.
The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those
payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting
as Agent.

         SECTION 8.05. Non-reliance on Agents or other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         SECTION 8.06. Syndication Agent, Incremental Facility Arrangers and Co-
Documentation Agents. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan
Document to the contrary, the Syndication Agent, the Incremental Facility
Arrangers and the Co-Documentation Agents shall have no obligation or
responsibility as such hereunder other than, in the case of the Syndication
Agent or the Incremental Facility Arrangers, as expressly set forth herein.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                               HOLDINGS GUARANTEE

         SECTION 9.01. The Guarantee. Holdings unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the full and punctual payment of all present and future indebtedness
and other obligations of the Borrower evidenced by or arising under any Loan
Document and all present and future indebtedness and other obligations of the
Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary under any Hedging Agreement
permitted under Section 6.01 (a "Specified Hedging Agreement") as and when the
same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity or by declaration or
otherwise, according to the terms hereof and thereof (including, without
limitation, any Post-Petition Interest). If the Borrower or any other Restricted
Subsidiary fails punctually to pay any indebtedness or other obligation
guaranteed hereby which is due and payable, Holdings unconditionally agrees to
cause such payment to be made punctually as and when the same shall become due
and payable, whether at maturity or by declaration or otherwise, and as if such
payment were made by the Borrower or such other Restricted Subsidiary.

                                       101

<PAGE>   122

         SECTION 9.02. Guarantee Unconditional. The obligations of Holdings
under THIS ARTICLE 9 shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:

                  (a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
         release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan
         Party under any Loan Document or Specified Hedging Agreement, by
         operation of law or otherwise;

                  (b) any modification, amendment or waiver of or supplement to
         any Loan Document or Specified Hedging Agreement;

                  (c) any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of
         any direct or indirect security, or of any guarantee or other liability
         of any third party, for any obligation of the Borrower or any Loan
         Party under any Loan Document or Specified Hedging Agreement;

                  (d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or
         ownership of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any insolvency,
         bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the
         Borrower or any other Loan Party or its assets, or any resulting
         release or discharge of any obligation of the Borrower or any other
         Loan Party contained in any Loan Document or Specified Hedging
         Agreement;

                  (e) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which
         Holdings may have at any time against the Borrower or any other Loan
         Party, any Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person,
         whether or not arising in connection herewith or any unrelated
         transaction; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion
         of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

                  (f) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against
         the Borrower or any other Loan Party for any reason of any Loan
         Document or Specified Hedging Agreement, or any provision of applicable
         law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any other Loan
         Party of any amount payable by it under any Loan Document or Specified
         Hedging Agreement; or

                  (g) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by
         any other Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person or any other
         circumstance that might, but for the provisions of this Section,
         constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Holdings' obligations
         under THIS ARTICLE 9.

         SECTION 9.03. Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in
Certain Circumstances. Holdings' obligations under THIS ARTICLE 9 constitute a
continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect until the
Commitments shall have been terminated, all Letters of Credit shall have expired
or been terminated, all Specified Hedging Agreements shall have been terminated
and all amounts payable under the Loan Documents and the Specified Hedging
Agreements shall have been indefeasibly paid in

                                       102

<PAGE>   123

full. If at any time any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document
or by the Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary under any Specified
Hedging Agreement is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise,
Holdings' obligations under THIS ARTICLE 9 WITH respect to such payment shall be
reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but had not been
made at such time.

         SECTION 9.04. Waiver. Holdings irrevocably waives acceptance hereof,
presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as
any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the
Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary or any other Person.

         SECTION 9.05. Subrogation. When Holdings makes any payment under THIS
ARTICLE 9 with respect to the obligations of the Borrower or any other
Restricted Subsidiary, Holdings shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee
against the Borrower or such other Restricted Subsidiary with respect to the
portion of such obligations paid by Holdings; provided that Holdings shall not
enforce any payment by way of subrogation or contribution against the Borrower
or any Subsidiary so long as any amount payable under any Loan Document or
Specified Hedging Agreement remains unpaid.

         SECTION 9.06. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for
payment of any amount payable by any Loan Party under any Loan Document or
Specified Hedging Agreement is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of such Loan Party, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of such Loan Document or Specified Hedging
Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by Holdings under THIS ARTICLE 9

hereof or, in the case of obligations under a Specified Hedging Agreement, at
the request of the relevant Lender or Lenders or affiliate or affiliates of such
Lender or Lenders.

         SECTION 9.07. Successors and Assigns. This guarantee is for the benefit
of the Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties and their respective successors and
assigns. If any Loans, participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans or
other amounts payable under the Loan Documents are assigned pursuant to Section

Agreement are assigned pursuant thereto, the rights under THIS ARTICLE 9, to the
extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, shall be transferred with
such indebtedness.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or
overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by

Pamela Kurtzman, 64th Floor (Telecopy No. (214) 209-9390) or (for Borrowing
Requests) Judy Schneidmiller, 14th Floor (Telecopy No. 214-209-2118);

         (g) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number)

         Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices
and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All
notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date
of receipt.

         SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by

                                       104

<PAGE>   125

Section 10.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether
the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

         (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that
are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender
without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce
any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or 2.18(c)
in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,
without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of
this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of
any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of
any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release
Holdings or substantially all of the Subsidiary Loan Parties from their
respective Guarantees hereunder under the Subsidiary Guarantee (except as
expressly provided herein or therein), or limit its liability in respect of such
Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) change any
condition set forth in Section 4.03 without the written consent of each
Incremental Lender, or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a
manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due
to, or requirements to make loans by, Lenders holding Loans of any Class
differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the written
consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and
unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided further that (A) no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, the affected Issuing Bank or the
affected Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or
modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties
under this Agreement of the Lenders with Commitments or Loans of any Class or
Classes (but not Lenders with Commitments or Loans of any other Class or
Classes) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by Holdings, the Borrower and the requisite percentage in interest of the
Lenders with Commitments or Loans of the affected Class or Classes.

         SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Incremental Facility
Arrangers and their respective affiliates, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent and the Incremental Facility Arrangers in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and
(iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers, any Issuing Bank, any
Swingline Lender or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of
any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers and
the Syndication Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection
with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

         (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers, the Issuing Banks, the
Swingline Lenders and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of
their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions
or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit
or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank
to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents
presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by Holdings or any
Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to Holdings or any
Subsidiary, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

                                       106

<PAGE>   127

         (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers,
any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender under Sections 10.03(a) or 10.03(b),
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication
Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline
Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the
Incremental Facility Arrangers, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender in its
capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be
determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures,
outstanding Loans (other than Revolving Loans) and unused Commitments (other
than Revolving Commitments) at the time.

         (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Holdings and the
Borrower will not and will not permit any other Restricted Subsidiary to assert,
and each hereby waives for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or
Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

         (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after
written demand therefor.

         SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender, each Issuing Bank
and each Swingline Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline
Lenders and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or
by reason of this Agreement.

         (b) (1) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i)
each of the Borrower (except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
affiliate of a Lender) and Administrative Agent (except in the case of an
assignment to an affiliate of a Lender) (and, in the case of an assignment of
all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any Lender's obligations in
respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the Issuing

                                       107

<PAGE>   128

Banks and the Swingline Lenders) must give its prior written consent to such
assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in
the case of an assignment to a Lender or an affiliate of a Lender or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitments
or Loans, after giving effect to such assignment, the amount of the Commitments
or Loans of each Class held by each of the assignor Lender and its affiliates
and the assignee Lender and its affiliates (determined in each case as of the
date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that THIS
SECTION 10.04(b)(iii) shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in
respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans, (iv) the parties to each
assignment (excluding any assignment by a Lender to an affiliate of such Lender)
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, (v) the
parties to each assignment by a Lender to an affiliate of such Lender shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $1,500, (vi) the assignee, if
it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire and (vii) the Incremental Facility Arrangers shall
be notified by the Administrative Agent of any assignment of the Incremental
Facility; and provided further that any consent of the Borrower otherwise
required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant
to Section 10.04(d), from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section
10.04(e). Each Lender that is an investment fund hereby agrees to notify the
Administrative Agent and the Incremental Facility Arrangers of any change of the
identity of the investment manager for such fund.

         (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
"SPC") identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower
all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be
obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails

                                       108

<PAGE>   129

to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated
to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC
hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same
extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain
with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it
will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against,
such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In
addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in THIS SECTION
10.04, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of,
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This section may not
be amended without the written consent of each SPC that, at the time of such
proposed amendment, has an outstanding Loan or Loans to the Borrower. For
purposes of Section 10.02 of this Agreement and any other provision of any Loan
Document requiring the consent or approval of any Lender, the Granting Lender
shall, notwithstanding the funding of any Loans by any SPC, have the sole right
to consent to or approve any waiver or amendment of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or to exercise any other right to consent
or to grant approval under any Loan Document.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in any State of the United
States, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Holdings, the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

         (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 10.04(b)
and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 10.04(b), the
Administrative Agent shall accept such

                                       109

<PAGE>   130

Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

         (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Holdings, the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to Section 10.04(f), the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.04(b). To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

         (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as
though it were a Lender.

         (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         SECTION 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any

                                       110

<PAGE>   131

other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other
parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit,
regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf
and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any
Swingline Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal
of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable
under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is
outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article 8 shall survive
and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of
this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         SECTION 10.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other
Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable
to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank constitute the entire contract
among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall
become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto,
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         SECTION 10.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender and
each of their respective affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender, Issuing
Bank, Swingline Lender or affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower or Holdings against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or
Holdings, as the case may be, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
held by such Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, irrespective of

                                       111

<PAGE>   132

whether or not such Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender may have.

         SECTION 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

         (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline
Lender or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the
Borrower or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

         (c) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in Section 10.09(b). Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

         (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of

Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A

<PAGE>   133

REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         SECTION 10.11. Headings. Article and Section headings used herein and
the Table of Contents are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its affiliates' (other than affiliates that are
direct competitors of any material business of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement (other than a direct competitor of any material business of Holdings
and the Restricted Subsidiaries), (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to
the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than Holdings or the Borrower. For the
purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from
Holdings or the Borrower relating to Holdings or the Borrower or its business,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent,
any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
prior to disclosure by Holdings or the Borrower; provided that, in the case of
information received from Holdings or the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

         SECTION 10.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees,

                                       113

<PAGE>   134

charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under
applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful
rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received
or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law,
the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with
all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate
and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable
in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of
this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such
Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above
the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest
thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have
been received by such Lender.

written.
