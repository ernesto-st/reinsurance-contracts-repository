The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account  of each Borrower maintained with Citibank for each payment of principal, interest and fees  owing by such Borrower as it becomes due hereunder.   2.13. Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.  (a) Each Lender shall maintain  in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each  Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time,  including the currency and amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender  from time to time hereunder.  (b) The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will  record (i) the currency and amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and  the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due  and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder  and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from  each Borrower and each Lender&#8217;s share thereof.  (c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs  (a)  and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the  Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative  Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any  manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with  their terms; provided further, that in the event of any conflict between the accounts  maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the accounts maintained by the  Administrative Agent in the Register shall control.  (d) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note  in substantially the form of Exhibit A (including any amendment, modification, renewal  or replacement thereof, a &#8220;Note&#8221;).  In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute  and deliver to such Lender such Note payable to such Lender.  Thereafter, the Loans  evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any  assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the  payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that  any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and  requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (a) and (b)  above.  Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of any Lender as to the loss, theft,  destruction or mutilation of such Lender&#8217;s Note, and, in the case of any such loss, theft,  destruction or mutilation, upon cancellation of such Note, each Borrower will issue, in  lieu thereof, a replacement Note in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of  like tenor.   2.14.

If the written confirmation differs in any material  respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent demonstrable error.   2.15. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  (a) Interest accrued on each  Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first  such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which an Alternate Base Rate Advance is  prepaid (with respect to the principal so prepaid), whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and  at maturity.  Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Alternate  Base Rate Advance converted into a Term SOFR Advance on a day other than a Payment Date  shall be payable on the date of conversion.  Interest accrued on each Term SOFR Advance and  each Eurocurrency Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on  any date on which the Term SOFR Advance or the Eurocurrency Advance is prepaid (with  respect to the principal so prepaid), whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.   Interest accrued on each Term SOFR Advance and each Eurocurrency Advance having an  Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three- month interval during such Interest Period.  Interest accrued on each SONIA Advance shall be  payable in arrears on the last day of each month, on any date on which the SONIA Advance is  prepaid (with respect to the principal so prepaid), whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at  maturity.  Interest with respect to Term SOFR Loans, Eurocurrency Loans and facility fees shall  be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.  Interest with respect to  Alternate Base Rate Advances and SONIA Advances shall be calculated for the actual days  elapsed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable.  Interest shall be payable for the day  an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is made  in full and received prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York time) at the place of payment.  If any  payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a  Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case  of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in  connection with such payment.  (b) With respect to any Term SOFR Advances and SONIA Advances, the  Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time  and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any  amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any  further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect  to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such  amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrowers and the Lenders  reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.     2.16. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment  Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of  the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice,  Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.

Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending  Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time,  which Lending Installation may include any Affiliate of such Lender or any domestic or foreign  branch of such Lender or such Affiliate.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such  Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each  Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender may, by written notice to  the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative in accordance with Article XIII,  designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by  it will be issued by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.   2.18. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless a Borrower or a  Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the time at which it is  scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the  proceeds of a Loan, or (b) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to  the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such  payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.  The  Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment  available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Lender or such  Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent,  the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the  Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of  each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the  Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per  annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in  the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the  Administrative Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Loans denominated in Committed  Currencies for such day for the first three (3) days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to  the relevant Loan or (ii) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the  relevant Loan.   2.19. Increase in the Aggregate Commitments.  (a) The Borrower Representative may,  at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the latest Facility  Termination Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent, request that the Aggregate  Commitment be increased by an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a  &#8220;Commitment Increase&#8221;) to be effective as of a date that is at least thirty (30) days prior to the  latest scheduled Facility Termination Date (or such later date as the Administrative Agent may  agree) then in effect (the &#8220;Increase Date&#8221;) as specified in the related notice to the Administrative  Agent; provided, however that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitments at  any time exceed $1,600,000,000 and (ii) on the date of any request by the Borrower  Representative for a Commitment Increase and on the related Increase Date the applicable  conditions set forth in Article IV shall be satisfied.

There are no pending or, to the knowledge of any officer of a Loan Party,  threatened claims, actions, investigations or lawsuits against any Plan, any fiduciary thereof, or  such Loan Party or any member of the Controlled Group with respect to a Plan which would  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

The  present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each Permitted UK Defined  Benefit Pension Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not exceed the fair market value of the assets  of such Permitted UK Defined Benefit Pension Plan, in each case as of the date of the  most recent financial statements prior to the date hereof reflecting such amounts, except  where any underfunding of the Permitted UK Defined Benefit Pension Plans (based on  the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  87) as of such date would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the making  of any Advance hereunder nor the use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with  the provisions of Regulation T, U or X.   5.11. Investment Company.

Environmental Laws.  There are no claims, investigations, litigation,  administrative proceedings, notices, requests for information, whether pending or, to the  knowledge of any officer of a Loan Party, threatened, or judgments or orders asserting violations  of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and safety statutes, regulations,  ordinances, codes, rules, orders, decrees, directives and standards (&#8220;Environmental Laws&#8221;) or  alleging potential liability or responsibility under Environmental Laws relating to any toxic or  hazardous waste, substance or chemical or any pollutant, contaminant, chemical or other  substance defined or regulated pursuant to any Environmental Law, including, without  limitation, asbestos, petroleum, crude oil or any fraction thereof (&#8220;Hazardous Materials&#8221;)  asserted against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries which, in any case, would reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

All representations and warranties of the Parent  contained in this Agreement or of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary contained in any Loan  Document shall survive the making of the Credit Extensions herein contemplated.   9.2. Governmental Regulation.  Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to any Borrower in violation of  any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation.   9.3. Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience of  reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Loan  Documents.   9.4. Entire Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and  understanding among the Parent, the other Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the  Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Parent, the other Loan  Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other  than the fee letter described in Section 10.10.   9.5. Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The respective obligations of  the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any  other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such).  The  failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other  Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed so as to  confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their  respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that  each of the Arrangers shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.09 to  the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its  own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.   9.6. Expenses; Indemnification.  (a) The Parent shall reimburse the Administrative  Agent and the Arrangers for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and  reasonably documented attorneys&#8217; fees and time charges of one primary counsel and, if  reasonably necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction material to the interests of  the Lenders taken as a whole (which may be a single counsel acting in multiple material  jurisdictions) for the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers) paid or incurred by the  Administrative Agent or the Arrangers in connection with the preparation, negotiation,  execution, delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet),  review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents.

It shall be a condition precedent to the foregoing indemnity   obligations that each Indemnified Party seeking indemnity hereunder agree to return to  the Parent amounts received when any of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) of the  immediately preceding sentence apply.  In the case of an investigation, litigation or other  proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph  applies, such indemnity will be  effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the  Parent, any of its directors, security holders or creditors, an Indemnified Party or any  other person or an Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the  transactions contemplated hereby are consummated; provided, however, that as to any  Indemnified Party, such indemnity shall not be effective with respect to any litigation or  proceeding brought by such Indemnified Party to the extent such litigation or proceeding  results in an final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction against  such Indemnified Party.

This  Section 9.6 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent  losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.   9.7. Judgments.

Exculpatory Provisions.  (a) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties  or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its  duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, the Administrative Agent:  (i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,  regardless of whether a Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is  continuing;  (ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise  any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly  contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative  Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or  such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for  herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent  shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its  counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to  any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any  action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law  or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a  Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and  (iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan  Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to  disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates that is  communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent  or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent  also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have  been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In  determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms  must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such  condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received  notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative  Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent  accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not  taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.   10.5. Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its  duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or  through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative  Agent and any such subagent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and  powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article  shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any  such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of  the Commitments as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall  not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a  court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the  Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such  sub-agents.   10.6.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent  demonstrable error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the  Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement  notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest  in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender,  including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided  that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations  hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.   12.6. CompetitorsDisqualified Lenders.  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained in this Agreement, no assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was  a CompetitorDisqualified Lender as of the date (the &#8220;Trade Date&#8221;) on which the assigning  Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and  obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Borrower Representative has  consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such  Person will not be considered a CompetitorDisqualified Lender for the purpose of such  assignment or participation).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that  becomes a CompetitorDisqualified Lender after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result  of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in,  the definition of &#8220;CompetitorDisqualified Lender&#8221;), (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be  disqualified from becoming a Lender and (y) the execution by the Borrower Representative of an  Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such  assignee no longer being considered a CompetitorDisqualified Lender.  Any assignment in  violation of this clause 12.6(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this Section 12.6  shall apply.  (ii) If any assignment or participation is made to any  CompetitorDisqualified Lender without the Borrower Representative&#8217;s prior  written consent in violation of clause (i) above, or if any Person becomes a  CompetitorDisqualified Lender after the applicable Trade Date, the Borrower  Representative may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable  </FONT></DIV>

This Guaranty shall  not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any  instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by any fact or circumstance relating to  the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of any Guarantor  under this Guaranty (other than payment thereof), and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives  any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the  foregoing.  For the avoidance of doubt, the respective obligations of each Borrower are several  and not joint, except to the extent such Borrower is providing a guarantee as a Guarantor.

To  effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the  Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor  under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in  the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting such  fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other similarly avoidable or invalid transaction.  (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the  event any payment shall be required to be made to the Administrative Agent or any  Lender under this Guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent  permitted by law, such amounts to the other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate  amount paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this  Agreement.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or  failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such  Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of  such Guarantor.   15.4. Certain Waivers and Acknowledgements.  (a) Each Guarantor waives (i) any  defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower, or the cessation  from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Lenders, the Administrative  Agent or any indemnified party) of the liability of such Borrower; (ii) any defense based on any  claim that such Guarantor&#8217;s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any  Borrower; (iii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor&#8217;s liability  hereunder; (iv) any right to proceed against any Borrower or pursue any other remedy in the  power of any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party whatsoever until the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received payment in full in respect of the  Obligations; and (v) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits  that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating  guarantors or sureties.  Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all  presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance,  protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or  nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty  or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations.  (b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right  to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and  applies to all Obligations of each Borrower, whether existing now or in the future.  (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any  defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by  the Administrative Agent or any Lender that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or  otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or  indemnification rights of such Guarantor or other rights of such Guarantor to proceed  against any other Person and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or  counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.  (d) Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and  indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents  and that the waivers set forth in Section 15.0215.2 and this Section 15.0415.4 are  knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.  (e) The waivers of each Guarantor set forth in this Section 15.0415.4 are  made to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.   15.5. Obligations Independent.

Subrogation.  No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution,  indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this  Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been  indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments are terminated.  If any amounts are  paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in  trust for the benefit of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party and shall  forthwith be paid to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party to reduce  the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.   15.7. Termination; Reinstatement.  This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable  guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect  until the later of (a) all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are  indefeasibly paid in full in cash and (b) the Facility Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the  foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be,  if any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any of the Lenders  or any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party exercises its right of setoff, in  respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is  subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required  (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Lenders, the Administrative  Agent or any indemnified party in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other  party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if  such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Lenders,  the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party are in possession of or have released this  Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The  obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.   15.8. Stay Of Acceleration.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the  Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Borrower under  any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each  Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any  indemnified party.   15.9. Condition Of Borrowers.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the  sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers such  information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers as such  Guarantor requires, and that none of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified  party has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Lenders, the Administrative Agent  or any indemnified party at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to  the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers (each Guarantor waiving any  duty on the part of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party to disclose  such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).   15.10.

Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or  proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the  judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

The Parent and each other Loan Party irrevocably and  unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection  that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court  referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably  waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient  forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.  (c) Service of Process.  Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of  process in the manner provided for notices in Section 13.1.  Nothing in this Agreement  will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by  applicable law.  (d) Agent for Service of Process.  Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably  appoints Aon Corporation as its agent for service of process with respect to all of the  Loan Documents and all other related agreements to which it is a party (the &#8220;Process  Agent&#8221;) and Aon Corporation hereby accepts such appointment as the Process Agent and  hereby agrees to forward promptly to the Parent all legal process addressed to the Parent  received by the Process Agent.  Each Loan Party hereby agrees that the failure of Aon  Corporation to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity  of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon.   To the extent that each Designated Subsidiary has or hereafter may acquire any immunity  from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or  notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or  otherwise) with respect to itself or its Property, each Designated Subsidiary hereby  irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement.   16.3. Designated Subsidiaries.  (a) Designation.  The Parent may at any time, and from  time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days&#8217; notice in the case of any Subsidiary so  designated after the Effective Date, notify the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify  the Lenders) that the Parent intends to designate a Subsidiary as a &#8220;Designated Subsidiary&#8221; for  purposes of this Agreement.  On or after the date that is 15 Business Days after such notice, upon  delivery to the Administrative Agent and each Lender of a Designation Agreement duly executed  by the Parent and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto,  such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a &#8220;Designated Subsidiary&#8221; for purposes of this  Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder.   The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Parent&#8217;s notice of such  pending designation by the Parent and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.  Following the  giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 16.3(a), if the designation of such Designated  Subsidiary obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with &#8220;know your  customer&#8221; or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information  is not already available to it, the Parent shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative  Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested  by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender  to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary &#8220;know your  customer&#8221; or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.  </FONT></DIV>

As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Parent or the Administrative Agent  of the Parent&#8217;s intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary, and in any event no  later than ten Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Subsidiary that is  organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political  subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of  and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary, either directly or through  an Affiliate of such Lender selected pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph (a  &#8220;Protesting Lender&#8221;) shall so notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent in writing.  With  respect to each Protesting Lender, the Parent shall, effective on or before the date that such  Designated Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the  Administrative Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting  Lender shall be terminated; provided that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of  an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued  fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such  outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Parent or the relevant Designated  Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such  Subsidiary as a &#8220;Designated Subsidiary&#8221; hereunder.  (b) Termination.  Upon the payment and performance in full of all of the  indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes of any  Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Borrowing Notice in respect of such  Designated Subsidiary is outstanding, such Subsidiary&#8217;s status as a &#8220;Designated  Subsidiary&#8221; shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Administrative Agent to  the Lenders (which notice the Administrative Agent shall give promptly upon its receipt  of a request therefor from the Parent).  Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no further  obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary.   16.4. Substitution of Currency.  If a change in any Committed Currency occurs  pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi- national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definition of Eurocurrency  Rate) will be amended to the extent determined by the Administrative Agent (acting reasonably  and in consultation with the Borrower Representative) to be necessary to reflect the change in  currency and to put the Lenders and the Borrowers in the same position, so far as possible, that  they would have been in if no change in such Committed Currency had occurred.   16.5. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH LOAN PARTY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL  PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER  SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,  RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE  RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.  </FONT></DIV>
