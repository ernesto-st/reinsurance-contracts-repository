                                     between
                          XL MID OCEAN REINSURANCE LTD
                                       and
                       ANNUITY AND LIFE REASSURANCE, LTD.

BUSINESS REINSURED

         Retrocession of portions of the business reinsured to XL Mid Ocean
         Reinsurance Ltd ("XLMO") from Old Mutual Life Assurance Company Ltd.
         ("Old Mutual") under agreement number LT00023A99.

REINSURANCE METHOD

         Modified coinsurance for 15% of the full risks.
         YRT for an additional 35% of the longevity risk.
         (the above subject to agreement on the Risk Charge noted below)

REINSURANCE PREMIUM AND BENEFITS

         For the modified coinsurance portion, Annuity & Life Re ("ALRe") will
         receive/reimburse a 15% quota share of all flows under the agreement
         with Old Mutual. For the YRT portion, ALRe will receive a premium equal
         to the expected benefit payments based on XLMO's original pricing
         assumptions. ALRe will reimburse the actual benefits payments made.
         ALRe will receive a Risk Charge based on the amount of capital required
         to support the longevity risk. The Risk Charge is estimated to be 13
         basis points of statutory reserves annually, but is subject to
         agreement by both parties.
