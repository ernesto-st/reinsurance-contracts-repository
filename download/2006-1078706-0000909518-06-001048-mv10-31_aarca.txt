         owned by such Loan Party or a license granted to such Loan Party) the
         Collateral Agent would have rights under such trademark or license
         pursuant to the Security Agreement or other agreement satisfactory to
         the Administrative Agent to sell such Inventory in connection with a
         liquidation thereof and, in each case, that the Administrative Agent
         deems to be Eligible Inventory based on such credit and collateral
         considerations as the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion
         exercised reasonably, deem appropriate for this transaction. The value
         of such Inventory shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in

                           (vi) Inventory in respect of which the Security
                  Agreement, after giving effect to the related filings of
                  financing statements that have then been made, if any, does
                  not or has ceased to create a valid and perfected first
                  priority lien or security interest in favor of the Collateral
                  Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties securing the
                  Secured Obligations.

         Metals based on such credit and collateral considerations as the
         Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion exercised reasonably,
         deem appropriate for this transaction and for such assets. The value of
         such precious metals shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in
         its sole discretion taking into consideration any and all factors the

         Agent to consider any precious metals not to be Eligible Precious

         classes of precious metals not to be Eligible Precious Metals:

                           (i) precious metals located anywhere other than on

                  Security Agreement, after giving effect to the related filings
                  of financing statements that have then been made, if any, does
                  not or has ceased to create a valid and perfected first
                  priority lien or security interest in favor of the Collateral
                  Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties securing the
                  Secured Obligations.

         contained in any Loan Document are true and correct in all material
         respects, and (b) the Eligible Real Property Conditions have been
         satisfied with respect to such property, and, in each case, as to which
         the Administrative Agent deems to be Eligible Real Property based on
         such credit and collateral considerations as the Administrative Agent

         by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion taking into

                  division thereof, having regulatory authority over such real
                  property or its use or sale, regardless of whether such

                  Mortgage, after giving effect to all related filings and
                  recordations that have then been made, does not or has ceased
                  to create a valid first priority security interest in favor of
                  the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties
                  securing the Secured Obligations.

         Specified Deductions), and deemed appropriate for this transaction by
         the Administrative Agent using criteria customary for Receivables of a

exceed at any time the Issuing Bank's Letter of Credit Commitment at such time

expiration date (including all rights of the Borrower or the beneficiary to
require renewal) later than the date agreed to by the Issuing Bank and the
Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit and (A) in the case of a Standby
Letter of Credit, shall not have an expiration date later than one year after
the date of issuance thereof, but may by its terms be renewable annually upon
notice (a "NOTICE OF RENEWAL") given to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative
Agent on or prior to any date for notice of renewal set forth in such Letter of


                                       39
<PAGE>

the date for notice of termination set forth in such Letter of Credit but in any
event at least 30 Business Days prior to the date of automatic renewal of its
election not to renew such Standby Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF TERMINATION")
and (B) in the case of a Trade Letter of Credit, shall not have an expiration

give the beneficiary named in such Standby Letter of Credit notice of any Notice
of Termination, (y) permit such beneficiary, upon receipt of such notice, to
draw under such Standby Letter of Credit prior to the date such Standby Letter
of Credit otherwise would have been automatically renewed and (z) not permit the
expiration date (after giving effect to any renewal) of such Standby Letter of
Credit in any event to be extended to a date later than 60 days before the
Termination Date. If either a Notice of Renewal is not given by the Borrower or
a Notice of Termination is given by the Issuing Bank pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, such Standby Letter of Credit shall expire on the date on
which it otherwise would have been automatically renewed; provided, however,
that even in the absence of receipt of a Notice of Renewal the Issuing Bank may
in its discretion, unless instructed to the contrary by the Administrative Agent
or the Borrower, deem that a Notice of Renewal had been timely delivered and in
such case, a Notice of Renewal shall be deemed to have been so delivered for all
purposes under this Agreement. Within the limits of the Letter of Credit
Facility, and subject to the limits referred to above, the Borrower may request
the issuance of Letters of Credit under this Section 2.01(d), repay any Letter
of Credit Advances resulting from drawings thereunder pursuant to Section
2.03(c) and request the issuance of additional Letters of Credit under this

all Letters of Credit then outstanding which have an expiration date later than

of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar
Rate Advances, or the first Business Day prior to the date of the proposed

specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of
Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and
(iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial
Interest Period for each such Advance. Each Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New

its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing in accordance with the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of such


                                       40
<PAGE>
Lender and the other Lenders. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by
crediting the Borrower's Account; provided, however, that, in the case of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall first make a portion
of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Swing Line Advances
and Letter of Credit Advances made by the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, and by any other Lender and outstanding on the date of such
Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as
of such date, available to the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, and such other Lenders for repayment of such Swing Line Advances and
Letter of Credit Advances.

                  (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice, given
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Swing
Line Borrowing, by the Borrower to the Swing Line Bank and the Administrative
Agent. Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF SWING LINE
BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or by telex
or telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii)
amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing (which maturity
shall be no later than the seventh day after the requested date of such
Borrowing). The Swing Line Bank will make the amount of the requested Swing Line
Advances available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
Account, in same day funds. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by
crediting the Borrower's Account. Upon written demand by the Swing Line Bank,
with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each other Lender shall
purchase from the Swing Line Bank, and the Swing Line Bank shall sell and assign
to each such other Lender, such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
outstanding Swing Line Advance as of the date of such demand, by making
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank, by deposit to the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the
outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such
Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Lender
agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Swing Line Advance on
(i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the Swing Line Bank,
provided that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding
such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon any such
assignment by the Swing Line Bank to any other Lender of a portion of a Swing
Line Advance, the Swing Line Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender
that the Swing Line Bank is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest
being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes
no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or
any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the
amount of such Swing Line Advance available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the
Swing Line Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent,
at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent
such amount for the account of the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such
amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance
made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the


                                       41
<PAGE>
outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the Swing Line
Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

                  (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for
the initial Borrowing hereunder or for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of
such Borrowing is less than $5 million or if the obligation of the Lenders to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.09
or 2.10 and (ii) the Revolving Credit Advances may not be outstanding as part of
more than eight separate Borrowings.

                  (d) Each Notice of Borrowing and each Notice of Swing Line
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any
Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any
loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to
fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without
limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on
such date.

                  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until
the date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in
the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at such time under
Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such
Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such
Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for all purposes.

                  (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made
by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing,
but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make
the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters
of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon
notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the fourth
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of
Credit, by the Borrower to the Issuing Bank, which shall give to the


                                       42
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent and each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier or
electronic communication. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a
"NOTICE OF ISSUANCE") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing,
or telecopier electronic communication, specifying therein the requested (A)
date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) Available Amount of
such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (D) name
and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such
Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such application and agreement for
letter of credit as the Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower for use in
connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a "LETTER OF CREDIT
AGREEMENT"). If (x) the requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to
the Issuing Bank in its sole discretion exercised reasonably and (y) it has not
received notice of objection to such issuance from the Required Lenders, the
Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower at its office
referred to in Section 8.02 or as otherwise agreed with the Borrower in
connection with such issuance. In the event and to the extent that the
provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

                  (b) Letter of Credit Reports. The Issuing Bank shall furnish
(i) to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Lender on the first
Business Day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and expiration
dates of Letters of Credit issued during the preceding month and drawings during
such month under all Letters of Credit and, (ii) to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report
setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding
calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit.

                  (c) Participations in Letters of Credit. Upon the issuance of
a Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank under Section 2.03(a), the Issuing Bank
shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to
each Lender, and each such Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any
party hereto, to have purchased from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit in an amount for each Lender equal to such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, effective upon the
issuance of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and
not reimbursed by the Borrower forthwith on the date due as provided in Section
2.04(d) by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank by deposit to the
Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such L/C Disbursement. Each Lender acknowledges and
agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section
2.03(c) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall
not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the termination of the
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any off-set,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. If and to the extent that any
Lender shall not have so made the amount of such L/C Disbursement available to
the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such L/C Disbursement is due pursuant to Section 2.04(b) until the
date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate
for its account or the account of the Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such


                                       43
<PAGE>
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the
Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal
shall constitute a Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business
Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the
Letter of Credit Advance made by the Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such
amount on such Business Day.

                  (d) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by the Issuing Bank
of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of
this Agreement the making by the Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance,
which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft.

                  (e) Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The failure of
any Lender to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date
specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

         SECTION 2.04. Repayment of Advances. (a) Daily Repayments Upon Default.
On each Business Day after the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply all amounts on deposit in the Cash
Collateral Account first, to the prepayment of the L/C Advances then outstanding
until such Advances are paid in full, second to the prepayment of the Swing Line
Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full, third to the
prepayment of the Revolving Credit Advances until such Advances are paid in full
and fourth to be deposited in the L/C Collateral Account to cash collateralize
103% of the Available Amount of the Letters of Credit then outstanding.

                  (b) Revolving Credit Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination
Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances then
outstanding.

                  (c) Swing Line Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank and each other
Lender that has made a Swing Line Advance the outstanding principal amount of
each Swing Line Advance made by each of them on the earlier of the maturity date
specified in the applicable Notice of Swing Line Borrowing (which maturity shall
be no later than the seventh day after the requested date of such Borrowing) and
the Termination Date.

                  (d) Letter of Credit Advances. (i) The Borrower shall repay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank and each other
Lender that has made a Letter of Credit Advance on the earlier of demand
(accompanied by written notice from the Issuing Bank that a payment has been
made under such Letter of Credit) and the Termination Date the outstanding
principal amount of each Letter of Credit Advance made by each of them.

                  (ii) The Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, any
Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or instrument relating to any
Letter of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letter of Credit


                                       44
<PAGE>
Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances,
including, without limitation, the following circumstances (it being understood
that any such payment by the Borrower is without prejudice to, and does not
constitute a waiver of, any rights the Borrower might have or might acquire as a
result of the payment by the Issuing Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by
the Borrower thereof):

                  (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
         Document, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any
         other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing
         being, collectively, the "L/C RELATED DOCUMENTS");

                  (B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
         in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in
         respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment or waiver of
         or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C Related
         Documents;

                  (C) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or
         any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such
         beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or
         any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

                  (D) any statement or any other document presented under a
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (E) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft, certificate or other document that
         does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                  (F) any non-perfection of any Collateral or any release or
         amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Subsidiary
         Guaranty for all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in respect
         of the L/C Related Documents; or

                  (G) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing, including, without limitation, any
         other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available
         to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or a Subsidiary Guarantor.

         SECTION 2.05. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a)
Optional. The Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, and without premium or penalty, terminate in whole or
reduce in part the unused portions of the Letter of Credit Facility and/or the
Unused Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however, that each partial
reduction of a Facility (i) shall be in an aggregate amount of $5 million or an
integral multiple of $1 million in excess thereof and (ii) shall be made ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their Commitments with respect to such
Facility.

                  (b) Mandatory. (i) The Letter of Credit Facility shall be
permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the
Revolving Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the


                                       45
<PAGE>
Letter of Credit Facility exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving
effect to such reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility.

                  (ii) The Swing Line Facility shall be permanently reduced from
time to time on the date of each reduction in the Revolving Credit Facility by
the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Swing Line Facility exceeds the
Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction of the Revolving
Credit Facility.

         SECTION 2.06. Prepayments. (a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon at
least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate Advances and three
Business Days' notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to
the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay
the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Advances comprising part of
the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest
to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount so prepaid;
provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $5 million or an integral multiple of $1 million in excess
thereof and (y) if any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made on a date
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Advance, the Borrower
shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 8.04(d).

                  (b) Mandatory. (i) The Borrower shall, on the applicable
Prepayment Date with respect to Net Cash Proceeds by any Loan Party from (A) the
sale, lease, transfer or other disposition including, without limitation, any
and all involuntary dispositions, whether by condemnation, casualty loss or
otherwise, of any assets of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of assets referred to in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Certain Permitted Dispositions),
(B) the incurrence or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of
any Debt (other than Debt incurred or issued pursuant to Section 5.02(b)), (C)
the sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any Equity
Interests and (D) any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the
account of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries and not otherwise included
in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings (with application to be made in
accordance with clause (iv) of this Section 2.06(b)), in an aggregate amount
equal to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds. Each such prepayment shall be
applied to the Revolving Credit Facility as set forth in clause (iv) below. For
the avoidance of doubt, mandatory prepayments shall not permanently reduce the
Commitments.

                  (ii) The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, prepay an
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of
the same Borrowings, the Letter of Credit Advances and the Swing Line Advances
(with application to be made in accordance with clause (iv) of this Section
2.06(b)) in an amount equal to the amount by which (A) the sum of (I) the
aggregate principal amount of (x) the Revolving Credit Advances, (y) the Letter
of Credit Advances and (z) the Swing Line Advances then outstanding plus (II)
the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding,
exceeds (B) the lesser of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Loan Value on
such Business Day.

                                       46
<PAGE>
                  (iii) The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, pay to the
Administrative Agent for deposit in the L/C Collateral Account an amount
sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in the L/C Collateral
Account to equal the amount by which the aggregate Available Amount of all
Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility on such
Business Day.

                  (iv) Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made
pursuant to clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above shall be first applied to prepay
Letter of Credit Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full,
second applied to prepay Swing Line Advances then outstanding until such
Advances are paid in full, and third applied to prepay Revolving Credit Advances
then outstanding comprising part of the same Borrowings until such Advances are
paid in full; and, in the case of prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility
required pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, the amount remaining (if any)
after the prepayment in full of the Advances then outstanding (the sum of such
prepayment amounts in respect of Revolving Credit Advances, Letter of Credit
Advances and Swing Line Advances, and remaining amount being referred to herein
as the "REDUCTION AMOUNT") may be retained by the Borrower. Upon the drawing of
any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Collateral
Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or Lenders,
as applicable.

                  (v) All prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be made
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid, together with any amounts owing pursuant to Section 8.04. If any
payment of Eurodollar Rate Advances otherwise required to be made under this
Section 2.06(b) would be made on a day other than the last day of the applicable
Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may direct the Administrative Agent to
(and if so directed, the Administrative Agent shall) deposit such payment in the
Collateral Account until the last day of the applicable Interest Period at which
time the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such payment to the
prepayment of such Advances; provided, however, that such Advances shall
continue to bear interest as set forth in Section 2.07 until the last day of the
applicable Interest Period therefor.

         SECTION 2.07. Interest. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender
from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full,
at the following rates per annum:

                  (i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is
         a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base
         Rate in effect from time to time, payable in arrears monthly on the
         first day of each month during such periods and on the date such Base
         Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (ii) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such
         Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
         times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (A)
         the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus (B)
         the Applicable Margin, payable in arrears on the last day of such
         Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more
         than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period
         every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on
         the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in
         full.

                                       47
<PAGE>
                  (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and upon the
request of the Required Lenders shall, require that the Borrower pay interest
("DEFAULT Interest") on (i) the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of each
Advance owing to each Lender Party, payable in arrears on the dates referred to
in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 2.07(a), as applicable, or otherwise on demand,
at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum
required to be paid on such Advance pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of Section
2.07(a), as applicable, and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to any Agent or any Lender Party that is
not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount
shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid
in full or otherwise on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per
annum above the rate per annum required to be paid, in the case of interest, on
the Type of Advance on which such interest has accrued pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) of Section 2.07(a), as applicable, and, in all other cases, on Base Rate
Advances pursuant to clause (i) of Section 2.07(a); provided, however, that
following the acceleration of the Advances, or the giving of notice by the Agent
to accelerate the Advances that has not been revoked or rescinded, pursuant to
Section 6.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or
not previously required by the Administrative Agent.

                  (c) Notice of Interest Period and Interest Rate. Promptly
after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), a notice of
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest
Period pursuant to the terms of the definition of "Interest Period", the
Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and each Lender of the
applicable Interest Period and the applicable interest rate determined by the
Administrative Agent for purposes of clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above.

         SECTION 2.08. Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders a commitment fee, from the
date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date
specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender
in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date, payable in arrears
monthly on the first day of each month (or if such day is not a Business Day, on
the next succeeding Business Day), commencing on the first Business Day of the
first month commencing after the Effective Date, and on the Termination Date in
respect of the applicable Facility, at the rate per annum, on the sum of the
daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender plus its Pro Rata Share

initial period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the date which is
the last day of the Borrower's first full fiscal quarter following the Effective
Date, 0.30%, and (ii) as of any date thereafter, a rate per annum equal to the
rate set forth below opposite the then applicable Leverage Ratio (determined on
the last day for which financial statements and other information have been
delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(b) or (c)):

              Leverage Ratio:                          Rate:
              ---------------                          ----

              Equal to or less than 2.50 to 1.         0.250%

               than or equal to 4.25 to 1.             0.300%

              Greater than 4.25 to 1.                  0.375%


                                       48
<PAGE>
provided, however, that any commitment fee accrued with respect to any of the
Commitments of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such
Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable
by the Borrower so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to
the extent that such commitment fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by
the Borrower prior to such time; and provided further that no commitment fee
shall accrue on any of the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender so long as such
Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender.

                  Any change in the above commitment fee resulting from a change
in the Leverage Ratio on the last day of any subsequent fiscal quarter of the
Borrower shall become effective on the date of delivery by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent of financial statements and other information pursuant to
Section 5.03(b) or (c), as applicable, for the period ending on the last day of
such subsequent fiscal quarter, provided, however, that the rate of such
commitment fee shall be a rate of 0.375% per annum if the Borrower has failed to
furnish to the Administrative Agent such financial statements and other
information with respect to such fiscal quarter when required under Section
5.03(b) or (c), as applicable, in each case until such financial statements and
other information have been furnished.

                  (b) Letter of Credit Fees, Etc. (i) The Borrower shall pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commission, payable in
arrears monthly on the first day of each month (or if such day is not a Business

Termination Date in respect of the Letter of Credit Facility, on such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of the average daily aggregate stated amount during such month of
Letters of Credit outstanding from time to time at the rate of the Applicable
Margin for Eurodollar Rate Advances. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the amount of commission payable by the
Borrower under this clause (b)(i) shall be increased by 2% per annum.

                  (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Bank, for its
own account, (A) an issuance fee for each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to
0.25% per annum of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit on the date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit, payable in arrears monthly on the date of
issuance and on the corresponding day of the month (or if such day is not a
Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) of each of the immediately
succeeding months and (B) such other commissions, fronting fees, transfer fees
and other customary fees and charges in connection with the issuance or
administration of each Letter of Credit as the Borrower and the Issuing Bank
shall agree.

own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the Borrower
and such Agent.

         SECTION 2.09. Conversion of Advances. (a) Optional. The Borrower may on
any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of


                                       49
<PAGE>
the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Section 2.10, Convert
all or any portion of the Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing
into Advances of the other Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of
Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last
day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, any Conversion of
Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less
than the minimum amount specified in Section 2.02(c), no Conversion of any
Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section
2.02(c) and each Conversion of Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing
shall be made ratably among the Lenders. Each such notice of Conversion shall,
within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such
Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is
into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for
such Advances. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrower.

                  (b) Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $1 million, such
Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

                  (ii) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders,
whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day
of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance.

                  (iii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance and (y) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances
into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

         SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs, Etc. (a) If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve
Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or of making,
funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of
issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit (excluding, for
purposes of this Section 2.10, any such increased costs resulting from (x) Taxes
or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (y) changes in the
basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United
States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such
Lender Party is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by
such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost;
provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be responsible for costs under
this Section 2.10(a) arising more than 120 days prior to receipt by the Borrower
of the demand from the affected Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.10(a);


                                       50
<PAGE>
provided further that a Lender Party claiming additional amounts under this
Section 2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the
need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. A certificate as to the amount
of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party, shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in
or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with
any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender Party or
any corporation controlling such Lender Party as a result of or based upon the
existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue or participate
in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of such type or the
issuance or maintenance of or participation in the Letters of Credit (or similar
contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender Party or such
corporation (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender
Party, from time to time as specified by such Lender Party, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender Party in the light of such circumstances,
to the extent that such Lender Party reasonably determines such increase in
capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to
lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the
issuance or maintenance of or participation in any Letters of Credit; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not be responsible for costs under this Section
2.10(b) arising more than 180 days prior to receipt by the Borrower of the
demand from the affected Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.10(b). A
certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (c) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for
any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to
such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Rate Advances
for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make,
or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower that such Lenders have
determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental
Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder,
then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower
through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the


                                       51
<PAGE>
obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that, before making any such
demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations
to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (e) In the event that any Lender Party demands payment of
costs or additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.10 or Section 2.12 or asserts,
pursuant to Section 2.10(d), that it is unlawful for such Lender Party to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or becomes a Defaulting Lender then (subject to such
Lender Party's right to rescind such demand or assertion within 10 days after
the notice from the Borrower referred to below) the Borrower may, upon 20 days'
prior written notice to such Lender Party and the Administrative Agent, elect to
cause such Lender Party to assign its Advances and Commitments in full to one or
more Persons selected by the Borrower so long as (a) each such Person satisfies
the criteria of an Eligible Assignee and is reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, (b) such Lender Party receives payment in full in cash of
the outstanding principal amount of all Advances made by it and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts due and payable to such Lender
Party as of the date of such assignment (including, without limitation, amounts
owing pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.12, 2.15 and 8.04) and (c) each such Lender
Party assignee agrees to accept such assignment and to assume all obligations of
such Lender Party assignor hereunder in accordance with Section 8.07.

         SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make
each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of
counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15), not
later than 12:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account in same day
funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time
being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The
Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed
(i) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of principal, interest,
commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and under the
Notes to more than one Lender Party, to such Lender Parties for the account of
their respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the
amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to such Lender Parties and
(ii) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then
payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such Lender Party for the account of
its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and
recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under
the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender Party
assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall
make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.


                                       52
<PAGE>
                  (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party and each
of its Affiliates, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not
made when due hereunder or, in the case of a Lender, under the Note held by such
Lender, to charge from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party or such
Affiliate any amount so due.

                  (c) All computations of interest, fees and Letter of Credit
commissions shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of
360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day
but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest,
fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment or
letter of credit fee or commission, as the case may be; provided, however, that,
if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar
Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. All repayments of Advances
shall be applied first to repay such Advances that are Base Rate Advances and
then to repay such Advances that are Eurodollar Rate Advances.

                  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender
Party hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If
and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to
the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay
in full all amounts due and payable to the Agents and the Lender Parties under
or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such
payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the
Agents and the Lender Parties in the following order of priority:

                  (i) first, to the payment of all of the fees, indemnification
         payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Agents
         (solely in their respective capacities as Agents) under or in respect
         of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such date, ratably
         based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such fees,
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Agents on
         such date;

                                       53
<PAGE>
                  (ii) second, to the payment of all of the fees,
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable
         to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank (solely in their respective
         capacities as such) under or in respect of this Agreement and the other
         Loan Documents on such date, ratably based upon the respective
         aggregate amounts of all such fees, indemnification payments, costs and
         expenses owing to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank on such
         date;

                  (iii) third, to the payment of all of the indemnification
         payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Lenders
         under Sections 8.04 hereof, Section 10 of the Security Agreement and
         any similar section of any of the other Loan Documents on such date,
         ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Lenders on
         such date;

                  (iv) fourth, to the payment of all of the amounts that are due
         and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under
         Sections 2.10 and 2.12 hereof on such date, ratably based upon the
         respective aggregate amounts thereof owing to the Administrative Agent
         and the Lender Parties on such date;

                  (v) fifth, to the payment of all of the fees that are due and
         payable to the Lenders under Section 2.08(a) on such date, ratably

                  (vi) sixth, to the payment of all of the accrued and unpaid
         interest on the Obligations of the Borrower under or in respect of the
         Loan Documents that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent and
         the Lender Parties under Section 2.07(b) on such date, ratably based
         upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such interest owing to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;

                  (vii) seventh, to the payment of all of the accrued and unpaid
         interest on the Advances that is due and payable to the Administrative
         Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.07(a) on such date,
         ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
         interest owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on
         such date;

                  (viii) eighth, to the payment of the principal amount of all
         of the outstanding Advances that is due and payable to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date, ratably based
         upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such principal owing to
         the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;

                  (ix) ninth, to the payment of any and all ACH Obligations (as
         defined in the Security Agreement) owing to Citibank, N.A., any Lender
         or any of their respective Affiliates; and

                  (x) tenth, to the payment of all other Obligations of the Loan
         Parties owing under or in respect of the Loan Documents that are due

         on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of
         all such Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the other
         Secured Parties on such date.

         SECTION 2.12. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by any Loan Party to or
for the account of any Lender Party or any Agent hereunder or under the Notes or
any other Loan Document shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11 or the
applicable provisions of such other Loan Document, if any, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of each Lender Party and each Agent, taxes that are
imposed on its overall net income by the United States and taxes that are
imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof)
by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party
or such Agent, as the case may be, is organized or any political subdivision
thereof and, in the case of each Lender Party, taxes that are imposed on its
overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or
foreign jurisdiction of such Lender Party's Applicable Lending Office or any
political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments
hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If any
Loan Party shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable hereunder or under any Note or any other Loan Document to any
Lender Party or any Agent, (i) the sum payable by the Borrower shall be
increased as may be necessary so that after such Loan Party and the
Administrative Agent have made all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Lender Party
or such Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make
all such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, a Loan Party shall pay any present or future
stamp, documentary, excise, property, intangible, mortgage recording or similar
taxes, charges or levies that arise from any payment made by such Loan Party
hereunder or under any Notes or any other Loan Documents or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to
as "OTHER TAXES").

                  (c) The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender Party and
each Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other
Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12, imposed on or paid by
such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) makes written
demand setting forth in reasonable detail its claim and the basis for
indemnification hereunder.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the
appropriate Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address
referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing such payment, to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or
other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes or
the other Loan Documents by or on behalf of a Loan Party through an account or
branch outside the United States or by a payor that is not a United States
person, if such Loan Party determines that no Taxes are payable in respect


                                       55
<PAGE>
thereof, such Loan Party shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to
the Administrative Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to
the Administrative Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.

                  (e) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its
execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender
Party and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to
time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so
long thereafter as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), provide
each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal
Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or in the case of a Lender Party that
has certified in writing to the Administrative Agent that it is not (i) a "bank"
(as defined in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code), (ii) a
10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the
Internal Revenue Code) of the Borrower or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation
related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Internal
Revenue Code), Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN), as appropriate, or any
successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying
that such Lender Party is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United
States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes or
any other Loan Document or, in the case of a Lender Party that has certified
that it is not a "bank" as described above, certifying that such Lender Party is
a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust entitled to exemption from
withholding as portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code. If the forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender
Party first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest
withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be
considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party provides the
appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods
governed by such forms; provided, however, that if, at the effective date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to
this Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under
subsection (a) of this Section 2.12 in respect of United States withholding tax
with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes
shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the
future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding
tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date.
If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the
disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax
payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8EC1 or the related certificate described above, that the
applicable Lender Party reasonably considers to be confidential, such Lender
Party shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to
include in such form or document such confidential information. For purposes of
subsections (d) and (e) of this Section 2.12, the terms "UNITED STATES" and
"UNITED STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

                  (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has
failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other
document described in subsection (e) above (other than if such failure is due to
a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring
after the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was


                                       56
<PAGE>
required to be provided or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise
is not required under subsection (e) above), such Lender Party shall not be
entitled to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) of this Section 2.12
with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure;
provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of
its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder,
the Loan Parties shall take such steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably
request to assist such Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

                  (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.12
shall survive the payment in full of the principal and of interest on all
Borrowings and Advances made hereunder.

                  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.12, any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 2.12 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that would be payable
or may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such
Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

                  (i) If the Borrower determines in good faith that substantial
authority exists for successfully contesting any Taxes paid or otherwise
indemnified against under Section 2.12(c), and so long as the Borrower agrees in
writing to indemnify the relevant Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other
Agent against any damages or costs in connection with such contest, the relevant
Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Agent, as applicable, shall
cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Taxes at the Borrower's expense,
if so requested by the Borrower, unless the relevant Lender, the Administrative
Agent or other Agent, as the case may be, determines in its discretion that it
would be adversely affected by such contest. If any Lender, the Administrative
Agent or any other Agent, as applicable, receives a refund of a Tax previously
paid by the Borrower or otherwise indemnified against under Section 2.12(c),
which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender, the Administrative Agent
or such other Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by
the Borrower, then the Lender, the Administrative Agent or other Agent, as the
case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount (together with any
interest received thereon) as the Lender, the Administrative Agent or other
Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the refund as will
leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into
account expenses or any Taxes imposed on the refund) than it would have been in
if the payment had not been required, provided, however, that any such
reimbursement shall be made only after such refund has been finally determined
and cannot be adjusted and the Borrower shall return such refund to such Lender
or Agent if erroneously made or otherwise changed. At the expense of the
Borrower, the Lender, an Administrative Agent or other Agent shall claim any
refund involving a Tax against which it is indemnified by the Borrower that such
Lender or Agent determines is available to it, unless such Lender or Agent
concludes in its discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a
claim. The agreements in this clause (i) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.


                                       57

         SECTION 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party shall
obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an
assignment pursuant to Section 8.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender
Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and
payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and
payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time
obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account of Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder and under the
Notes and the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such
Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing
(but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes
and the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the
Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and
under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the Lender Parties at such time,
such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender Parties such
interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing
to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each other
Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Lender Party shall repay to the
purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such Lender Party's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to
such Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lender
Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender Party's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other
Lender Party's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The
Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing an interest or participating
interest from another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or participating interest,
as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of
the Borrower in the amount of such interest or participating interest, as the
case may be.

         SECTION 2.14. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances and
issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that
it shall use such proceeds and Letters of Credit) solely to (i) refinance the
obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement, (ii) pay related transactions
costs, fees and expenses, and (iii) provide financing for working capital, and
other general corporate purposes for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "INTENDED USE TRANSACTIONS").

         SECTION 2.15. Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event that, at any one
time, (i) any Lender Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting
Lender shall owe a Defaulted Advance to the Borrower and (iii) the Borrower
shall be required to make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document
to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, so long
as no Default shall occur or be continuing at such time and to the fullest


                                       58
<PAGE>
extent permitted by applicable law, set off and otherwise apply the Obligation
of the Borrower to make such payment to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted
Advance. In the event that, on any date, the Borrower shall so set off and
otherwise apply its obligation to make any such payment against the obligation
of such Defaulting Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such
date, the amount so set off and otherwise applied by the Borrower shall
constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents an
Advance by such Defaulting Lender made on the date of such setoff under the
Facility pursuant to which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to
have been made pursuant to Section 2.01. Such Advance shall be considered, for
all purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the Borrowing in connection
with which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made
pursuant to Section 2.01, even if the other Advances comprising such Borrowing
shall be Eurodollar Rate Advances on the date such Advance is deemed to be made
pursuant to this subsection (a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent at any time the Borrower exercises its right of set-off pursuant to this
subsection (a) and shall set forth in such notice (A) the name of the Defaulting
Lender and the Defaulted Advance required to be made by such Defaulting Lender
and (B) the amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of such Defaulted
Advance pursuant to this subsection (a). Any portion of such payment otherwise
required to be made by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender which is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the amount set off
and otherwise applied by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) or (c) of
this Section 2.15.

                  (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party
shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted
Amount to any Agent or any of the other Lender Parties and (iii) the Borrower
shall make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the
Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such other Agents or
such other Lender Parties and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply at such time the amount so paid by the Borrower to or for the account of
such Defaulting Lender to the payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the
extent required to pay such Defaulted Amount. In the event that the
Administrative Agent shall so apply any such amount to the payment of any such
Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied by the Administrative Agent
shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
payment, to such extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount
so applied by the Administrative Agent shall be retained by the Administrative
Agent or distributed by the Administrative Agent to such other Agents or such
other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with the respective portions of such
Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the Administrative Agent, such other
Agents and such other Lender Parties and, if the amount of such payment made by
the Borrower shall at such time be insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts
owing at such time to the Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other
Lender Parties, in the following order of priority:

                  (i) first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then owing
         to them, in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with such
         respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Agents;


                                       59
<PAGE>
                  (ii) second, to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank for
         any Defaulted Amounts then owing to them, respectively in their
         capacities as such, ratably in accordance with such respective
         Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line
         Bank; and

                  (iii) third, to any other Lender Parties for any Defaulted
         Amounts then owing to such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance
         with such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lender
         Parties.

Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of this Section 2.15.

                  (c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party
shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a
Defaulted Advance or a Defaulted Amount and (iii) the Borrower, any Agent or any
other Lender Party shall be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder
or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender, then the Borrower or such Agent or such other Lender Party shall pay
such amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in escrow or the
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection (c) shall be deposited by
the Administrative Agent in an account with a bank (the "ESCROW BANK") selected
by the Administrative Agent, in the name and under the control of the
Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this subsection (c). The
terms applicable to such account, including the rate of interest payable with
respect to the credit balance of such account from time to time, shall be the
Escrow Bank's standard terms applicable to escrow accounts maintained with it.
Any interest credited to such account from time to time shall be held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by the Administrative Agent
from time to time in accordance with the provisions of, this subsection (c). The
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time to the extent necessary to
make any Advances required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and to pay any
amount payable by such Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party, as and when
such Advances or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the amount so
held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all such
Advances and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, in the following
order of priority:

                  (i) first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable
         by such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder, in their capacities as
         such, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and
         payable to the Agents;

                  (ii) second, to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank for
         any amounts then due and payable to them hereunder, in their capacities
         as such, by such Defaulting Lender, ratably in accordance with such
         respective amounts then due and payable to the Issuing Bank and the
         Swing Line Bank;

                                       60
<PAGE>
                  (iii) third, to any other Lender Parties for any amount then
         due and payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lender Parties
         hereunder, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due
         and payable to such other Lender Parties; and

                  (iv) fourth, to the Borrower for any Advance then required to
         be made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment of such
         Defaulting Lender.

In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any
time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender Party shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party and applied by such
Lender Party to the Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in accordance with the
respective amounts of such Obligations outstanding at such time.

                  (d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under
this Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower
may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Advance
and that any Agent or any Lender Party may have against such Defaulting Lender
with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

         SECTION 2.16. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender Party shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to
such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The
Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender Party to the Borrower (with a
copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory
note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for
such Lender Party to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or
otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender Party, the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender Party, with a copy to
the Administrative Agent, a Note, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto,
payable to the order of such Lender Party in a principal amount equal to the
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender Party. All references to Notes in the
Loan Documents shall mean Notes, if any, to the extent issued hereunder.

                  (b) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 8.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary
account for each Lender Party, in which accounts (taken together) shall be
recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of
Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender Party
hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender Party's share thereof.

                  (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in
the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender Party in its
account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie
evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become
due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender


                                       61
<PAGE>
Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender Party, under
this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party to make an entry, or any finding
that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall
not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement.

         SECTION 2.17. Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments

                  (a) Incremental Commitments. Provided there exists no Default
or Event of Default, the Borrower may from time to time, in accordance with this
Section 2.17, elect to increase the Revolving Credit Commitments by a written
notice to the Administrative Agent (each, an "INCREMENTAL REVOLVING CREDIT
COMMITMENT NOTICE"), which Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment Notice shall
be promptly notified by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, by an amount
(for all such Revolving Credit Commitment increases) not exceeding $200 million
(each such increase, an "INCREMENTAL REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT") ; provided
that any such increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25 million. Such
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment Notice shall specify the time period (to
be determined by the Borrower upon consultation with the Administrative Agent,
but in no event to be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of
such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment Notice to the Administrative Agent)
within which each Lender is required to inform the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent whether such Lender desires to participate in such
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment.

                  (b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent within the prescribed time period whether
or not it desires (in its sole discretion) to participate in such Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitment and increase its Revolving Credit Commitment in
connection therewith and, if so, shall specify the amount of the additional
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment
requested to be allocated to it. Any Lender not responding within such time
period shall be deemed to have declined to participate in such Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitment.

                  (c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the
Lenders' responses to each Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment Notice. To
obtain commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the Incremental Revolving
Credit Commitment subject to each Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment
Notice, and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing
Bank (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the
Borrower may obtain the commitments of additional Eligible Assignees to become
Lenders under this Agreement pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Revolving Credit
Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "REVOLVING CREDIT
INCREASE EFFECTIVE DATE") and the final allocation of the applicable Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the
Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date.

<PAGE>
                  (e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition
precedent to each Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of
the Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of
such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such
Loan Party approving or consenting to such Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitment, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, before and
after giving effect to such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, (A) the
representations and warranties contained in Article IV and the other Loan
Documents are true and correct on and as of the relevant Revolving Credit
Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true
and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.17, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (i) of
Section 4.01(g) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished
pursuant to clause (b) of Section 5.03, (B) no Default or Event of Default
exists or would exist after giving effect to such Incremental Revolving Credit
Commitment and the application of any proceeds thereof, and (C) all accrued fees
and expenses of the Agents and the Lender Parties participating in such
Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment in connection with such Incremental
Revolving Credit Commitment (including, without limitation, the reasonable
accrued fees and expenses of counsel to the Administrative Agent as set forth in
an invoice to be provided to the Borrower from the Administrative Agent) have
been paid. The Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on
the Revolving Credit Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts
required pursuant to Section 2.10) to the extent necessary to keep the
outstanding Revolving Credit Advances ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares
in respect of Revolving Credit Commitments arising from any nonratable increase
in the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section.

                  (f) Any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment (i) shall rank
pari passu in right of payment and of security with, and shall have the same
guarantees as, the Senior Facility, (ii) shall not mature earlier than the
Termination Date and shall have a life to maturity that is no shorter than the
life to maturity of the Senior Facility, (iii) shall be treated substantially
the same as the Senior Facility (including with respect to mandatory and
voluntary prepayments) and all other terms and documentation in respect thereof,
to the extent inconsistent with the Senior Facility, shall not be more onerous
than the Senior Facility and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, and (iii) in the event the applicable margin on an Advance
pursuant to any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment at any time exceeds the
Applicable Margin hereunder, the Applicable Margin hereunder shall be
automatically increased so that no such excess exists.

                                   ARTICLE III

                            CONDITIONS OF LENDING AND

                  Collateral Agent, the Collateral Monitoring Agent and the
                  Administrative Agent, provided, however, that to the extent
                  that any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
                  otherwise received any of the foregoing items with respect to
                  such real property, such items shall, promptly after the

                  directly or indirectly by a CFC) to take, all such other
                  action as the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Monitoring

                  (k) Further Assurances. (i) Promptly upon request by the
         Administrative Agent, correct, and cause each of its Subsidiaries
         promptly to correct, any material defect or error that may be
         discovered in any Loan Document or in the execution, acknowledgment,
         filing or recordation thereof, and

                  (ii) Promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent, do,
         execute, acknowledge, deliver, record, re-record, file, re-file,
         register and re-register any and all such further acts, deeds,

         assignments, financing statements and continuations thereof,
         termination statements, notices of assignment, transfers, certificates,
         assurances and other instruments as the Administrative Agent may
         reasonably require from time to time in order to (A) carry out more
         effectively the purposes of the Loan Documents, (B) to the fullest
         extent permitted by applicable law, subject any Loan Party's or any of
         its Subsidiaries' properties, assets, rights or interests to the Liens
         now or hereafter intended to be created by any of the Collateral
         Documents, (C) perfect and maintain the validity, effectiveness and
         priority of any of the Collateral Documents and any of the Liens
         intended to be created thereunder and (D) assure, convey, grant,

         the Secured Parties the rights granted or now or hereafter intended to
         be granted to the Secured Parties under any Loan Document or under any
         other instrument executed in connection with any Loan Document to which
         any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries is or is to be a party, and
         cause each of its Subsidiaries to do so.

                  (l) Performance of Tax Agreement. Perform and observe, and
         cause each of its Subsidiaries to perform and observe, all of the terms
         and provisions of the Tax Agreement to be performed or observed by it,
         maintain the Tax Agreement in full force and effect, enforce the Tax
         Agreement in accordance with its terms, and take all such action under
         the Tax Agreement to such end as may be from time to time reasonably
         requested by the Administrative Agent.

                  (m) Preparation of Environmental Reports. At the reasonable
         request of the Administrative Agent from time to time (not to exceed
         once per year for each such property, except during the continuance of
         any Default), provide to the Administrative Agent within 60 days after
         such request or such later date as may be agreed to by the
         Administrative Agent, at the expense of the Borrower, an environmental
         site assessment report for any of its or its Subsidiaries' properties
         described in such request, prepared by an environmental consulting firm
         acceptable to the Administrative Agent, indicating the presence or
         absence of Hazardous Materials and the estimated cost of any
         compliance, removal or remedial action in connection with any Hazardous
         Materials on such properties, if any.

                  (n) Compliance with Terms of Leaseholds. Make all payments and
         otherwise perform all obligations in respect of all leases of real
         property to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,

<PAGE>
         keep such leases in full force and effect and not allow such leases to
         lapse or be terminated or any rights to renew such leases to be
         forfeited or cancelled, notify the Administrative Agent of any material
         default of which it is aware by any party with respect to such leases
         and cooperate with the Administrative Agent in all respects to cure any
         such default by a Loan Party, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to do
         so, except, in any case, where the failure to do so, either
         individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably likely to
         have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (o) Cash Concentration Accounts. (i) Maintain the Cash
         Collateral Account with Citibank, N.A. in accordance with the terms of
         the Security Agreement, and from which accounts funds may only be
         withdrawn with the consent of the Administrative Agent, provided,
         however, that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing, the Administrative Agent hereby consents and shall be
         deemed to have granted such consent to the extent that (after giving
         effect to any withdrawals) the aggregate amount of (x) excess
         availability under the Facility, plus (y) the aggregate amount of cash
         and Cash Equivalents held by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the
         Cash Collateral Account equals or exceeds $35 million in the aggregate;
         (ii) maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain, lockbox
         accounts into which all proceeds of Collateral are paid with one or
         more depository banks acceptable to the Administrative Agent that have
         (subject to the provisions of the Collateral Documents) accepted the
         assignment of such accounts to the Collateral Agent (or its agent
         designated for such purpose) for the benefit of the Secured Parties
         pursuant to the Security Agreement; and (iii) cause all amounts on
         deposit in any deposit account to be transferred to the Cash Collateral
         Account at the end of each Business Day, except with respect to deposit
         accounts that the Borrower has (actual or deemed) approval from the
         Administrative Agent to fund from the Cash Collateral Account pursuant
         to Section 3.4(d)(v) of the Security Agreement.

                  (p) Performance of Material Contracts. Perform and observe all
         the terms and provisions of each Material Contract to be performed or
         observed by it, maintain each such Material Contract in full force and
         effect, enforce each such Material Contract in accordance with its
         terms, take all such action to such end as may be from time to time
         requested by the Administrative Agent, and cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to do so, except, in any case, where the failure to do so,
         either individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably likely
         to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (q) G-I Holdings. Upon the Administrative Agent's reasonable
         request, but not more frequently than once per month, make a senior
         officer of the Borrower available to provide to the Administrative
         Agent (i) an update of developments in (A) the G-I Holdings bankruptcy
         proceedings, and (B) any proceedings related to asserted Federal income
         tax liabilities in connection with the Rhone Poulenc Transactions and
         (ii) any information relating thereto that the Administrative Agent may
         reasonably request.

                  (r) Reportable Transaction. The Borrower will notify the
         Administrative Agent promptly in the event that the Borrower or any
         other member of the G-I Holdings Tax Group specifically identifies any
         of the Borrowings or Advances under this Agreement as a "reportable
         transaction" on Internal Revenue Service Form 8886 filed with the U.S.


                                       80

                  (s) Tax Liabilities. The Borrower (i) shall immediately inform
         the Lenders with respect to the Rhone Poulenc Transactions of (A) any
         written settlement proposal by any member of the G-I Holdings Tax Group

         could require any Loan Party to incur liability or otherwise satisfy
         such settlement in whole or in part; (B) any court ruling determining
         tax liability or otherwise addressing the merits of the case; (C) any
         proposed or actual assessment or deficiency as to which any Loan Party
         or any member of the G-I Holdings Tax Group has knowledge; or (D) any
         written demand for payment of taxes from a tax authority, and (ii)
         shall provide any information available to them and reasonably required
         by the Lenders to make the determination in Section 6.01(h)(i).

                  (t) Mortgage Amendments. Within 90 days after the Effective
         Date (which time period may be extended in the sole discretion of the
         Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, and shall cause each
         relevant Subsidiary to, as the case may be, furnish to the
         Administrative Agent:

                  AMENDMENTS") with respect to the mortgages covering the
                  Previously Mortgaged Properties (each such mortgage, an
                  "EXISTING MORTGAGE") have been duly executed, acknowledged and
                  delivered by a duly authorized officer of each party thereto
                  on or before such date and are in form suitable for filing and
                  recording in all filing or recording offices that the
                  Administrative Agent may reasonably deem necessary;

                           (ii) Title searches by a title insurer reasonably
                  acceptable to the Administrative Agent with respect to the
                  property encumbered by the Existing Mortgages showing (x) no
                  Liens of record other than those created by or permitted under
                  the terms of the applicable Existing Mortgage and (y) that
                  title to the applicable property remains vested in the
                  appropriate Loan Party;

                           (iii) Flood hazard determinations with respect to
                  each of the Previously Mortgaged Properties to determine

                  located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency
                  Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards;

                           (iv) Such advice, as may be reasonably required by
                  the Administrative Agent, from local counsel in any
                  jurisdiction that may assess documentary stamp, mortgage,
                  intangible or other similar taxes on any Mortgage Amendment,
                  which local counsel shall be retained by the Borrower;

                           (v) Such other consents, agreements and confirmations
                  of lessors and third parties as the Administrative Agent may
                  reasonably deem necessary to effectuate the Mortgage
                  Amendments; and

                                       81

                  the other matters described in this Section 5.01(t) and as
                  otherwise required to be paid in connection therewith under
                  Section 8.04 hereof.


         SECTION 5.02. Negative Covenants. So long as any Advance or any other
Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any
Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or any Lender Party shall have any
Commitment hereunder, the Borrower will not, at any time:

                  (a) Liens, Etc. Create, incur, assume or suffer to exist, or
         permit any of its Subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to

         character (including, without limitation, accounts) whether now owned
         or hereafter acquired, or sign or file or suffer to exist, or permit
         any of its Subsidiaries to sign or file or suffer to exist, under the
         Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction, a financing statement that
         names the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as debtor, or sign or
         suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to sign or suffer to
         exist, any security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder
         to file such financing statement, or assign, or permit any of its
         Subsidiaries to assign, any accounts or other right to receive income,
         except:

                           (iv) purchase money Liens upon or in real property or
                  equipment acquired or held by the Borrower or any of its
                  Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business to secure the
                  purchase price of such property or equipment or to secure Debt
                  incurred solely for the purpose of financing the acquisition,
                  construction or improvement of any such property or equipment
                  to be subject to such Liens, or Liens existing on any such
                  property or equipment at the time of acquisition (other than
                  any such Liens created in contemplation of such acquisition
                  that do not secure the purchase price), or extensions,
                  renewals or replacements of any of the foregoing for the same
                  or a lesser amount, in each case, to the extent permitted
                  under Section 5.02(b)(iii)(B)(I); provided, however, that no
                  such Lien shall extend to or cover any property other than the
                  property or equipment being acquired, constructed or improved,
                  and no such extension, renewal or replacement shall extend to
                  or cover any property not theretofore subject to the Lien
                  being extended, renewed or replaced; and provided further that
                  the aggregate principal amount of the Debt secured by Liens
                  permitted by this clause (iv) shall not exceed the amount


                                       82

                           (v) Liens arising in connection with Capitalized
                  Leases permitted under Section 5.02(b)(iii)(B)(II); provided
                  that no such Lien shall extend to or cover any Collateral or

                  Leases; and provided, further that the aggregate principal
                  amount of the Debt secured by Liens permitted by this clause
                  (v) shall not exceed the amount permitted with respect thereto

         shall fail to pay any interest on any Advance, or any Loan Party shall

         any of its officers) under or in connection with any Loan Document
         shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made;
         or

                  (c) the Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any term,
         covenant or agreement contained in Section 2.14, 5.01(e), (f), (i) or

         term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document on its part
         to be performed or observed if such failure shall remain unremedied for
         15 days after the earlier of the date on which (i) a Responsible
         Officer becomes aware of such failure or (ii) written notice thereof
         shall have been given to the Borrower by any Agent or any Lender Party;
         or

                  (e) any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to
         pay any principal of, premium or interest on or any other amount
         payable in respect of any Debt of such Loan Party or such Subsidiary
         (as the case may be) that is outstanding in a principal amount of at
         least $25 million either individually or in the aggregate for all such
         Loan Parties and Subsidiaries (but excluding Debt outstanding
         hereunder), when the same becomes due and payable (whether by scheduled
         maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise), and
         such failure shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any,
         specified in the agreement or instrument relating to such Debt; or any
         other event shall occur or condition shall exist under any agreement or
         instrument relating to any such Debt and shall continue after the
         applicable grace period, if any, specified in such agreement or
         instrument, if the effect of such event or condition is to accelerate,
         or to permit the acceleration of, the maturity of such Debt or
         otherwise to cause, or to permit the holder thereof to cause, such Debt
         to mature; or any such Debt shall be declared to be due and payable or
         required to be prepaid or redeemed (other than by a regularly scheduled
         required prepayment or redemption), purchased or defeased, or an offer
         to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease such Debt shall be required to
         be made, in each case prior to the stated maturity thereof; or

                  (f) any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall generally
         not pay its debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in writing
         its inability to pay its debts generally, or shall make a general
         assignment for the benefit of creditors; or any proceeding shall be
         instituted by or against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
         seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking
         liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
         protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any law
         relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of
         debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment
         of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or for any
         substantial part of its property and, in the case of any such
         proceeding instituted against it (but not instituted by it) that is
         being diligently contested by it in good faith, either such proceeding
         shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 days or any of
         the actions sought in such proceeding (including, without limitation,
         the entry of an order for relief against, or the appointment of a


                                       99
<PAGE>
         receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for, it or any
         substantial part of its property) shall occur; or any Loan Party or any
         of its Subsidiaries shall take any corporate action to authorize any of
         the actions set forth above in this subsection (f); or

                  (g) any judgments or orders (other than in respect of the
         alleged Federal income tax liabilities of the Borrower relating to or
         arising out of the Rhone Poulenc Transactions or relating to the
         alleged asbestos liabilities of the Borrower), either individually or
         in the aggregate, for the payment of money in excess of $25 million
         shall be rendered against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries and
         either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any
         creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) there shall be any period
         of 15 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such
         judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall
         not be in effect; provided, however, that any such judgment or order
         shall not give rise to an Event of Default under this Section 6.01(g)
         if and for so long as (A) the amount of such judgment or order is
         covered by a valid and binding policy of insurance between the
         defendant and the insurer, which shall be rated at least "A" by A.M.
         Best Company, covering full payment thereof and (B) such insurer has
         been notified, and has not disputed the claim made for payment, of the
         amount of such judgment or order; or

                  (h) after the date hereof (i) any court or governmental agency
         determines a tax liability or otherwise issues any adverse ruling
         addressing the merits, proposes to or actually enters a stipulated
         settlement or settlement notice, or makes or provides any assessment,
         notice of intent to file a lien, or lien filing against any member of
         the G-I Holdings Tax Group or any Loan Party with respect to the Rhone
         Poulenc Transactions, and there shall be a period of 20 consecutive
         days after the taking of such action during which time the Super
         Majority Lenders shall not have determined that there shall not exist,
         because of such action, a reasonable likelihood that one or more of the
         Loan Parties will pay, satisfy, or receive demand for payment of any
         tax liabilities relating to or arising out of the Rhone Poulenc
         Transactions (it being understood that during such 20 consecutive day
         period the Lender Parties shall not be required to make any Advances
         hereunder), or (ii) any court renders a judgment or order against any
         Loan Party related to or arising out of the alleged asbestos
         liabilities of the Borrower and as a result of which it is reasonable
         to conclude that the Loan Parties might be liable for such asbestos
         liabilities (it being understood and agreed that any adverse ruling by
         the court in the DJ Action shall not, solely by itself, constitute an
         Event of Default under this clause 6.01(h)(ii)); or

                  (i) any non-monetary judgment or order shall be rendered
         against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries that could be
         reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and there shall be
         any period of 20 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of
         such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise,
         shall not be in effect; or

                  (j) any provision of any Loan Document after delivery thereof
         pursuant to Section 3.01 or 5.01(j) shall for any reason cease to be
         valid and binding on or enforceable against any Loan Party party to it,
         or any such Loan Party shall so state in writing; or


                                      100
<PAGE>
                  (k) any Collateral Document or financing statement after
         delivery thereof pursuant to Section 3.01 or 5.01(j) shall for any
         reason (other than pursuant to or permitted by the terms of any Loan
         Document) cease to create a valid and perfected first priority lien
         subject to any Liens permitted by Section 5.02 on and security interest
         in the Collateral purported to be covered thereby; or

                  (l) a Change of Control shall occur; or

                  (m) any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect to a Plan
         and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of such ERISA
         Event) of the Insufficiency of such Plan and the Insufficiency of any
         and all other Plans with respect to which an ERISA Event shall have
         occurred and then exist (or the liability of the Loan Parties and the
         ERISA Affiliates related to such ERISA Event) exceeds (together with
         all other liabilities described in Section 6.01(m), (n), and (o)) $10
         million in the aggregate; or

                  (n) any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that it has incurred
         Withdrawal Liability to such Multiemployer Plan in an amount that, when
         aggregated with all other amounts required to be paid to Multiemployer
         Plans by the Loan Parties and the ERISA Affiliates as Withdrawal
         Liability (determined as of the date of such notification), exceeds
         (together with all other liabilities described in Section 6.01(m), (n),
         and (o)) $10 million in the aggregate; or

                  (o) any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate shall have been
         notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
         Plan is in reorganization or is being terminated, within the meaning of
         Title IV of ERISA, and as a result of such reorganization or
         termination the aggregate annual contributions of the Loan Parties and
         the ERISA Affiliates to all Multiemployer Plans that are then in
         reorganization or being terminated have been or will be increased over
         the amounts contributed to such Multiemployer Plans for the plan years
         of such Multiemployer Plans immediately preceding the plan year in
         which such reorganization or termination occurs by an amount exceeding
         (together with all other liabilities described in Section 6.01(m), (n),
         and (o)) $10 million in the aggregate; or

                  (p) any Federal tax Liens in respect of the proposed Federal
         income tax liabilities of the Borrower or any other member of the G-I
         Holdings Tax Group relating to or arising out of the Rhone Poulenc
         Transactions shall be created and be enforceable against the assets of
         any Loan Party; or

                  (q) there shall occur any Material Adverse Change; or

                  (r) the existing stay of the asbestos-related litigation
         against the Borrower granted in the G-I Holdings bankruptcy proceedings
         shall have been terminated or amended or modified in a manner not
         reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, or there shall have
         occurred a substantive consolidation of G-I Holdings with the assets
         and liabilities of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors in
         conjunction with the G-I Holdings bankruptcy proceedings;


                                      101
<PAGE>
then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower,
declare the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender
Party to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by the Issuing Bank
or a Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and Swing Line Advances by a Lender
pursuant to Section 2.02(b)) and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit
to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall
at the request, or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, (A) by notice
to the Borrower, declare the Notes, all interest thereon and all other amounts
payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be forthwith due
and payable, whereupon the Notes, all such interest and all such amounts shall
become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower, (B) by notice to each party required under the terms of any agreement
in support of which a Standby Letter of Credit is issued, request that all
Obligations under such agreement be declared to be due and payable; provided,
however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief
with respect to the Borrower under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (x) the
Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender Party to make
Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by the Issuing Bank or a Lender
pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and Swing Line Advances by a Lender pursuant to
Section 2.02(b)) and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit shall
automatically be terminated and (y) the Notes, all such interest and all such
amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by the Borrower.

         SECTION 6.02. Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit upon Default.
If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders,
irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Section
6.01 or otherwise, make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith upon such
demand the Borrower will, pay to the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lender
Parties in same day funds at the Collateral Agent's office designated in such
demand, for deposit in the L/C Collateral Account, an amount equal to the
aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding. If at any
time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held in the L/C
Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than
the Agents and the Lender Parties or that the total amount of such funds is less
than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the Borrower will,
forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Collateral Agent,
as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Collateral Account, an
amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over (b) the
total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Collateral Account that the
Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and
claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit
in the L/C Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the
Issuing Bank or Lenders, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable
law.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                   THE AGENTS

         SECTION 7.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender Party (in its
capacities as a Lender, the Swing Line Bank (if applicable), and the Issuing
Bank (if applicable)) hereby appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to such Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of
the Notes), no Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lender
Parties and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that no Agent shall be
required to take any action that exposes such Agent to personal liability or
that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. Each Agent agrees to give
to each Lender Party prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither any Agent nor any of their
respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with
the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each Agent:
(a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until, in the case of
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an
Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such
Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, or, in the case of any
other Agent, such Agent has received notice from the Administrative Agent that
it has received and accepted such Assignment and Acceptance, in each case as
provided in Section 8.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel
for any Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected
by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender Party and shall
not be responsible to any Lender Party for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with the Loan
Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance, observance or satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or the existence
at any time of any Default under the Loan Documents or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (e) shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate
or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.


                                      103
<PAGE>
         SECTION 7.03. CUSA and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitments, the
Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, CUSA shall have the same rights
and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender Party and may exercise
the same as though it were not an Agent; and the term "Lender Party" or "Lender
Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include CUSA in its
individual capacity as such. CUSA and its affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Loan
Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that may do business with or own
securities of any Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if CUSA was not an
Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lender Parties. No Agent
shall have any duty to disclose any information obtained or received by it or
any of its Affiliates relating to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries to
the extent such information was obtained or received in any capacity other than
as such Agent.

         SECTION 7.04. Lender Party Credit Decision. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender Party and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement.

         SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. (a) Each Lender Party severally agrees
to indemnify each Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower)
from and against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided
below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by such Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED COSTS"); provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be liable
for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to reimburse each Agent promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 8.04, to the
extent that such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrower. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving
rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05 applies whether any such
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender Party or any
other Person.

                  (b) Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify the
Issuing Bank (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and
against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Issuing
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents; provided,
however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such


                                      104
<PAGE>
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender Party agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and
expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 8.04, to the extent
that the Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrower.

                  (c) For purposes of this Section 7.05, the Lender Parties'
respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time,
according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender Parties, (ii) their
respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding at such time, and (iii) their respective Unused Revolving
Credit Commitments at such time; provided that the aggregate principal amount of
Swing Line Advances owing to the Swing Line Bank and of Letter of Credit
Advances owing to the Issuing Bank shall be considered to be owed to the Lenders
ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. The
failure of any Lender Party to reimburse any Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required
to be paid by the Lender Parties to such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of its
obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender Party shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse such Agent or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lender Party's ratable
share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender
Party contained in this Section 7.05 shall survive the payment in full of
principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents.

         SECTION 7.06. Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and the Borrower and may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders; provided,
however, that any removal of the Administrative Agent will not be effective
until it has also been replaced as Collateral Monitoring Agent, Swing Line Bank
and Issuing Bank and released from all of its obligations in respect thereof
(other than obligations resulting from its gross negligence or willful
misconduct). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Agent,
which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States
or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$250 million. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent and, in the case of a successor Collateral Monitoring Agent,
upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or
amendments thereto, and such amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and
such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the
Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens
granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor
Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,


                                      105
<PAGE>
discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents
(other than duties and obligations resulting from its gross negligence or
willful misconduct). If within 45 days after written notice is given of the
retiring Agent's resignation or removal under this Section 7.06, no successor
Agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted such appointment, then
on such 45th day (a) the retiring Agent's resignation or removal shall become
effective, (b) the retiring Agent shall thereupon be discharged from its duties
and obligations under the Loan Documents (other than duties and obligations
resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) and (c) the Required
Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the retiring Agent under the Loan
Documents until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Agent as provided above. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal
hereunder as Agent shall have become effective, the provisions of this Article
VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.07. Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agents.
(a) It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there
shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the
right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or
trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of
the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative
Agent deems that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it
may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any
of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or
necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that the Administrative
Agent appoint an additional individual or institution as a separate trustee,
co-trustee, collateral monitoring agent, collateral agent, collateral sub-agent
or collateral co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being
referred to herein individually as a "SUPPLEMENTAL COLLATERAL MONITORING AGENT"
and collectively as "SUPPLEMENTAL COLLATERAL MONITORING AGENTS").

                  (b) In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a
Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i)
each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or
conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be
exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent to the
extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral
Monitoring Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to
such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and
every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents necessary to the
exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent
shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or such
Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this
Article and of Section 8.04 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure
to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent and all
references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references
to the Administrative Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Monitoring
Agent, as the context may require.

                  (c) Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be
reasonably required by any Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent so appointed
by the Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and


                                      106
<PAGE>
confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, such Loan
Party shall execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments
promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental
Collateral Monitoring Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable
of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of such Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent, to the extent permitted by
law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the
appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Monitoring Agent.

         SECTION 7.08. The Joint Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the
Co-Documentation Agents. It is understood and agreed by all parties hereto that
neither the Joint Lead Arrangers, nor the Syndication Agent, nor the
Co-Documentation Agents shall have any rights, powers, duties or
responsibilities in such capacity under this Agreement (nor shall any such
rights, powers, duties or responsibilities be read into this Agreement or any
other Loan Document), and shall have no liability for any actions taken or not
taken in such capacity in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents.

                                   ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 8.01. Amendments, Etc. (a) No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor consent
to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed (or, in the case of the
Collateral Documents, consented to) by the Required Lenders, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver
or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lender Parties
(other than any Lender Party that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender), do any
of the following at any time: (i) waive any of the conditions specified in
Section 3.01, (ii) change the number of Lenders or the percentage of (x) the
Commitments, (y) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Advances or (z)
the aggregate Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit that, in each
case, shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action
hereunder, (iii) reduce or limit the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor
under Section 1 of the Subsidiary Guaranty issued by it or release such
Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise limit such Subsidiary Guarantor's liability
with respect to the Obligations owing to the Agents and the Lender Parties
(other than, in the case of any Subsidiary Guarantor, to the extent permitted
under the Subsidiary Guaranty), (iv) release all or substantially all of the
Collateral in any transaction or series of related transactions, (v) amend
Section 2.13 or this Section 8.01, (vi) increase the Commitments of the Lenders
(except in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17), (vii) reduce the
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, (viii) postpone any date scheduled for any payment of principal of,
or interest on, the Notes pursuant to Section 2.04 or 2.07 or any date fixed for
payment of fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (ix) limit the liability of
any Loan Party under any of the Loan Documents or (x) amend or otherwise modify
the definition of "Loan Value" or any component thereof (including, without
limitation, any advance rates included in such definition) so as to increase the
aggregate Loan Value of the Eligible Collateral or any component of such Loan
Value; provided further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may


                                      107
<PAGE>
be, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the
rights or obligations of the Swing Line Bank or of the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, under this Agreement; and provided further that no amendment, waiver or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by an Agent in addition to the
Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of such
Agent under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) In the event that any Lender Party fails to consent to any
amendment, modification or waiver that requires the consent of all of the Lender
Parties (other than any Lender Party that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender)
where the Super Majority Lenders have approved such amendment, modification or
waiver (a "NON-CONSENTING LENDER"), then (subject to (i) such Lender Party's
right to rescind such demand or assertion within five days after the notice from
the Borrower referred to below or (ii) such Non-Consenting Lender consenting to
such amendment, modification or waiver within those five days) the Borrower may,
upon five Business Days' prior written notice to such Lender Party and the
Administrative Agent, elect to cause such Lender Party to assign its Advances
and Commitments in full to one or more Persons selected by the Borrower so long
as (a) each such Person satisfies the criteria of an Eligible Assignee and is
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (b) such Lender Party
receives payment in full in cash of the outstanding principal amount of all
Advances made by it and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other
amounts due and payable to such Lender Party as of the date of such assignment
(including, without limitation, amounts owing pursuant to Sections 2.10, 2.12,
2.15 and 8.04) and (c) each such Lender Party assignee agrees to accept such
assignment and to assume all obligations of such Lender Party hereunder in
accordance with Section 8.07.

         SECTION 8.02. Notices, Etc. (a) All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be either (x) in writing (including telecopier or
telegraphic communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed or delivered or

Section 8.02(a), in an electronic medium and delivered as set forth in Section

to Section 5.01(j)(i) through (vii) shall be delivered to the Administrative

by the Administrative Agent. All such notices and communications shall, when

mails, telecopied, delivered to the telegraph company or confirmed by e-mail,
respectively, except that notices and communications to the Administrative Agent


                                      108
<PAGE>
pursuant to Article II, III or VII shall not be effective until received by the
Administrative Agent. Delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart of any
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes or of any
Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered hereunder shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.

                  (b) So long as CUSA is the Administrative Agent, materials
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(j)(i) through (vii) shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent in an electronic medium in a format
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by e-mail at
timothy.r.singles@citigroup.com. The Borrower agrees that the Administrative
Agent may make such materials, as well as any other written information,
documents instruments and other material relating to the Borrower, or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other materials or matters relating to this Agreement, or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "COMMUNICATIONS")
available to the Lenders by posting such notices on (x) "e-Disclosure," the
Administrative Agent's internet delivery system that is part of SSB Direct,
Global Fixed Income's primary web portal, or (y) "IntraLinks" ((x) or (y), as
applicable, referred to herein as the "PLATFORM"). Although the primary web
portal is secured with a dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization
System and the Platform is secured through a single user per deal authorization
method whereby each user may access the Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis,
the Borrower acknowledges that (i) the distribution of material through an
electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality
and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the Platform is provided
"as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither the Administrative Agent nor any of
its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the
Communications or the Platform and each expressly disclaims liability for errors
or omissions in the communications or the Platform other than those that arise
as a result of such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. No warranty
of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any
warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement
of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by
the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
Platform.

                  (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the
next sentence) (a "NOTICE") specifying that any Communications have been posted
to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information,
documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement;
provided that, if requested by any Lender, the Administrative Agent shall
deliver a copy of the Communications to such Lender by e-mail or telecopier.
Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such
Lender's e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission
(including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender
becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure
that the Administrative Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such
Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

         SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender
Party or any Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or


                                      109
<PAGE>
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

         SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on
demand (i) all reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration (including, without limitation, the fending of
Advances), modification and amendment of, or any consent or waiver under, the
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, (A) all due diligence, collateral
review, syndication (including, without limitation, printing, distribution and
bank meetings), transportation, computer, duplication, messenger, appraisal,
audit, insurance, consultant, search, filing and recording fees and expenses and
(B) the reasonable fees and expenses of one set (including, without limitation,
one main law firm and such additional special or local counsel as may be
reasonably required) counsel for each Agent and the Collateral Agent with
respect thereto, with respect to advising such Agent and the Collateral Agent as
to its rights and responsibilities, or the perfection, protection or
preservation of rights or interests, under the Loan Documents, with respect to
negotiations with any Loan Party or with other creditors of any Loan Party or
any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any Event of Default or any events or
circumstances that may give rise to an Event of Default and with respect to
presenting claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights generally and
any proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all out of pocket costs and expenses
of each Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Lender Party in connection with the
enforcement of the Loan Documents, whether in any action, suit or litigation, or
any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding affecting creditors'
rights generally (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each
Lender Party with respect thereto).

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and save and hold
harmless each Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Lender Party and each of their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors, attorneys and representatives (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and
against, and shall pay on demand, any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
counsel), joint or several, that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded
against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with
or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any
investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in
connection therewith) (i) the Facilities, the actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit, the Transaction Documents or
any of the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, any
acquisition or proposed acquisition (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated hereunder) by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates of all or any portion of the Equity Interests in or Debt
securities or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on
any property of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental
Action relating in any way to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except
to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the
indemnity in this Section 8.04(b) applies, such indemnity shall be effective
whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any


                                      110
<PAGE>
Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or
any other Person, whether or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party
thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereunder are
consummated except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense
is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Borrower also agrees not to assert any claim against any
Agent, any Lender Party or any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors, on any theory of liability,
for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or
otherwise relating to the Facilities, the actual or proposed use of the proceeds
of the Advances or the Letters of Credit, the Transaction Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

                  (c) No Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether
direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries, or any shareholders or creditors of the foregoing for or in
connection with transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such
liability is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In no event, however, shall any Indemnified Party be liable
on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or
anticipated savings).

                  (d) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any
Eurodollar Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a
Lender Party other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance,
as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09(b)(i) or
2.10(d), acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or
for any other reason, or if the Borrower fails to make any payment or prepayment
of an Advance for which a notice of prepayment has been given or that is
otherwise required to be made, whether pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.06 or 6.01 or
otherwise, the Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party any amounts required to compensate such Lender
Party for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur
as a result of such payment or Conversion or such failure to pay or prepay, as
the case may be, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender Party to fund or
maintain such Advance.

                  (e) If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs,
expenses or other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount
may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender Party, in its sole discretion, exercised reasonably.

                  (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower contained in Sections 2.10 and 2.12 and this Section
8.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other
amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents.


                                      111
<PAGE>
         SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.01, each Agent and each Lender Party and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent, such Lender Party
or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against
any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under
the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether such Agent or such Lender Party
shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note or Notes and
although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Agent and each Lender Party
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Agent and each
Lender Party and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Agent, such Lender Party and their respective Affiliates may
have.

         SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and each Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender Party that
such Initial Lender Party has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each Agent and each Lender Party and
their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have
the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of each of the Lender Parties.

         SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may, upon
at least five Business Days' notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note
or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be
of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under
and in respect of any or all of the Facilities, (ii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender,
an Affiliate of any Lender or an Approved Fund of any Lender or an assignment of
all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate
amount of the Commitments being assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to
such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5 million (or such
lesser amount as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of effectiveness of
such assignment, the Borrower), (iii) each such assignment shall be to an
Eligible Assignee, (iv) except in the case of an assignment by a Person that,
immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender, to one of its Affiliates, no
such assignments shall be permitted without the consent of the Administrative
Agent and, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of effectiveness of such assignment, the Borrower (in each case, which
consents shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (v) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together


                                      112
<PAGE>
with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500.

                  (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording,
from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance,
(i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender or
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder and (ii) the Lender or Issuing Bank
assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish
its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 8.04 to the
extent any claim thereunder relates to an event arising prior to such
assignment) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in
the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion
of an assigning Lender's or Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

                  (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
each Lender Party assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder confirm to
and agree with each other and the other parties thereto and hereto as follows:
(i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning
Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility
with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with any Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or observance by any
Loan Party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning Lender Party
or any other Lender Party and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms
that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes each
Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be.

                  (d) The Administrative Agent acting for this purpose (but only
for this purpose) as the agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of, and
principal amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender Party


                                      113
<PAGE>
from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Agents and the Lender Parties shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any
Agent or any Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
clause (b) above, the Advances (including the Notes evidencing such Advances)
are registered obligations and the right, title, and interest of the Lender
Parties and their assignees in and to such Advances shall be transferable only
upon notation of such transfer in the Register. A Note shall only evidence the
Lender Party's or an assignee's right title and interest in and to the related
Advance, and in no event is any such Note to be considered a bearer instrument
or obligation. This Section 8.07 shall be construed so that the Advances are at
all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of sections 163(f),
871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and any related regulations
(or any successor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or such regulations).
Solely for purposes of this and for tax purposes only, the Administrative Agent
shall act as the Borrower's agent for purposes of maintaining such notations of
transfer in the Register.

                  (f) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes
subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C
hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information
contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the
Borrower and each other Agent. In the case of any assignment by a Lender, within
five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own
expense, shall, if requested by the assignee, execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes an amended
and restated Note (which shall be marked "Amended and Restated") to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it under
each Facility pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if any assigning
Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility and has requested
a replacement Note, an amended and restated Note to the order of such assigning
Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such
amended and restated Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

                  (g) The Issuing Bank may assign to an Eligible Assignee all of
its rights and obligations under the undrawn portion of its Letter of Credit
Commitment at any time; provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall
be to an Eligible Assignee and (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

                  (h) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more
Persons (other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without


                                      114
<PAGE>
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and
the Note or Notes (if any) held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender
Party's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its
Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lender
Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender Party in
connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement
and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to
approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any
consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that
such amendment, waiver or consent requires the consent of all Lender Parties.

                  (i) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, however, that, prior to any
such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
received by it from such Lender Party in accordance with the terms of Section
8.10.

                  (j) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any
Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.

                  (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans may create a security
interest in all or any portion of the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes
held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities issued,
by such fund as security for such obligations or securities, provided, that
unless and until such trustee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the
other provisions of this Section 8.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the
pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii)
such trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender
under the Loan Documents even though such trustee may have acquired ownership
rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

                  (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any Lender Party (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to a special purpose funding
vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender
to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an "SPC") the option to provide
all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be
obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement, provided that (i) nothing herein
shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Advance, and (ii) if an SPC
elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of
such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance
pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of an Advance by an SPC hereunder shall
utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if,
such Advance were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees


                                      115
<PAGE>
that (i) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation
under this Agreement for which a Lender Party would be liable, (ii) no SPC shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.12 (or any other increased
costs protection provision) and (iii) the Granting Bank shall for all purposes,
including, without limitation, the approval of any amendment or waiver of any
provision of any Loan Document, remain the Lender Party of record hereunder. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is
one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
paper or other senior Debt of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join
any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the
laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
without prior consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and with the
payment of a processing fee of $500 and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or any portion of its interest in any Advance to the
Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its funding of Advances to any rating agency, commercial
paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee or credit or liquidity
enhancement to such SPC. This subsection (k) may not be amended without the
prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Advances
are being funded by the SPC at the time of such amendment.

         SECTION 8.08. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery by telecopier or electronic mail of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement shall be effective as delivery of an original
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 8.09. No Liability of the Issuing Bank. The Borrower assumes
all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any
Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither the
Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible
for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the
validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by the Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the
Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall
be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential,
damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by (i) the
Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence as determined in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in determining
whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of
the Letter of Credit or (ii) the Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful
payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and
certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank


                                      116
<PAGE>
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary.

         SECTION 8.10. Confidentiality. Neither any Agent nor any Lender Party
shall disclose any Confidential Information to any Person without the consent of
the Borrower, other than (a) to such Agent's or such Lender Party's Affiliates
and their officers, directors, employees, accountants, attorneys, agents and
other advisors (collectively, "LENDER REPRESENTATIVES") and to actual or
prospective Eligible Assignees and participants, and then only on a confidential
basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, (c)
as requested or required by any state, Federal or foreign authority or examiner
(including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar
organization or quasi-regulatory authority) regulating such Lender Party, (d) to
any rating agency when required by it, provided that, prior to any such
disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality
of any Confidential Information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from
such Lender Party, (e) in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which
such Agent or such Lender Party or any of its Affiliates may be a party to the
extent required or requested to so disclose by the applicable Governmental
Authority or (f) in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any Agent or Lender Party may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the U.S. tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions as contemplated hereunder and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such Agent or Lender Party,
relating to such U.S. tax treatment and tax structure.

         SECTION 8.11. Release of Collateral. Upon the sale, lease, transfer or
other disposition of any item of Collateral or the incurrence of Debt (so long
as permitted hereby) in respect of fixed assets of any Loan Party (including,
without limitation, as a result of the sale, in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents, of the Loan Party that owns such Collateral and as a result of
the designation by any Loan Party after the Closing Date of any of its
Subsidiaries as a Non-Recourse Subsidiary) in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent will release its Lien on and security
interest in such Collateral and, at the Borrower's expense, execute and deliver
to such Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to
evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security
interest granted under the Collateral Documents in accordance with the terms of
the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 8.12. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the
United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State
court or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall


                                      117
<PAGE>
affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or Federal
court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

         SECTION 8.13. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

         SECTION 8.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the Borrower, the Agents
and the Lender Parties irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to any of the Loan Documents, the
Advances, the Letters of Credit or the actions of any Agent or any Lender Party
in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

         SECTION 8.15. Required Environmental Tasks.

                  (a) Approved Properties. The Properties listed on Schedule
8.15 attached hereto as or otherwise deemed by the Administrative Agent to be
"Properties Approved For The Borrowing Base" are Eligible Real Property and are
not subject to environmental reporting requirements under this Section 8.15.

                  (b) Conditionally Approved Properties. (i) The Properties
listed on Schedule 8.15 attached hereto as or otherwise deemed by the
Administrative Agent to be "Properties Conditionally Approved For The Borrowing
Base" are Eligible Real Property, subject to the Borrower's compliance with the
provisions of this Section 8.15(b) and to the Administrative Agent's other
rights under this Agreement with respect to the designation of Eligible Real
Property. In respect of each such Property, the Borrower shall, at the
Borrower's sole cost and expense, initiate, diligently prosecute and complete,
within a commercially reasonable time after the date of this Agreement, each
action listed on Schedule 8.15 attached hereto as a "Required Environmental
Task" (each, a "REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL TASK"). In the event that the
Administrative Agent agrees, pursuant to Section 8.15(c) hereof, that all
Required Environmental Tasks for any specific Property Conditionally Approved
For The Borrowing Base have been completed or waived, that Property shall
thereafter be deemed and be treated in all respects as a "Property Approved For
The Borrowing Base".

                  (ii) If the Borrower fails to complete any Required
Environmental Task with respect to a specific Property Conditionally Approved
For The Borrowing Base within a commercially reasonable time and the
Administrative Agent does not agree to waive such Required Environmental Task,
the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower in writing. Within thirty
(30) days after the Borrower receives such notice, the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall discuss in good faith such noncompliance in an effort
to clarify and specify the tasks relating to such Required Environmental Task


                                      118
<PAGE>
that still require completion. In the event that, after the submission of the
next two (2) quarterly reports required by Section 8.15(c) hereof, the
Administrative Agent still determines that completion of the same Required
Environmental Task is not being completed within a commercially reasonable time
and the Administrative Agent does not agree to waive such Required Environmental
Task, the Administrative Agent may deem the applicable Property not to be
Eligible Real Estate.

                  (c) Completion of Required Environmental Tasks. With respect
to Properties Conditionally Approved For The Borrowing Base, until all of the
Required Environmental Tasks are completed to the satisfaction of the
Administration Agent, the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent on
each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 from the Effective Date through
the Termination Date, a report detailing the status of the efforts to complete
such Required Environmental Tasks. In addition to or as a part of such quarterly
reports, when the Borrower completes all Required Environmental Tasks with
respect to a Property, it shall report such completion to the Administrative
Agent.


         SECTION 8.16. Agreement to Comply With Court Order. Each of the Lender
Parties hereby accepts and agrees to abide by all of the terms of the order (the
"APPROVAL ORDER") as set forth in Exhibit H hereto entered by the bankruptcy
court on September 22, 2006 in connection with the G-I Holdings bankruptcy
proceedings and further agrees not to take any action (including, without
limitation, appearing in certain litigation proceedings specified in the
Approval Order) which could result in the loss of any waivers, or other rights
granted in such Approval Order for the benefit of the Agents and/or the Lender
Parties.

         SECTION 8.17. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender Party and each Agent (for
itself and not on behalf of any Lender Party) hereby notifies the Loan Parties
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT ACT (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "PATRIOT ACT"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which
information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other
information that will allow such Lender Party or such Agent, as applicable, to
identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. In such connection,
any Lender Party or Agent may also request corporate formation documents, or
other forms of identification, to verify information provided. The Borrower
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide such information and
take such actions as are reasonably requested by any Agent or any Lender Party
in order to assist the Agents and the Lender Parties in maintaining compliance
with the Patriot Act.

         SECTION 8.18. Assignment by Existing Lenders. Each Existing Lender
hereby agrees to sell and assign on the Effective Date, in accordance with
Section 2.01(a), to any Initial Lender, such portion of such Existing Lender's
rights and obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement, including, without
limitation, any outstanding loans or advances thereunder and any participation
in any Existing Letters of Credit, as shall be required for the Revolving Credit
Commitments of each Initial Lender (including without limitation, any such
Existing Lender in its capacity as an Initial Lender), to be as set forth on
Schedule I, with each such Initial Lender holding a Pro Rata Share of the
outstanding Revolving Credit Advances, in each case for an amount equal to the


                                      119
<PAGE>
principal balance of all such loans sold and assigned by such Existing Lender.
Each Existing Lender assigning its rights and obligations under the Existing
Credit Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.18: (i) makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Loan
Document or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security
interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, any
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;
and (ii) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the performance or
observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under any Loan Document
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto. No Existing
Lender that is not also an Initial Lender shall have any liability or obligation
under this Agreement or the Loan Documents. Each Existing Lender agrees that,
upon the Administrative Agent's request, it shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance to evidence such sale and
purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if the assigned
loans are evidenced by Notes) subject to such Assignment and Acceptance;
provided, however, that the failure of such Existing Lender to execute an
Assignment and Acceptance shall not render such sale and purchase (and the
corresponding assignment) invalid.

Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
as of the date first above written.
