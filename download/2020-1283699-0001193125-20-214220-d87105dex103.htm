derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator,
the &#147;<U>IBA</U>&#148;) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an
appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used
in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in Section&nbsp;1.10(a) of this Agreement, such Section&nbsp;1.10(a) provides a
mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent may amend this Agreement together with the Borrower, pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10(a), in advance of or after any change to the reference rate upon which the
interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the
London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of &#147;LIBO Rate&#148; or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or
characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.10(a), will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the

of such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section&nbsp;6.3 and (y)&nbsp;determining the amount of Indebtedness that may be
incurred pursuant to clause (i)(A) of Section&nbsp;6.3(b), the Borrower may elect, pursuant to an Officers&#146; Certificate delivered to the Administrative Agent, to treat all or any portion of the commitment under any Indebtedness (and any
refinancing with respect thereto) as being incurred at such time, in which case any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment or refinancing, as the case may be, shall not be deemed, for purposes of this calculation, to be an
incurrence at such subsequent time. The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of
Preferred Stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles or the application thereof, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this Section&nbsp;6.3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section&nbsp;6.3, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
may incur pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.3 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values, and in no event shall the reclassification of any lease or other liability as indebtedness due to
a change in accounting principles after the Closing Date be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness. In determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding under one of the clauses of Section&nbsp;6.3(b), the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness of any Person shall be counted only once and any obligation of such Person or any other Person arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness shall be disregarded so
long as it is permitted to be incurred by the Person or Persons incurring such obligation. </P>

is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Section&nbsp;5f.103-1(c)</FONT> of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in such Lender&#146;s Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, including payments of
interest and principal, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. The portion of the Participant Register relating to any Participant requesting payment from the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made available to the Borrower upon
