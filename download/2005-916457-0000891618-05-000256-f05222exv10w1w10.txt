                                CREDIT FACILITIES

      2.1   TERM LOAN FACILITY.

            2.1.1 Total Term Loan Commitment. Notwithstanding anything that may
be construed to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate principal amount
of all Term Loans made by the Lenders shall not exceed $264,900,000 (the "Total
Term Loan Commitment").

            2.1.2 Availability; Term Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, in reliance upon the representations and warranties
of Borrower set forth herein and without limiting each Lender's several
obligation to pay Administrative Agent its Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit on
the Closing Date as provided in Section 2.8.2(c) below, each Lender severally
agrees to make, on the Closing Date, a term loan under this Section 2.1.2
(individually a "Term Loan" and, collectively, the "Term Loans") to Borrower in
an amount equal to such Lender's Proportionate Share of the Total Term Loan
Commitment. Borrower may make only one borrowing under the Total Term Loan
Commitment, which shall be on the Closing Date. Any amount borrowed under this
Agreement and subsequently repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. All amounts
owed hereunder with respect to the Term Loans shall be paid in full no later
than the Maturity Date.

            2.1.3 Borrowing Mechanics for Term Loans.

            (a) Notice of Borrowing and LC Activity. On or before the date which
is three Banking Days prior to the Closing Date, Borrower shall deliver to
Administrative Agent a written notice in the form of Exhibit C-1, appropriately
completed (the "Notice of Borrowing and LC Activity"). Such Notice of Borrowing
and LC Activity shall be delivered by first-class mail, facsimile or electronic
mail to Administrative Agent at the office, to the facsimile number or to the
electronic mail address and during the hours specified in Section 11.1.
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents of such
Notice of Borrowing and LC Activity.

            (b) Lender Funding. Each Lender shall make the Term Loan to be made
by it hereunder available to Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New
York City time) on the Closing Date, by wire transfer of same day funds in
Dollars, to the account designated for such purpose from time to time by
Administrative Agent. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
specified in Article 3 and subject to Sections 2.1.4(b) and 2.1.5,
Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of the Term Loans available to
Borrower on the Closing Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars
equal to the proceeds of all such Term Loans received by Administrative Agent
from the Lenders to be credited to one or more accounts as may be designated in
writing to Administrative Agent by Borrower.

            2.1.4 Amount of Term Loans; Availability of Funds.

            (a) Amount of Term Loans. All Term Loans shall be made by the
Lenders simultaneously in the amount of their respective Term Loan Commitment,
it being understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any
other Lender in such other Lender's obligation to make a Term Loan hereunder nor
shall any Term Loan Commitment of any Lender

                                       2

<PAGE>

be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in such
other Lender's obligation to make a Term Loan hereunder.

            (b) Availability of Funds. Unless Administrative Agent shall have
been notified by any Lender prior to the Closing Date that such Lender does not
intend to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's
Proportionate Share of the Total Term Loan Commitment, Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such amount available to Administrative Agent
on such date in accordance with the prior paragraph and Administrative Agent
may, in its sole discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to Borrower a corresponding amount on such date. If such corresponding amount is
not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender,
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on
demand (and, in any event, within three Banking Days from the Closing Date) from
such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the Closing Date
until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds
Rate for the first three Banking Days after the Closing Date. If such Lender
pays such amount to Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lender's Proportionate Share of the Total Term Loan Commitment. If such Lender
does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's
demand therefore or within three Banking Days from the Closing Date,
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Borrower shall
immediately pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together with
interest thereon (but no penalty or premium), for each day from the Closing Date
until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the rate then
payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Term Loans. Nothing in this Section
2.1.4(b) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill
its obligations hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrower may have
against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

            2.1.5 Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall apply the proceeds of the Term
Loans on the Closing Date as follows: (a) $220,269,515.28 shall be applied to
indefeasibly fund the Payout Amount, (b) $1,304,000 shall be applied to fund the
anticipated O&M Costs to be incurred by Borrower during the 30 days immediately
following the Closing Date, (c) $17,511,000 shall be applied to fund the
Pre-Funded Punchlist Expense Account, (d) to pay the fees and expenses then due
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, (e) $19,287,403.76 shall be
applied to fund a distribution to Sponsor representing the repayment of capital
initially provided to finance the construction or purchase of, or repairs,
improvements or additions to, the Site and/or the Project (such distribution,
the "Rocky Mountain Closing Date Distribution") and (f) as otherwise set forth
on Exhibit G-2. Borrower shall not use any portion of the proceeds of any Term
Loan in any manner that causes or might cause the funding of the Term Loans or
the application of such proceeds to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or
Regulation X or any other regulation of the Federal Reserve Board.

            2.1.6 Term Loan Principal Payment. Borrower shall repay to
Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Term Loan made by such Lender (as reduced in connection
with any voluntary prepayment or Mandatory Prepayments of, or any accepted
Mandatory Repayment Offers on, the Term Loans, in accordance with Section
2.1.10) in installments payable on each Principal Repayment Date following the
Closing Date in accordance with the repayment schedule set forth on Exhibit I,

                                       3

<PAGE>

with any remaining unpaid principal, interest, fees and costs due and payable on
the Maturity Date.

            2.1.7 Interest Provisions Relating to Term Loans.

            (a) Term Loan Interest. Except as otherwise set forth herein,
Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan
from the Closing Date until the maturity or prepayment thereof at one of the
following rates per annum:

                  (i) With respect to the principal portion of such Term Loan
which is, and during such periods as such Term Loan is, a Base Rate Term Loan,
at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (such rate to change from time to
time as the Base Rate shall change) plus 3.25%.

                  (ii) With respect to the principal portion of such Term Loan
which is, and during such periods as such Term Loan is, a LIBOR Term Loan, at a
rate per annum during each Interest Period for such LIBOR Term Loan equal to the
LIBO Rate for such Interest Period plus 4.25%.

            (b) Applicable Interest Rate. Subject to Section 2.3.3, the
applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any Term
Loan shall be selected by Borrower initially at the time the Notice of Borrowing
and LC Activity is given pursuant to Section 2.1.3(a). The basis for determining
the interest rate with respect to any Term Loan may be changed from time to time
as specified in a Notice of Conversion of Loan Type delivered pursuant to
Section 2.1.9. If on any day a Term Loan is outstanding with respect to which
notice has not been delivered to Administrative Agent in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate
of interest, then for that day such Term Loan shall bear interest determined by
reference to the Base Rate. Borrower shall not request, and the Lenders shall
not be obligated to make, LIBOR Term Loans at any time an Event of Default
exists.

            (c) Interest Payment Dates. Borrower shall pay accrued interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan (i) on each Interest Payment Date,
and (ii) in all cases, upon repayment or prepayment (to the extent thereof and
including Mandatory Prepayments and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement,
any optional prepayments), upon conversion from one Type of Loan to another Type
of Loan and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise).

            (d) LIBOR Term Loan Interest Periods.

                  (i) The initial Interest Period for all LIBOR Term Loans made
on the Closing Date shall be from the Closing Date through October 29, 2004.
Thereafter, each subsequent Interest Period selected by Borrower for all LIBOR
Term Loans shall be one, two, three or six months or, to the extent that nine or
twelve month Interest Periods are available to all Lenders, nine or twelve
months. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences,
(A) any Interest Period for LIBOR Term Loans which would otherwise end on a day
which is not a Banking Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Banking Day
unless such next Banking Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such
Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding Banking Day; (B) any
Interest Period for LIBOR Term Loans

                                       4

<PAGE>

which begins on the last Banking Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which
there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of
such Interest Period) shall end on the last Banking Day of a calendar month; (C)
Borrower may not select Interest Periods for LIBOR Term Loans which would leave
a greater principal amount of Term Loans subject to Interest Periods for LIBOR
Term Loans ending after a date upon which Term Loans are or may be required to
be repaid (including the Maturity Date and each Principal Repayment Date) than
the principal amount of Term Loans scheduled to be outstanding after such date;
(D) any Interest Period for a Term Loan which would otherwise end after the
Maturity Date shall end on the Maturity Date; (E) LIBOR Term Loans for each
Interest Period shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (F) Borrower may not at any time have
outstanding more than five different Interest Periods relating to LIBOR Term
Loans; and (G) Borrower shall select Types and Interest Periods for Term Loans
corresponding to the "types" and "interest periods" used for floating rate
payments in the Interest Rate Agreements so as to create, to the greatest extent
possible, a complete hedge.

                  (ii) Borrower may contact Administrative Agent at any time
prior to the end of an Interest Period for LIBOR Term Loans for a quotation of
Interest Rates in effect at such time for given Interest Periods and
Administrative Agent shall promptly provide such quotation. Borrower may select
an Interest Period for LIBOR Term Loans telephonically or by electronic mail
within the time periods specified in Section 2.1.9, which selection shall be
irrevocable on and after commencement of the applicable Minimum Notice Period.
Borrower shall confirm such telephonic or electronic mail notice to
Administrative Agent by facsimile on the day such notice is given by delivery to
Administrative Agent of a written notice in substantially the form of Exhibit
C-2, appropriately completed (a "Confirmation of Interest Period Selection"). If
Borrower fails to notify Administrative Agent of the next Interest Period for
any LIBOR Term Loans in accordance with this Section 2.1.7(d)(ii), such Term
Loans shall automatically convert to Base Rate Term Loans on the last day of the
current Interest Period therefor. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
Borrower of each determination of the Interest Rate applicable to each Term
Loan.

            (e) Interest Computations. All computations of interest on Base Rate
Term Loans shall be based upon a year of 365 days or, in the case of a leap
year, 366 days, shall be payable for the actual days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day), and shall be adjusted in accordance with
any changes in the Base Rate to take effect on the beginning of the day of such
change in the Base Rate. All computations of interest on LIBOR Term Loans shall
be based upon a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Borrower agrees
that all computations by Administrative Agent of interest shall be conclusive
and binding in the absence of manifest error.

            2.1.8 Promissory Notes. The obligation of Borrower to repay the Term
Loans made by a Lender and to pay interest thereon at the rates provided herein
shall, upon the written request of such Lender, be evidenced by promissory notes
in the form of Exhibit B (individually, a "Note" and, collectively, the
"Notes"), each payable to the order of such requesting Lender and in the
principal amount of such Lender's Term Loan Commitment. Borrower authorizes each
such requesting Lender to record on the schedule annexed to such Lender's Note,
the date and amount of the Term Loan made by such requesting Lender, and each
payment or prepayment of principal thereunder and agrees that all such notations
shall constitute prima facie evidence of

                                       5

<PAGE>

the matters noted; provided that in the event of any inconsistency between the
records or books of Administrative Agent and any Lender's records or Note, the
records of Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding in the absence
of manifest error. Borrower further authorizes each such requesting Lender to
attach to and make a part of such requesting Lender's Note continuations of the
schedule attached thereto as necessary. No failure to make any such notations,
nor any errors in making any such notations, shall affect the validity of
Borrower's obligations to repay the full unpaid principal amount of the Term
Loans or the duties of Borrower hereunder or thereunder. Upon the payment in
full in cash of the aggregate principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid
interest on, the Term Loans, the Lenders holding such Notes shall promptly mark
the applicable Notes cancelled and return such cancelled Notes to Borrower.

            2.1.9 Conversion of Loans. Borrower may convert Term Loans from one
Type of Term Loans to another Type of Term Loans; provided, however, that (i)
any conversion of LIBOR Term Loans into Base Rate Term Loans shall be effective
on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Term Loans
and (ii) Term Loans shall be converted only in amounts of $5,000,000 and
increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Borrower shall request such a
conversion by delivering to Administrative Agent a written notice in the form of
Exhibit C-3, appropriately completed (a "Notice of Conversion of Loan Type"),
which contains or specifies, among other things:

            (a) the Term Loans, or portion thereof, which are to be converted;

            (b) the Type of Term Loans into which such Term Loans, or portion
thereof, are to be converted;

            (c) if such Term Loans are to be converted into LIBOR Term Loans,
the initial Interest Period selected by Borrower for such Term Loans (which
Interest Period shall be selected in accordance with Section 2.1.7(d) and if an
Interest Period is not so designated a one month Interest Period shall be deemed
selected by Borrower);

            (d) the proposed date of the requested conversion (which shall be a
Banking Day and otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.1.9; and

            (e) a certification by Borrower that no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

Borrower shall so deliver each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type so as to
provide at least the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Any Notice of Conversion
of Loan Type may be modified or revoked by Borrower through the Banking Day
prior to the Minimum Notice Period, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. Each
Notice of Conversion of Loan Type shall be delivered by first-class mail,
facsimile or electronic mail to Administrative Agent at the office, to the
facsimile number or to the electronic mail address and as otherwise specified in
Section 11.1; provided, however, that Borrower shall promptly deliver to
Administrative Agent the original of any Notice of Conversion of Loan Type
initially delivered by facsimile or electronic mail. Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the contents of each Notice of Conversion of Loan
Type.

            2.1.10 Prepayments.

            (a) Terms of All Prepayments.

                  (i) Upon the prepayment of any Term Loan (whether such
prepayment is an optional prepayment under Section 2.1.10(b) or a Mandatory
Prepayment), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the
Lender which made such Term Loan and/or Hedge Lender, as applicable, (A) all
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount of such Term Loan
prepaid, (B) all accrued fees to the date of such prepayment relating to the
amount of such Term Loan being prepaid, (C) to the extent required by the terms
of the applicable Interest Rate Agreement, all Hedge Breaking Fees owed by
Borrower to such Hedge Lender as a result of such prepayment, and (D) if such
prepayment is the prepayment of a LIBOR Term Loan on a day other than the last
day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Term Loan, all Liquidation Costs
incurred by such Lender as a result of such prepayment (pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.6).

                  (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but only in respect of any
Mandatory Prepayment of Term Loans (other than a Mandatory Prepayment resulting
from any Mandatory Repayment Offer accepted by a Lender), Borrower shall have
the right, by giving three Banking Days' notice to Administrative Agent, in lieu
of prepaying a LIBOR Term Loan on a day other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such LIBOR Term Loan, to deposit or cause Administrative Agent to
deposit into an account to be held by Depositary Agent (which account shall be
subjected to the Lien of the Collateral Documents in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Collateral Agent) an amount equal to the LIBOR Term Loans to be
prepaid. Such funds shall be held in such account until the expiration of the
Interest Period applicable to the LIBOR Term Loan to be prepaid at which time
the amount deposited in such account shall be used to prepay such LIBOR Term
Loan and any interest accrued on such amount shall be deposited into the Revenue
Account. All Term Loans to be prepaid using the proceeds from such account shall
continue to accrue interest at the then applicable interest rate for such Term
Loans until actually prepaid. All amounts in such account shall only be invested
in Permitted Investments as directed by and at the expense and risk of Borrower.

                  (iii) All prepayments of Term Loans shall be applied to reduce
the remaining payments required under Section 2.1.6 in inverse order of
maturity. Borrower may not re-borrow the principal amount of any Term Loan which
is prepaid.

                  (iv) Other than with respect to any Mandatory Prepayment of
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits as provided in Section 2.8.2(b)(i) and any
repayment required or permitted on or before the Maturity Date in connection
with a Funded LC Disbursement, the aggregate amount to be prepaid or returned on
any date pursuant to the Credit Documents (including this Section 2.1.10 and
Section 3.2.2 of the Depositary Agreement) shall be applied first to the
prepayment (to the extent of funds required to be so applied) of Term Loans
outstanding on such date and thereafter (to the extent of any residual and
subject at all times to the following sentence) to the reimbursement of Funded
LC Credit-Linked Deposits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event that any prepayment under the Credit Documents would
result in the aggregate stated amount of the PSCo Letter of Credit exceeding the
aggregate amount on deposit in or credited to the Credit-Linked Deposit

                                       7

<PAGE>

Account, Borrower shall (on or before the date of such prepayment) deposit cash
with Administrative Agent for ultimate credit to the Credit-Linked Deposit
Account in an amount equal to such excess and Borrower authorizes Administrative
Agent to apply such amounts in the manner provided in Section 2.8.2.

            (b) Optional Prepayments.

                  (i) Borrower may not voluntarily prepay Term Loans except as
provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2.1.10(b).

                  (ii) In the event any voluntary prepayment is permitted under
this Agreement in accordance with clause (iii) of this Section 2.1.10(b),
Borrower may prepay any such Term Loans on any Banking Day in whole or in part,
in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000,000 (or the remaining amount outstanding) in excess of that amount. All
such prepayments shall be made upon (A) in the case of Base Rate Term Loans, one
Banking Day's prior written, email or telephonic notice to Administrative Agent
by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) and (B) in the case of LIBOR Term Loans, three
Banking Days' prior written, email or telephonic notice to Administrative Agent
by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) and in each case, if given by telephone,
promptly confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent (and Administrative Agent
will promptly notify each Lender of such notice). Upon the giving of any such
notice, the principal amount of the Term Loans specified in such notice shall
become due and payable on the prepayment date specified therein. Any prepayment
of any Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.1.10(b) shall be applied in
accordance with Sections 2.4.1 and 9.10. In connection with any optional
prepayments under this Section 2.1.10(b), Borrower shall terminate or partially
terminate Hedge Transactions such that the notional amount under all of the
Hedge Transactions does not exceed, in the aggregate, the principal amount of
Terms Loans outstanding immediately after giving effect to such prepayment.

                  (iii) Borrower shall not voluntarily prepay Term Loans at any
time on or prior to June 24, 2007. At any time after June 24, 2007, Borrower may
voluntarily prepay Term Loans pursuant to the applicable provision below:

                        (1) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.1.10(b),
Borrower may, at its option prepay at any time all, or from time to time any
part of, the Term Loans, if such prepayment is (x) after June 24, 2007 but on or
before June 24, 2008, in an amount equal to 102% of the principal amount of the
Term Loans so prepaid, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and other
amounts owed hereunder in connection with such prepayment (including amounts
payable under Sections 2.5 and 2.6 hereof), or (y) after June 24, 2008 but on or
before June 24, 2009, in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount so
prepaid, plus all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts thereon owed
hereunder in connection with such prepayment (including amounts payable under
Sections 2.5 and 2.6 hereof); and

                        (2) Subject to Section 2.1.10(a) and clause (ii) of this
Section 2.1.10(b), Term Loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or
penalty after June 24, 2009.

                                       8

<PAGE>

            (c) Mandatory Prepayments. Borrower shall prepay (or cause to be
prepaid) Term Loans to the extent required by Section 3.2.2(b), 3.2.2(c) or 3.5
of the Depositary Agreement, Section 2.1.10(d) (to the extent any Mandatory
Repayment Offer is accepted by a Lender), Section 2.8.2(b)(i) or 7.2 of this
Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document
which requires such prepayment (such prepayment, a "Mandatory Prepayment").

            (d) Mandatory Repayment Offers. In the event that, pursuant to
Section 5.13, Borrower shall be required to offer to prepay Term Loans and
Funded LC Disbursements and return Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, then
Borrower shall make an offer to each Lender (a "Mandatory Repayment Offer") in
accordance with the following procedures specified below:

                  (i) Borrower shall make a Mandatory Repayment Offer under this
Agreement within 30 days following a Change of Control and shall keep such
Mandatory Repayment Offer open until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date
specified in such Mandatory Repayment Offer, which date shall be no earlier than
30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such Mandatory Repayment Offer
was made, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable
law (the "Offer Period");

                  (ii) Borrower shall make the Mandatory Repayment Offer by
sending a notice to Administrative Agent (for delivery to each Lender) in
accordance with Section 11.1. The notice shall contain all instructions and
materials necessary to enable the Lenders to accept the Mandatory Repayment
Offer for all of their Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits pursuant to the Mandatory Repayment Offer. The Mandatory
Repayment Offer shall be made to all Lenders. The notice, which shall govern the
terms of the Mandatory Repayment Offer, shall state:

                        (A) the total amount Borrower is offering to prepay (the
"Offer Amount"), which amount shall be an amount equal to at least the sum of
(1) 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans and Funded LC
Disbursements then outstanding, plus (2) 1% of the amount of Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits, plus (3) in each case, accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, to but excluding the date of repayment, plus (4) in each case, any
other amount then required to be paid hereunder, and the Mandatory Repayment
Date therefor;

                        (B) that Riverside Borrower is making the same offer to
the Riverside Lenders to purchase the Riverside Term Loans;

                        (C) that the Mandatory Repayment Offer is being made
pursuant to this Section 2.1.10(d) and Section 5.13 and the date on which the
Mandatory Repayment Offer shall end;

                        (D) that, unless Borrower defaults in making such
payment, any Term Loan with respect to which a Lender accepts the Mandatory
Repayment Offer shall cease to accrue interest from and after the Mandatory
Repayment Date;

                                       9

<PAGE>

                        (E) that Borrower shall, on the Mandatory Repayment
Date, deposit cash in an aggregate amount equal to the Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits of all Lender's accepting such Mandatory Repayment Offer;

                        (F) that a Lender that accepts a Mandatory Repayment
Offer must accept such Mandatory Repayment Offer with respect to all (but not
part) of its Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits and all (but not part) of its Riverside Term Loans; and

                        (G) that the Lenders shall be entitled to withdraw their
acceptance of a Mandatory Repayment Offer if Borrower and Administrative Agent
receive, not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a notice setting
forth the name of the Lender, the principal amount of the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit, Term Loans and Funded LC Disbursements and Riverside Term
Loans for which the Lender previously accepted such Mandatory Repayment Offer
and a statement that such Lender is rescinding its acceptance of such Mandatory
Repayment Offer under this Agreement and under the Riverside Credit Agreement;
and

                  (iii) On or before the fifth day after the termination of the
Offer Period (the "Mandatory Repayment Date"), Borrower shall (A) to the extent
lawful, pay, in accordance with Sections 2.4.1 and 9.10, the amount of Term
Loans and Funded LC Disbursements with respect to which the Mandatory Repayment
Offer was accepted (together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to
but excluding the date of repayment and any other amount then required to be
paid under this Agreement), (B) unless such Mandatory Repayment Offer is
accepted by all Lenders and Riverside Lenders, deposit cash in an aggregate
amount equal to all Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits returned as part of such
Mandatory Payment Offer with Administrative Agent for ultimate deposit in the
Credit-Linked Deposit Account for application as provided in Section 2.8.2, and
(C) deliver to Administrative Agent (for delivery to the Lenders) a certificate
duly executed by a Responsible Officer stating the amount of the Term Loans and
Funded LC Disbursements to be repaid and the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits to
be returned by Administrative Agent to the Lender's accepting such Mandatory
Repayment Offer in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.1.10(d).
Administrative Agent shall promptly forward the appropriate amount to each
Lender being repaid. Issuing Bank and each Lender hereby authorize
Administrative Agent to release to the Lender accepting any such Mandatory
Repayment Offer on the Mandatory Repayment Date an aggregate amount of funds on
deposit in or credited to the Credit-Linked Deposit Account equal to the amount
of cash deposited by Borrower with Administrative Agent in respect of the
replacement of such Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits as set forth in Borrower's
Mandatory Repayment Offer and as contemplated by this Section 2.1.10(d).

      2.2 FEES.

            2.2.1 Borrower agrees to pay to, as applicable, each Lender and each
of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent and Lead Arranger
the fees and expenses in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon by
Borrower and such Person in writing, including those fees and expenses set forth
in the Fee Letters.

                                       10

<PAGE>

            2.2.2 Borrower agrees to pay (a) to Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in
the PSCo Letter of Credit, which participation fee shall accrue at a rate equal
to the sum of (i) a rate per annum equal to 4.25% on the Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits plus (ii) 0.10% on the average daily amount of such Lender's
Proportionate Share of the Total Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed Funded LC Disbursements) during the
period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the
date on which such Lender's Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit is returned to it
and the Maturity Date and (b) to Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
at a rate per annum equal to .20% on the average daily aggregate face amount of
the PSCo Letter of Credit during the period from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date the PSCo Letter of Credit is cancelled, expires or
drawn in full, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the
issuance or amendment of the PSCo Letter of Credit or processing of drawings
thereunder. Accrued participation fees in respect of the PSCo Letter of Credit
shall be due and payable on the each Interest Payment Date and accrued fronting
fees in respect of the PSCo Letter of Credit shall be due and payable monthly;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits are returned to the Lenders and any such fees accruing
after the date on which the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits are returned to the
Lenders shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section 2.2.2 shall be payable within ten days after demand.
All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

      2.3 OTHER PAYMENT TERMS.

            2.3.1 Place and Manner. Except as otherwise provided in the Fee
Letters or any other provision contained in any of the Credit Documents,
Borrower shall make all payments due to any Lender, Collateral Agent, Issuing
Bank or Administrative Agent hereunder to Administrative Agent, for the account
of such Lender, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent (as the
case may be), to the account designated for such purpose from time to time by
Administrative Agent to Borrower, in Dollars and in immediately available funds
not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date on which such payment is due. Any payment
made after such time on any day shall be deemed received on the Banking Day
after such payment is received. Administrative Agent shall disburse to each
Lender, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) each such payment
received by Administrative Agent for such Lender, Issuing Bank or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be), such disbursement to occur on the day such payment
is received if received by 1:00 p.m. or if otherwise reasonably possible, or
otherwise on the next Banking Day.

            2.3.2 Date. Whenever any payment due hereunder shall fall due on a
day other than a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Banking Day, and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of
interest or fees, as the case may be, without duplication of any interest or
fees so paid in the next subsequent calculation of interest or fees payable.

            2.3.3 Default Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default,
the outstanding principal

                                       11

<PAGE>

amount of all Term Loans and Funded LC Disbursements and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any accrued but unpaid interest
payments thereon and any accrued but unpaid fees and other amounts hereunder,
shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any
proceeding under applicable Bankruptcy Laws) payable upon demand at a rate that
is (a) 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate then otherwise payable under
this Agreement with respect to the applicable Term Loans or Funded LC
Disbursements or (b) in the case of any such fees and other amounts, at a rate
that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate then otherwise payable under
this Agreement for Base Rate Term Loans (the "Default Rate"); provided that, in
the case of LIBOR Term Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period in
effect at the time any such increase in interest rate is effective, such LIBOR
Term Loans shall thereupon become Base Rate Term Loans and shall thereafter bear
interest payable upon demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the
interest rate then otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Term
Loans.

            2.3.4 Taxes.

            (a) Payments to Be Free and Clear. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 2.3.4 and in Section 9.9, all sums payable by or on behalf of
Borrower or any of its Affiliates hereunder and under the other Credit Documents
shall (except to the extent required by any applicable Legal Requirement) be
paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of,
any Tax imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the U.S.
or any political subdivision in or of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction from or
to which a payment is made by or on behalf of Borrower or such Affiliate.

            (b) Withholding of Taxes. If Borrower or any other Person is
required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any such Tax
from any sum paid or payable by or on behalf of Borrower to Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or any Lender under any of the Credit
Documents but excluding, for purposes of this Section 2.3.4, the Interest Rate
Agreements, including the Hedge Transactions thereunder:

                  (i) Borrower shall notify Administrative Agent of any such
requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as Borrower becomes
aware of it;

                  (ii) Borrower shall pay any such Tax before the date on which
penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is
imposed on Borrower or such other Person) for its own account or (if that
liability is imposed on such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing
Bank or Lender, as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of such
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender;

                  (iii) the sum payable by Borrower or such other Person in
respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required
shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of
all deductions, withholding or payments for or with respect to Taxes, such
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender, as the case may
be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had
no such deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and

                                       12

<PAGE>

                  (iv) within 30 days after paying any sum from which it is
required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after
the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required by clause (ii) of this
Section 2.3.4(b) to pay, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence
satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction, withholding or
payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority;

provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to any
Lender, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent under clause
(iii) of this Section 2.3.4(b) except to the extent that any change after the
date hereof (in the case of each Lender, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and
Collateral Agent listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or
after the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which such
Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), as the case may be,
in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as is mentioned
therein shall result in either the imposition of deduction, withholding or
payment or an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment
from the rate in effect at the date hereof or at the date of such Assignment and
Acceptance, as the case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender,
Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent.

            (c) Other Taxes. Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
taxing or other authority in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, and
shall comply with the requirements of this Section 2.3.4 with respect to such
payments.

            (d) Indemnification. Subject to the provisions below and the
provisions of Section 9.9, Borrower shall indemnify Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes (to
the extent Borrower would be required to pay additional amounts with respect to
such Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.3.4) or Other Taxes arising in connection
with payments made under any of the Credit Documents (including any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section
2.3.4) paid by such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or
Lender and any penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses arising from
or with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes, whether or not such Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally asserted; provided that Borrower shall not be
obligated to indemnify such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank
or Lender for any penalties, interest or expenses relating to Taxes or Other
Taxes arising from such Administrative Agent's, Collateral Agent's, Issuing
Bank's or Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Lender and each
of Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and Collateral Agent agrees to give
written notice to Borrower of the assertion of any claim against such Lender,
Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent relating to such Taxes or
Other Taxes as promptly as is practicable after being notified of such
assertion, and in no event later than 180 days after the principal officer of
such Lender, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent responsible
for administering this Agreement obtains knowledge thereof; provided that any
Lender's, Administrative Agent's, Issuing Bank's or Collateral Agent's failure
to notify Borrower of such assertion within such 180 day period shall not
relieve Borrower of its obligation under this Section 2.3.4 with respect to
Taxes or Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses arising prior to the end
of such period, but shall relieve Borrower of its obligations under this Section
2.3.4 with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses
between the end of such period and such time as Borrower receives notice from
such Lender, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent as

                                       13

<PAGE>

provided herein. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days
from the date any Lender, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Collateral Agent
makes written demand therefor. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail
the amount of such indemnification payment and the basis for determining such
indemnification payment, shall be submitted by such Person to Borrower and
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower
for purposes of this Agreement.

            (e) Evidence of Exemption From U.S. Withholding Tax. Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and each Lender that is not a United
States Person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent for transmission to Borrower, on or prior to the Closing
Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the
Closing Date) or on or prior to the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at
such other times as may be necessary in the determination of Borrower or the
Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion):

                  (i) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed
by such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender, and such
other documentation required under the Code and reasonably requested by Borrower
to establish that such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or
Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax with respect to any payments to such Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
payable under any of the Credit Documents or is subject to such deduction or
withholding at a reduced rate; or

                  (ii) if such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing
Bank or Lender is not a "bank" or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of
the Code and is claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under
Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio
interest", a Certificate Re Non-Bank Status in the form of Exhibit J hereto,
together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or any
successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender, and such other documentation
required under the Code and reasonably requested by Borrower to establish that
such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender is not
subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
respect to any payments to such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing
Bank or Lender of interest payable under any of the Credit Documents.

Each Person required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with
respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to this
Section 2.3.4 hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by
such Person of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in
time or change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other
evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Person shall
promptly deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to Borrower two new
original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or a
Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8, as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by
such Person, and such other documentation required under the Code and

                                       14

<PAGE>

reasonably requested by Borrower to confirm or establish that such Person is not
subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with
respect to payments to such Person under the Credit Documents or is subject to
such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate, or notify Administrative Agent
and Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other
evidence. Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount to
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or any Non-U.S. Lender
under this Section 2.3.4 or to indemnify Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent,
Issuing Bank or any Non-U.S. Lender under this Section 2.3.4 if such Person
shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence
referred to in the second sentence of this Section 2.3.4(e), or (2) to notify
Administrative Agent and Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms,
certificates or other evidence, as the case may be; provided, if such Person
shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of this Section
2.3.4(e) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which it became a Lender, as applicable, nothing in this last
sentence of this Section 2.3.4(e) shall relieve Borrower of its obligation to
pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.3.4(b) or to indemnify such
Non-U.S. Lender under Section 2.3.4(d) in the event that, as a result of any
change in any applicable Legal Requirement, or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such Person is no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing the fact that such Person is not subject to withholding as
described herein. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the form provided by
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or a Lender at the time
such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender first
becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a U.S. withholding tax rate in
excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from
Taxes.

            2.3.5 Application of Payments. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein or in the other Credit Documents, payments made under this
Agreement or the other Credit Documents and other amounts received by
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent, Issuing Bank or the
Lenders under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall first be
applied to any fees, costs, charges or expenses payable to Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent, Issuing Bank or the Lenders hereunder or
under the other Credit Documents, next to any accrued but unpaid interest then
due and owing, and then to outstanding principal then due and owing or otherwise
to be prepaid (in each case, such application to be made on a pro rata basis
among such applicable Persons).

      2.4 PRO RATA TREATMENT.

            2.4.1 Borrowings, Commitment Reductions, Etc. Except as otherwise
provided herein, (a) the Closing Date Borrowing of Term Loans and any reduction
of Total Term Loan Commitment and the Closing Date funding of the Total Funded
LC Credit-Linked Deposits shall be made or allocated among the Lenders pro rata
according to their respective Proportionate Shares of the Total Term Loan
Commitment or Total Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, as the case may be, (b)
except in the case of a Mandatory Repayment Offer pursuant to Section 2.1.10(d)
whereby payments shall be allocated to each accepting Lender's Term Loans,
Funded LC Disbursements and Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits (and not to all
Lenders based on Proportionate Shares) and subject to Section 2.1.10(a)(iv),
each payment of principal of and interest on Term Loans or Funded LC
Disbursements (as the case may be) or return of Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits
shall be made or shared among the Lenders holding such Term

                                       15

<PAGE>

Loans or Funded LC Disbursements or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits (as the
case may be) pro rata according to their respective unpaid principal amounts of
such Term Loans or Funded LC Disbursements or amounts of Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits (as the case may be) held by such Lenders, and (c) each payment of any
fees payable to all Lenders shall be shared among the Lenders pro rata according
to (i) their respective Proportionate Shares of such fees, and (ii) in the case
of each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement hereunder after the
Closing Date, the date upon which such Lender so became a party hereunder.

            2.4.2 Sharing of Payments, Etc. Except in the case of a Mandatory
Repayment Offer pursuant to Section 2.1.10(d) whereby payments shall be
allocated to each accepting Lender's Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits (and not to all Lenders based on Proportionate
Shares), if any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of Term
Loans or Funded LC Disbursements owed to it or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits
to be returned to it, in excess of its Proportionate Share of payments on
account of such Term Loans or Funded LC Disbursements or Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits obtained by all Lenders entitled to such payments, such Lender shall
forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participation in the Term Loans
or Funded LC Disbursements or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, as the case may
be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such
purchase from such Lender shall be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay
to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery
together with an amount equal to such other Lender's Proportionate Share
(according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such other Lender's required
repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing
a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.4.2 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

      2.5 CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

            2.5.1 Inability to Determine Rates. If, on or before the first day
of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements or
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, (a) Administrative Agent determines that the
LIBO Rate for such Interest Period cannot be adequately and reasonably
determined due to the unavailability of funds in or other circumstances
affecting the London interbank market, or (b) Lenders holding aggregate
Proportionate Shares of 33-1/3% or more of the outstanding Term Loans, Funded LC
Disbursements or Total Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits shall advise
Administrative Agent that (i) the rates of interest for such LIBOR Term Loans,
Funded LC Disbursements or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits do not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Term
Loans, Funded LC Disbursements or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit or (ii)
deposits in Dollars in the London interbank market are not available to such
Lenders (as conclusively certified by each such Lender in good faith in writing
to Administrative Agent and to Borrower) in the ordinary course of business in
sufficient amounts to make and/or maintain their LIBOR Term Loans, Funded LC
Disbursements or Funded LC

                                       16

<PAGE>

Credit-Linked Deposit, then Administrative Agent shall immediately give notice
of such condition to Borrower. After the giving of any such notice and until
Administrative Agent shall otherwise notify Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such condition no longer exist, (x) Borrower's right to request
the making of or conversion to, and the Lenders' obligations to make or convert
to, LIBOR Term Loans shall be suspended, (y) any LIBOR Term Loans outstanding at
the commencement of any such suspension shall be converted at the end of the
then current Interest Period for such Term Loans into Base Rate Term Loans
unless such suspension has then ended and (z) the Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits shall be invested so as to earn a return equal to the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

            2.5.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption
of any Governmental Rule, any change in any Governmental Rule or the application
or requirements thereof (whether such change occurs in accordance with the terms
of such Governmental Rule as enacted, as a result of amendment, or otherwise),
any change in the interpretation or administration of any Governmental Rule by
any Governmental Authority, or compliance by any Lender or Borrower with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law, but if not having
the force of law, being of a type with which a Lender customarily complies) of
any Governmental Authority (a "Change of Law") shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Term Loan, then such
Lender shall immediately notify Administrative Agent and Borrower of such Change
of Law. Upon receipt of such notice, (a) Borrower's right to request the making
of or conversion to, and the Lender's obligations to make or convert to, LIBOR
Term Loans shall be suspended for so long as such condition shall exist, and (b)
Borrower shall, at the request of such Lender, either (i) pursuant to Section
2.1.9, convert any then outstanding LIBOR Term Loans into Base Rate Term Loans
at the end of the current Interest Periods for such Term Loans, or (ii)
immediately repay, to the extent otherwise permitted under this Agreement,
pursuant to Section 2.1.10 or convert LIBOR Term Loans of the affected Type into
Base Rate Term Loans if such Lender shall notify Borrower that such Lender may
not lawfully continue to fund and maintain such Term Loans. Any conversion or
prepayment of LIBOR Term Loans made pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to
the last day of an Interest Period for such Term Loans shall be deemed a
prepayment thereof for purposes of Section 2.6.

            2.5.3 Increased Costs. If, after the date of this Agreement, any
Change of Law:

            (a) shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with
respect to any LIBOR Term Loan or Term Loan Commitment in respect thereof, or
shall change the basis of taxation of payments by Borrower to any Lender on such
a Term Loan or with respect to any such Term Loan Commitment (except for Taxes,
Other Taxes or the imposition of or changes in the rate of taxation on the
overall net income of any Lender); or

            (b) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement (without duplication of any reserve requirement
included within the applicable Interest Rate through the definition of "Reserve
Requirement") against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for
the account of, advances or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds by any
Lender for any LIBOR Term Loan; or

                                       17

<PAGE>

            (c) shall impose on any Lender any other condition directly related
to any LIBOR Term Loan or Term Loan Commitment in respect thereof;

and the effect of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, issuing, creating, renewing, participating in (subject to the
limitations in Section 9.12) or maintaining any such LIBOR Term Loan or Term
Loan Commitment in respect thereof or to reduce any amount receivable by such
Lender hereunder, then Borrower shall from time to time, within ten days after
demand by such Lender, pay to such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
reimburse such Lender for such increased costs or to compensate such Lender for
such reduced amounts. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount of such increased costs or reduced amounts and the basis for
determination of such amount, submitted by such Lender to Borrower, shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower for
purposes of this Agreement.

            2.5.4 Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that (a) any
Change of Law after the date of this Agreement increases the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, or the Lending Office of
such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender (a "Capital Adequacy
Requirement"), and (b) the amount of capital maintained by such Lender or such
Person which is attributable to or based upon the Term Loans, the Term Loan
Commitment or this Agreement must be increased as a result of such Capital
Adequacy Requirement (taking into account such Lender's or such Person's
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then Borrower shall pay to such
Lender or such Person, within ten days after delivery of demand by such Lender
or such Person, such amounts as such Lender or such Person shall reasonably
determine are necessary to compensate such Lender or such Person for the
increased costs to such Lender or such Person of such increased capital. A
certificate of such Lender or such Person, setting forth in reasonable detail
the computation of any such increased costs, delivered to Borrower by such
Lender or such Person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on Borrower for purposes of this Agreement.

            2.5.5 Notice; Lenders' Rights. Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent
and each Lender shall notify Borrower of any event occurring after the date of
this Agreement that will entitle Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent or such
Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.5, as promptly as practicable,
and in no event later than 180 days after the principal officer of Issuing Bank
or such Lender responsible for administering this Agreement obtains knowledge
thereof; provided that Issuing Bank's, Administrative Agent's or any Lender's
failure to notify Borrower within such 180 day period shall not relieve Borrower
of its obligation under this Section 2.5 with respect to claims arising prior to
the end of such period, but shall relieve Borrower of its obligations under this
Section 2.5 with respect to the time between the end of such period and such
time as Borrower receives notice from the indemnitee as provided herein. No
Person purchasing from a Lender a participation or assignment in any Term Loan,
Term Loan Commitment, Funded LC Disbursement or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit
shall be entitled to any payment from or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.5.3 or Section 2.5.4 which would be in excess of the applicable
proportionate amount (based on the portion of the Term Loan, Total Term Loan
Commitment, Funded LC Disbursement or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit in which
such Person is participating) which would then be payable to such Lender if such
Lender had not sold a participation or assignment in that portion of the Term
Loan, Term Loan Commitment, Funded LC Disbursement or Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposit.

      2.6 FUNDING LOSSES.

            If (x) Borrower shall (a) repay or prepay any LIBOR Term Loans or
Funded LC Disbursement or reduce any Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit (other than
in connection with the funding of a Funded LC Disbursement) on any day other
than the last day of an Interest Period for such Term Loans, Funded LC
Disbursement or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit (whether an optional prepayment
or a Mandatory Prepayment), (b) fail to borrow any LIBOR Term Loans in
accordance with the Notice of Borrowing and LC Activity delivered to
Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any
applicable conditions or otherwise) after such Notice of Borrowing and LC
Activity has become irrevocable, (c) fail to convert any Term Loans into LIBOR
Term Loans in accordance with a Notice of Conversion of Loan Type delivered to
Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any
applicable conditions or otherwise) after such Notice of Conversion of Loan Type
has become irrevocable, (d) fail to continue a LIBOR Term Loan in accordance
with a Confirmation of Interest Period Selection delivered to Administrative
Agent, or (e) fail to make any prepayment in accordance with any notice of
prepayment delivered to Administrative Agent, or (y) Issuing Bank makes a Funded
LC Disbursement from amounts on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account on
any day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits, then Borrower shall, within ten days after demand by
Administrative Agent or any Lender, reimburse Administrative Agent or such
Lender for all reasonable costs and losses incurred by Administrative Agent or
such Lender as a result of such repayment, prepayment or failure or making of a
Funded LC Disbursement ("Liquidation Costs"). Borrower understands that such
costs and losses may include losses incurred by Administrative Agent or a Lender
as a result of funding and other contracts entered into by Administrative Agent
or such Lender to fund LIBOR Term Loans (other than non-receipt of the margin
applicable to such LIBOR Term Loans). In the case of a Funded LC Disbursement
bearing interest by reference to the LIBO Rate or a Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposit, such loss, cost or expense to any applicable Lender or Administrative
Agent shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender or
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to be the excess, if any, of (x) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such
Funded LC Disbursement or on the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit had such event
not occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Funded LC
Disbursement or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit, for the period from the date of
such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would
have been the Interest Period for such Funded LC Disbursement or Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London
interbank market. Administrative Agent or a Lender demanding payment under this
Section 2.6 shall deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for and the amount of costs and losses for which demand is
made. Such a certificate so delivered to Borrower shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount of such loss for
purposes of this Agreement.

      2.7 ALTERNATE OFFICE; MINIMIZATION OF COSTS.

            2.7.1 To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate
an alternative Lending Office with respect to its LIBOR Term Loans, Funded LC
Disbursement and Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit and otherwise take any
reasonable actions to reduce any liability of Borrower to any Lender under
Section 2.3.4, 2.5.3, 2.5.4 or 2.6, or to avoid the unavailability of any Type
of Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursement or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit under
Section 2.5.2 so long as (in the case of the designation of an alternative
Lending Office) such Lender, in its sole discretion, determines that (a) such
designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender and (b) such actions would
eliminate or reduce liability to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or actions within ten Banking Days of demand thereof to Borrower.

            2.7.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event
that:

            (a) any Lender (an "Increased-Cost Lender") shall give notice to
Borrower that such Lender is a Lender is entitled to receive payments under
Sections 2.3.4 or 2.5, (ii) the circumstances which have caused such Lender to
be an Increased-Cost Lender or which entitle such Lender to receive such
payments shall remain in effect, and (iii) such Lender shall fail to withdraw
such notice within five Business Days after Borrower's request for such
withdrawal; or

            (b) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification,
termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof as
contemplated by Section 9.8, the consent of Majority Lenders, Supermajority
Lenders or all necessary Lenders, as the case may be, shall have been obtained,
except for one or more of such other Lenders (each a "Non-Consenting Lender")
whose consent is required shall not have been obtained;

then, with respect to each such Increased-Cost Lender or Non-Consenting Lender
(the "Terminated Lender"), Borrower may, by giving written notice to
Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so, elect
to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably
agrees) to assign its outstanding Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and Funded
LC Credit Linked Deposit in full to one or more Eligible Assignees who are
reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent (each a "Replacement Lender") in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.12 (including the requirement that
the Terminated Lender assign its outstanding Riverside Term Loans to such
Replacement Lender in accordance with the Riverside Credit Agreement) and
Borrower shall pay any fees payable thereunder in connection with such
assignment; provided:

                  (i) on the date of such assignment, the Replacement Lender
and/or Borrower shall pay to such Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum
of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all
outstanding Term Loans and Funded LC Disbursements of the Terminated Lender, and
(B) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees owing to such
Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.2;

                                       20

<PAGE>

                  (ii) on the date of such assignment, the Borrower shall pay
any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section 2.3.4 or 2.5;
provided that no premium on such amounts shall be required to be paid;

                  (iii) in the event such Terminated Lender is a Non-Consenting
Lender, each Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of such assignment,
to each matter in respect of which such Terminated Lender was a Non-Consenting
Lender; and

                  (iv) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
at the time of such termination and replacement (other than, in the case of a
replacement predicated upon clause (b) above, the Event of Default that is the
subject of the vote referred to in clause (b) above).

Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender, such
Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" under any of the Credit
Documents; provided, any rights of such Terminated Lender to indemnification
hereunder shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

            2.7.3 Upon written notice to Administrative Agent, any Lender may
designate a Lending Office other than the Lending Office most recently
designated to Administrative Agent and may assign all of its interests under the
Credit Documents and its Notes (if any) to such Lending Office; provided that
such designation and assignment do not at the time of such designation and
assignment increase the reasonably foreseeable liability of Borrower under
Section 2.3.4, 2.5.3 or 2.5.4 or make an Interest Rate option unavailable
pursuant to Section 2.5.2.

      2.8 CREDIT-LINKED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT; PSCO LETTER OF CREDIT.

            2.8.1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account.

            (a) The Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits shall be held by Issuing
Bank in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, and no party other than Issuing Bank
shall have a right of withdrawal from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account or any
other right or power with respect to the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the funding obligation of each
Lender in respect of its participation in the PSCo Letter of Credit shall be
satisfied in full upon the funding of its Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit.

            (b) Each of Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and each Lender
hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Lender is funding its Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit to Issuing Bank for application in the manner contemplated
by Section 2.8.2(c) and that Issuing Bank shall invest the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits in LIBO Rate investments so as to earn a return (except
during periods when such Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, or funds advanced by
Issuing Bank against such Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, are used to cover
unreimbursed Funded LC Disbursements, and subject to Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6)
for the Lenders equal at any time to (i) the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period
in effect for the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits at such time minus (ii)
0.10%. Such earned amount minus 0.10% will be

                                       21

<PAGE>

paid to the Lenders by Issuing Bank, who shall accomplish the same by paying
such amounts to Administrative Agent in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.
Upon Administrative Agent's receipt of such amounts from Issuing Bank,
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay all amounts it receives from Issuing
Bank to the Lenders.

            (c) Borrower shall have no right, title or interest in or to the
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits and no obligations with respect thereto (except
to refund portions thereof used to fund Funded LC Disbursements as provided in
Section 2.8.2(d) and pay other amounts provided herein related thereto), it
being acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that the making of the
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits by the Lenders, the provisions of this Section
2.8.1 and the application of the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits in the manner
contemplated by Section 2.8.2(c) constitute agreements among Administrative
Agent, Issuing Bank and each Lender with respect to the funding obligations of
each Lender in respect of its participation in PSCo Letter of Credit and do not
constitute any loan or extension of credit to Borrower.

            (d) Issuing Bank shall promptly provide to Administrative Agent such
information as Administrative Agent may require to provide such information to
Borrower and/or the Lenders as is required hereunder.

            2.8.2 PSCo Letter of Credit.

            (a) Request for Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, on or before the date which is three Banking Days prior to the Closing
Date, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent the Notice of Borrowing and
LC Activity referred to in Section 2.1.3(a) requesting that Issuing Bank issue
the PSCo Letter of Credit as of the Closing Date. The PSCo Letter of Credit
shall be issued to PSCo in accordance with the terms of the Power Purchase
Agreement, shall have an expiration date of June 24, 2011 and shall have an
aggregate stated amount on the Closing Date equal to $28,100,000.

            (b) Reduction of Stated Amount of PSCo Letter of Credit; Immaterial
Changes.

                  (i) Upon at least three Banking Days' prior written notice to
Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank delivered in accordance with Section 11.1,
Borrower may permanently reduce the stated amount of the PSCo Letter of Credit;
provided, however, that (A) such notice shall include a statement executed by
each of Borrower and PSCo confirming that the aggregate amount of the PSCo
Security Fund has been permanently reduced by an amount equal to such reduction
in the stated amount and that Borrower shall have no further obligation to
increase the stated amount of such PSCo Letter of Credit at any time following
any such reduction, and (B) after giving effect to such reduction, Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits on deposit in or credited to the Credit-Linked Deposit
Account (together with any other amounts on deposit in or credited to the
Credit-Linked Deposit Account in replacement thereof) shall equal the
then-current stated amount of the PSCo Letter of Credit. In the event the stated
amount of the PSCo Letter of Credit shall be reduced as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, Issuing Bank shall return, in accordance with
Section 2.1.10(c), all such amounts on deposit in or credited to the
Credit-Linked Deposit Account in excess of the stated amount of the PSCo Letter

                                       22

<PAGE>

of Credit (as so reduced) to Administrative Agent who shall promptly return the
same to the Lenders ratably in accordance with their Proportionate Share of the
Total Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit Commitment.

                  (ii) Borrower may request immaterial amendments to or
modifications of the PSCo Letter of Credit by delivering to Administrative Agent
and Issuing Bank in accordance with Section 11.1, (A) a written notice
describing the terms of the PSCo Letter of Credit to be amended or modified and
such other information as shall be necessary to prepare such amended PSCo Letter
of Credit and (B) a certificate from a Responsible Officer of Borrower stating
that such amendment or modification is required by the terms of the Power
Purchase Agreement. Issuing Bank shall have the right, but shall have no
obligation, to make such immaterial modifications to the PSCo Letter of Credit
as Borrower may from time to time request in writing as provided above. Issuing
Bank shall promptly provide Administrative Agent with a copy of any such
amendment or modification to the PSCo Letter of Credit.

            (c) Participation. On the Closing Date, without any further action
on the part of Issuing Bank or the Lenders, Issuing Bank hereby grants to each
Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from Issuing Bank, a participation in
the PSCo Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Proportionate Share of the
aggregate amount available to be drawn under such PSCo Letter of Credit. The
aggregate purchase price for the participations of each Lender in the PSCo
Letter of Credit shall equal the amount of the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit
of such Lender. Each Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent its Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit in full on the Closing Date. Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay the same to Issuing Bank. The Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit made
by such Lender on the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 2.8.2 (as such
deposit may be reduced from time to time pursuant to the Credit Documents and
reduced or increased from time to time pursuant to assignments by or to such
Lender pursuant to Section 9.12) is set forth on Exhibit H, or in the Assignment
and Acceptance pursuant to which such Lender shall have acquired its Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit, as applicable. The aggregate amount of the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits on the Closing Date is $28,100,000. Each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees that if Issuing Bank makes a Funded LC
Disbursement which is not reimbursed by Borrower as provided in Section
2.8.2(d), or is required to refund any reimbursement payment in respect of a
Funded LC Disbursement to Borrower for any reason, Issuing Bank may withdraw an
amount from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account equal to the amount of such Funded
LC Disbursement, ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their
Proportionate Share of the Total Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit, from such
Lender's Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit
Account. In the event the Credit-Linked Deposit Account is charged by Issuing
Bank to reimburse itself for an unreimbursed Funded LC Disbursement, Borrower
shall have the right, at any time prior to the Maturity Date, to pay over to
Administrative Agent in reimbursement thereof an amount equal to the amount so
charged for deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, and in such event
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay the same to Issuing Bank. In the event
that any reimbursement shall be due to Issuing Bank under the preceding
provisions of this Section on a day other than the last day of an Interest
Period in effect for the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, Issuing Bank shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to advance its own funds to cover the
amount due to Issuing Bank, in which case (i) title to an amount of each
Lender's Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit equal to its Proportionate Share of the
amount so advanced by Issuing Bank (together with the interest accruing thereon)

                                       23

<PAGE>

shall automatically be transferred to Issuing Bank, which shall reimburse itself
for the amount advanced by it through the liquidation of such amounts of the
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits at the end of the applicable Interest Period,
and (ii) Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Issuing
Bank, upon Administrative Agent's or Issuing Bank's request therefor, the
amount, if any, by which Issuing Bank's cost of funds for the period from the
date of such reimbursement of Issuing Bank through the end of the applicable
Interest Period shall exceed the interest accrued on a like amount of the Funded
LC Credit-Linked Deposits at the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period. A
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such costs and the
basis for determination of such amount, submitted by Issuing Bank to Borrower,
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower
for purposes of this Agreement. In the event Borrower shall fail to pay any
amount due under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the interest payable by
Issuing Bank to the Lenders on their Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits under
Section 2.8.1(b) shall be correspondingly reduced and the Lenders shall without
further act succeed, ratably in accordance with their Proportionate Share, to
the rights of Issuing Bank with respect to such amount. Each Lender acknowledges
and agrees that its obligation to acquire and fund participations in respect of
the PSCo Letter of Credit pursuant to this clause (ii) is absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of the PSCo Letter of Credit or
the occurrence and continuance of an Inchoate Default or Event of Default or the
return of the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender irrevocably authorizes Issuing Bank
to apply the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits as provided in this Section 2.8.2.
In addition, each Lender hereby grants to Issuing Bank a security interest in
such Lender's Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit to secure its obligations under
this Section 2.8.2.

            (d) Reimbursement.

                  (i) If Issuing Bank shall make any Funded LC Disbursement,
Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to Administrative Agent an amount equal
to the entire amount of such Funded LC Disbursements on the Maturity Date. If
Borrower does not so reimburse Issuing Bank for any such Funded LC Disbursement,
without limiting any other right or remedy of any Lender hereunder,
reimbursement of Issuing Bank shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 2.8.2(d).

                  (ii) Except in connection with any repayment of Funded LC
Disbursements prior to the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.1.10, if any
Funded LC Disbursement that shall have been funded from the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits shall be reimbursed other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable to the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits, Issuing Bank
shall invest the amount so reimbursed in overnight or short-term cash equivalent
investments until the end of the Interest Period at the time in effect and
Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Issuing Bank upon
Administrative Agent's or Issuing Bank's request therefor, the amount, if any,
by which the interest accrued on a like amount of the Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect therefor shall
exceed the interest earned through the investment of the amount so reimbursed
for the period from the date of such reimbursement through the end of the
applicable Interest Period. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount of such costs and the

                                       24
<PAGE>

basis for determination of such amount, submitted by Issuing Bank to Borrower,
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower
for purposes of this Agreement. In the event Borrower shall fail to pay any
amount due under this Section, the interest payable by Issuing Bank to the
Lenders on their Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits under Section 2.8.2(b) shall
be correspondingly reduced and the Lenders shall without further act succeed,
ratably in accordance with their Proportionate Shares, to the rights of Issuing
Bank with respect to such amount.

                  (iii) If Issuing Bank shall make any Funded LC Disbursement,
and Borrower has not reimbursed Issuing Bank for such Funded LC Disbursement by
1:00 p.m. on the date that is two Banking Days after the date such Funded LC
Disbursement is made (it being acknowledged and agreed that Borrower is
obligated to make such reimbursement only on the Maturity Date), on such date,
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable unreimbursed
Funded LC Disbursement and such Lender's Proportionate Share thereof, and
Issuing Bank shall promptly withdraw amounts from the Credit-Linked Deposit
Account to reimburse itself each Lender's Proportionate Share of such Funded LC
Disbursement from such Lender's Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit (or from funds
of Issuing Bank as contemplated by the sixth sentence of Section 2.8.2(c)(ii)).
Promptly following receipt by Administrative Agent of any payment pursuant to
Sections 2.8.2(d) (i) or (ii) in respect of any Funded LC Disbursement,
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to Issuing Bank or, to the
extent payments have been made from the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits or from
funds of Issuing Bank to reimburse itself in connection with an unreimbursed
Funded LC Disbursement, to the Credit-Linked Deposit Account to be added to the
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits of the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Proportionate Share or to reimburse Issuing Bank, as the case may be.
Any payment made from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, or from funds of
Issuing Bank, pursuant to this Section to reimburse Issuing Bank for any Funded
LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Term Loan and shall not relieve Borrower
of its obligation, if any, to reimburse such Funded LC Disbursement.

            (e) Obligations Absolute. Borrower's obligation to reimburse Funded
LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.8.2(d) shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Power Purchase
Agreement, the PSCo Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision
therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under the PSCo Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by
Issuing Bank under the PSCo Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not comply with the terms of such PSCo Letter of
Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section 2.8.2(e), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a
right of setoff against, Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, Issuing Bank or any of their Related Parties
shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with
the issuance or transfer of the PSCo Letter of Credit or any payment or failure
to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances
referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption,
loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other
communication under or relating to the PSCo Letter of Credit (including any
document required

                                       25

<PAGE>

to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or
any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of Issuing Bank; provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse Issuing Bank from liability
to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the
extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by
Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under the PSCo Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of Issuing Bank (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), Issuing Bank shall be deemed
to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of the PSCo Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank
may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
PSCo Letter of Credit.

            (f) Disbursement Procedures. Issuing Bank shall, promptly following
its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for
payment under the PSCo Letter of Credit. Issuing Bank shall promptly notify, in
accordance with Section 11.1, Administrative Agent and Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether Issuing Bank has
made or will make a Funded LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such
Funded LC Disbursement.

            (g) Interim Interest. If Issuing Bank shall make any Funded LC
Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse such Funded LC Disbursement
in full on the date such Funded LC Disbursement is made, in each case the unpaid
amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date
such Funded LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that Borrower
reimburses such Funded LC Disbursement or Issuing Bank reimburses such Funded LC
Disbursement with funds held in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, at the LIBO
Rate for the Interest Period at the time in effect for the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits plus 4.25% per annum; provided that, if Borrower fails to
reimburse such Funded LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.8.2(d),
then Section 2.3.3 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this Section
2.8.2(g) shall be for the account of Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued
on and after the date of payment from the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit of any
Lender (or with funds of Administrative Agent pending the application of such
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit) to reimburse Issuing Bank shall be for the
account of such Lender or Administrative Agent, as applicable, to the extent of
such payment.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            Borrower makes the following representations and warranties to and
in favor of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, Lead Arranger

expressly relates solely to another time), all of which shall survive the
Closing Date and the making of the Term Loans, the funding of the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits and the issuance of the PSCo Letter of Credit:

      4.2   AUTHORIZATION; NO CONFLICT.

            Borrower has duly authorized, executed and delivered each Operative
Document to which Borrower is a party (or such Operative Documents have been
duly and validly assigned to Borrower and Borrower has authorized the assumption
thereof, and has assumed the obligations of the assignor thereunder) and neither
Borrower's execution and delivery thereof nor its consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby nor its compliance with the terms thereof (a)
does or will contravene the Governing Documents or any other Legal Requirement
applicable to or binding on Borrower or any of its properties which, in the case
of such Legal Requirements, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, (b) does or will contravene or result in any breach of or
constitute any default under, or result in or require the creation of any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its property under, any material
agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties may be bound or affected or (c) does or will require the material
consent or approval of any Person, and with respect to any Governmental
Authority, does or will require any material registration with, or notice to, or
any other action of, with or by any applicable Governmental Authority, in each
case which has not already been obtained and disclosed in writing to
Administrative Agent (except as set forth on Exhibit G-1 or otherwise provided
in Sections 4.9.1 and 4.9.2).

      4.3   ENFORCEABILITY.

            Each of the Operative Documents to which Borrower is a party is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

                                       36

<PAGE>

moratorium, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights or by the effect of general equitable principles (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

      4.4   COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

            There are no material violations by Borrower or, to Borrower's
knowledge, any Calpine Entity, of any Legal Requirement (including any Hazardous
Substance Laws). No notices of any material violation of any Legal Requirement
(including any Hazardous Substance Laws) relating to the Project or the Site
have been issued, entered or received by Borrower or, to Borrower's knowledge,
any Calpine Entity.

      4.5   BUSINESS, DEBT, CONTRACTS, JOINT VENTURES ETC.

            4.5.1 Borrower has not conducted any business other than the
business contemplated by the Operative Documents and, through the Closing Date,
the Existing Rocky Mountain Credit Agreement, does not have any outstanding Debt
or other material liabilities other than pursuant to or allowed by the Operative
Documents, and Borrower is not a party to or bound by any material contract
other than the Credit Documents and the Major Project Documents to which it is a
party.

            4.5.2 Borrower is not a general partner or a limited partner in any
general or limited partnership or a joint venturer in any joint venture.

            4.5.3 Borrower does not have any Subsidiaries.

any of the prohibitions set forth in any Anti-Terrorism Law.

            4.6.4 No broker or other similar agent (other than the Lead
Arranger) is acting for the benefit of Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or
benefiting in any capacity, in each case in connection with the Credit
Documents.

      4.7   INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.

            Neither Borrower nor any other Calpine Entity is an investment
company or a company controlled by an investment company, within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

      4.8   ERISA.

            Either (a) there are no ERISA Plans or Multiemployer Plans for any
Calpine Entity or any ERISA Affiliate or (b) (i) each Calpine Entity and each
ERISA Affiliate have fulfilled their obligations (if any) under the minimum
funding standards of ERISA and the Code for each ERISA Plan, (ii) each such
ERISA Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the currently
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and (iii) neither any Calpine Entity
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to the PBGC or an ERISA Plan
or Multiemployer Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums
due in the ordinary course). None of any Calpine Entity's assets constitute
assets of an employee benefit plan within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section
2510.3-101. Borrower does not maintain or contribute to, and is not obligated to
contribute to, nor has it at any point of its existence maintained or
contributed to, or been obligated to contribute to, any employee-benefit plan
subject to ERISA.

      4.9   PERMITS.

            4.9.1 There are no material Permits under existing Legal
Requirements as the Project is currently designed that are or will become
Applicable Permits other than the Permits

                                       38

<PAGE>

listed in Exhibit G-1 hereto. Except as disclosed in Exhibit G-1 (as so
supplemented), each Permit listed in Part I(A) of Exhibit G-1 is in full force
and effect and is not subject to any current legal proceeding or to any
Unsatisfied Condition that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and all applicable appeal periods with respect thereto have
expired. Each Permit listed in Part II(A) of Exhibit G-1 is of a type that is
routinely granted upon submission of a timely application and demonstration that
the Project complies with applicable standards and Legal Requirements. No Permit
listed in Part II(A) is required under applicable Legal Requirement or Project
Documents to be obtained before the time contemplated to be obtained by
Borrower. No fact or circumstance exists, to Borrower's knowledge, which makes
it likely that any Permit identified in Part II(A) of Exhibit G-1 shall not be
timely obtainable by Borrower before it becomes an Applicable Permit without
expense materially in excess of amounts provided therefor in the Base Case
Project Projections. Borrower is in compliance in all material respects with all
Applicable Permits.

            4.9.2 To Borrower's knowledge, there are no Permits under existing
Legal Requirements as the Project is currently designed that are or will become
Applicable Third Party Permits other than the Permits listed in Exhibit G-1
hereto other than those, the failure of which to obtain could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To Borrower's knowledge, except as
disclosed in Exhibit G-1, each Permit listed in Part I(B) of Exhibit G-1 is in
full force and effect and is not subject to current legal proceeding or to any
Unsatisfied Condition that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and all applicable appeal periods with respect thereto have
expired. No fact or circumstance exists, to Borrower's knowledge, which makes it
likely that any Permit identified in Part II(B) of Exhibit G-1 shall not be
timely obtainable by the applicable Person as identified in Exhibit G-1 at a
cost consistent with the Base Case Project Projections before it becomes an
Applicable Third Party Permit. Except as disclosed in Exhibit G-1, to Borrower's
knowledge, each Person as identified in Exhibit G-1 possesses and is in
compliance in all material respects with its respective Applicable Third Party
Permits.

      4.10  HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.

            4.10.1 Except as set forth in Exhibit G-6: (a) Borrower, with
respect to the Site, Improvements or other Mortgaged Property, is not or has not
in the past been in violation of any Hazardous Substance Law which violation
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Borrower or
its properties and assets or in an inability of Borrower to perform its
obligations under the Operative Documents; (b) neither Borrower nor, to
Borrower's knowledge, any other Person has used, Released, generated,
manufactured, produced or stored in, on, under, or about the Site, Improvements
or other Mortgaged Property, or transported thereto or therefrom, any Hazardous
Substances that could reasonably be expected to subject any Secured Party to
liability, or Borrower to material liability, under any Hazardous Substance Law;
(c) to Borrower's knowledge, there are no underground tanks, whether operative
or temporarily or permanently closed, located on the Site, Improvements or other
Mortgaged Property that could reasonably be expected to subject any Secured
Party to liability, or Borrower to material liability, under any Hazardous
Substance Law; (d) there are no Hazardous Substances used, stored or present at
or on the Site, Improvements or other Mortgaged Property, except in compliance
with Hazardous Substance Laws and other Legal Requirements or as disclosed in
the Environmental Reports; (e) to Borrower's knowledge, there are no Hazardous
Substances that

                                       39

<PAGE>

could reasonably be expected to migrate onto the Site, Improvements or other
Mortgaged Property that could reasonably be expected to impose on Borrower a
material liability, except as disclosed in the Environmental Reports; and (f) to
Borrower's knowledge there neither is nor has been any condition, circumstance,
action, activity or event that could reasonably be expected to be, or result in,
a material violation by Borrower of any Hazardous Substance Law, or to result in
liability to any Secured Party or material liability to Borrower under any
Hazardous Substance Law.

            4.10.2 Except as set forth on Exhibit G-5 or Exhibit G-6, there is
no pending or, to Borrower's knowledge, threatened in writing, action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority (including the Colorado Public
Utilities Commission, Colorado Department of Natural Resources, Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment, County of Weld, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) or any other Person which is
not a Governmental Authority with respect to the presence or Release of
Hazardous Substances in, on, from or to the Site, Improvements or other
Mortgaged Property.

            4.10.3 Except as set forth in the Environmental Reports, to
Borrower's knowledge, there are no past violations that have not been finally
resolved or existing violations of any Hazardous Substances Laws by any Person
affecting the Site, Improvements or other Mortgaged Property, which violations
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Borrower.

      4.11  LITIGATION.

            (a) No action, suit, proceeding or investigation has been instituted
or, to Borrower's knowledge, threatened in writing against Borrower.

            (b) Borrower has no knowledge of (i) any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that has been instituted or threatened in writing against, the
Riverside Borrower, the Sponsor or any other Major Project Participant, or by
which any of them or their properties are bound, which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any order, judgment or
decree that has been issued or proposed to be issued by any Governmental
Authority that, as a result of the ownership or operation of the Project by
Borrower, the sale of electricity therefrom by Borrower or the entering into of
any Operative Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, could
reasonably be expected to cause or deem the Lenders, Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, the Lead Arranger or Borrower or any Affiliate
of any of them to be subject to, or not exempted from, regulation under PUHCA,
or treated as a public utility under the laws of the State of Colorado as
presently constituted and as construed by the courts of Colorado, respecting the
rates or the financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. No
action, suit or proceeding before or by any court, arbitrator or other
Governmental Authority is pending to which any Calpine Entity is a party or to
which its business, assets or property is subject and, to Borrower's knowledge,
no such action, suit or proceeding is threatened to which any such Calpine
Entity or its business, assets or property would be subject that, in either
case, questions the validity of any of the Operative Documents.

      4.12  LABOR DISPUTES AND ACTS OF GOD.

                                       40

<PAGE>

            Neither the business nor the properties of Borrower or, to
Borrower's knowledge, any other Major Project Participant are currently affected
by any fire, explosion, accident, strike, lockout or other labor dispute,
drought, storm, hail, earthquake, embargo, act of God or of the public enemy, or
other casualty (whether or not covered by insurance), which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      4.13  DISCLOSURE.

            None of this Agreement, the Bank Book nor any certificate or other
documentation (other than the Initial Operating Budget or the Base Case Project
Projections or other "forward-looking" statements) furnished to the Lead
Arranger, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, or the Lenders,
or to any consultant submitting a report to Administrative Agent, the Lead
Arranger or the Lenders, by or, to Borrower's knowledge, on behalf of Borrower
with respect to the Project, the Sponsor, the Pledgor, Borrower or any other
Calpine Entity or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the other Credit Documents or the description or operation of the
Project, taken as a whole, contained (at the time of delivery thereof) any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (at the time of delivery thereof)
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
herein or therein not misleading in any material respect under the circumstances
in which they were made at the time such statements were made (other than any
information that was corrected or updated in writing by Borrower or its
Affiliates or representatives to the Lead Arranger prior to the Closing Date).
There is no fact known to Borrower which has had or could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect which has not been disclosed in writing to
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or the
Lenders by or on behalf of Borrower on or prior to the Closing Date in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

      4.14  FLOOD ZONE DISCLOSURE.

            No material portion of the Site includes Improvements that are or
will be located in an area that has been identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as an area having special flood or mudslide hazards and in
which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance
Act of 1968, as amended.

      4.15  TAXES.

            (a) Borrower has timely filed, or caused to be filed, all federal,
state and local tax returns and reports that it is required to file, has paid
all material taxes, assessments, utility charges, fees and other governmental
charges it is required to pay to the extent due (other than those taxes that it
is contesting in good faith and by appropriate proceedings in accordance with
the requirements of Section 5.18). Borrower knows of no proposed tax assessment
against the Riverside Borrower, or Borrower which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than those proposed tax assessments
that Borrower is contesting in good faith and by appropriate proceedings in
accordance with the requirements of Section 5.18). In either case, to the extent
such taxes, assessments, charges and fees are not due, Borrower or the
applicable Calpine Entity has established reserves that are adequate for the
payment thereof in conformity with GAAP.

                                       41

<PAGE>

            (b) At all times since its formation, Borrower has been an entity
with a single owner that is disregarded as separate from its owner for federal
income tax purposes. No Form 8832 has ever been filed with respect to Borrower
as other than a disregarded entity and no such election shall have been made.

            (c) Borrower has no liability for the taxes of any Person (other
than Borrower) (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor,
(iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.

            (d) Borrower does not intend to treat the Term Loans (including the
incurrence thereof) as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4).

      4.16  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

            4.16.1 Borrower is not, and after giving effect to the borrowing of
any Term Loans or the issuance of the PSCo Letter of Credit will not be, subject
to regulation (a) under any provision of PUHCA except Section 32 thereof; or (b)
under any state law or regulation with respect to rates or the financial or
organizational regulation of electric utilities. Borrower is subject to
regulation as a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act, as amended
("FPA").

            4.16.2 The Project is an Eligible Facility within the meaning of
Section 32 of PUHCA, and Borrower has received a determination from the FERC
(not subject to any pending challenge, investigation, or proceeding) that it is
an "exempt wholesale generator" ("EWG"), within the meaning of Section 32 of
PUHCA. Borrower has validly issued orders from the FERC under the FPA, not
subject to any pending challenge, investigation, or proceeding, (a) authorizing
Borrower to engage in wholesale sales of electricity, ancillary services and, to
the extent permitted under its market-based rate tariff, other services at
market-based rates, and (b) granting such waivers and blanket authorizations
(including blanket authorization to issue securities and to assume liabilities
under Section 204 of the FPA and 18 C.F.R. Pt. 34), as are customarily granted
to entities with market-based rate authority. With respect to Borrower, the FERC
has not imposed any rate caps or mitigation measures other than rate caps and
mitigation measures generally applicable to similarly situated marketers or
generators selling electricity, ancillary services or other services at
wholesale in the geographic market where Borrower conducts its business.

            4.16.3 There are no pending complaints filed with the FERC seeking
abrogation or modification of a contract for the sale of power by the Borrower.

      4.17  REGULATION U, ETC.

            Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its principal
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of "buying",
"carrying" or "purchasing" margin stock (each as defined in Regulations T, U or
X of the Federal Reserve Board), and no part of the proceeds of the Term Loans,
the PSCo Letter of Credit or the Project Revenues will be used by Borrower for
the purpose of "buying", "carrying" or "purchasing" any such margin stock or for
any other purpose which violates the provisions of the regulations of the
Federal Reserve Board.

      4.18  INITIAL OPERATING BUDGET; PROJECTIONS.

            Borrower has prepared the Initial Operating Budget and the Base Case
Project Projections and is responsible for developing the assumptions on which
such Initial Operating Budget and the Base Case Project Projections are based;
and such Initial Operating Budget and the Base Case Project Projections (a) as
of the date delivered, updated or supplemented are based on Borrower's good
faith reasonable assumptions (including as to all legal and factual matters
material to the estimates set forth therein) and (b) as of the date delivered,
updated or supplemented are consistent in all material respects with the
provisions of the Project Documents executed on or prior to such date.

      4.19  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

            In the case of the financial statements of Borrower delivered
pursuant to Section 3.1.18 (other than the financial statements of Borrower
delivered pursuant to Section 3.1.18(c)), each such financial statement and
information has been prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly presents, in
all material respects, the financial position (on a consolidated and, where
applicable, consolidating basis) of Borrower described in such financial
statements as at the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows (on a consolidated and, where applicable, consolidating basis) of
Borrower described therein for each of the periods then ended, subject, in the
case of any such unaudited financial statements, to changes resulting from audit
and normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure. Except
for obligations under the Operative Documents to which it is a party, Borrower
does not (and will not following the funding of the initial Loans) have any
contingent obligations, unmatured liabilities, contingent liability or liability
for taxes, long-term lease or forward or long-term commitment required to be
shown under GAAP that is not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or
the notes thereto and which in any such case is material in relation to the
business, results of operations, properties, financial condition or prospects of
Borrower.

      4.20  NO DEFAULT.

            No Event of Default or Inchoate Default which has not been disclosed
to Administrative Agent in writing has occurred and is continuing.

      4.21  ORGANIZATIONAL ID NUMBER; LOCATION OF COLLATERAL.

            4.21.1 Borrower's organizational identification number is 3309088.

            4.21.2 All of the Collateral (other than the Accounts, the

or the Easements or at Borrower's address set forth in Section 11.1; provided
that certain equipment may be temporarily removed from the Site and/or Easements
from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

      4.22  TITLE AND LIENS.

            Borrower has (a) good, marketable and insurable (i) fee simple
interest in the Site and (ii) easement interest in the Easements (except that
title to certain of the Easements

                                       43

<PAGE>

which are licenses may not be insurable), and (b) good, legal and valid title to
all other Collateral, in each case free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens.

      4.23  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

            Except as disclosed in Exhibit G-5:

            (a) Borrower owns or possesses all licenses, permits, franchises,
authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names,
or rights thereto, that are necessary for the operation of its business, without
known conflict with the rights of others;

            (b) to the knowledge of Borrower, no product of Borrower infringes
in any material respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent,
copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other
Person;

            (c) to the knowledge of Borrower, there is no violation by any
Person of any right of Borrower with respect to any patent, copyright, service
mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by Borrower; and

            (d) to the knowledge of Borrower, there exists no pending or
threatened claim or litigation against or affecting Borrower contesting its
right to sell or use any such product, process, method, substance, part or other
material.

      4.24  COLLATERAL.

            The respective liens and security interests granted to Collateral
Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) pursuant to the Collateral
Documents (a) constitute as to personal property included in the Collateral a
valid security interest and (b) constitute as to the Mortgaged Property included
in the Collateral a valid lien and security interest in the Mortgaged Property,
in each case to the extent contemplated by the Collateral Documents. The
security interest granted to Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured
Parties) pursuant to the Collateral Documents in the Collateral consisting of
personal property will be perfected (i) with respect to any property that can be
perfected by filing, upon the filing of financing statements in the filing
offices identified in Exhibit D-6, (ii) with respect to any property that can be
perfected by control, upon execution of the Control Agreement and the Depositary
Agreement, and (iii) with respect to any property (if any) that can be perfected
by possession, upon Collateral Agent receiving possession thereof, and in each
case such security interest will be, as to Collateral perfected under the UCC or
otherwise as aforesaid, superior and prior to the rights of all third Persons
now existing or hereafter arising whether by way of mortgage, lien, security
interests, encumbrance, assignment or otherwise, except (i) Title Exceptions and
Permitted Liens described in clauses (a) and (e) of the definition of "Permitted
Liens," and (ii) to the extent required by Governmental Rule, those matters
described in clauses (b), (c) and (g) of the definition of "Permitted Liens."
Except to the extent possession of portions of the Collateral is required for
perfection, all such action as is necessary has been taken (or will be taken
immediately after the Closing Date) to establish and perfect Collateral Agent's
rights in and to the Collateral in existence on such date to the extent
Collateral Agent's security interest can be perfected by filing, including any

      5.14  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PROJECT; ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET.

            5.14.1 Keep the Project, or cause the same to be kept, in good
operating condition consistent in all material respects with the standard of
care set forth in the O&M Agreement, all Applicable Permits (and, if applicable,
Applicable Third Party Permits), Legal Requirements and the Operative Documents,
and make or cause to be made all repairs (structural and non-structural,
extraordinary or ordinary) necessary to keep the Project in such condition.

            5.14.2 Operate and maintain the Project, or cause the same to be
operated and maintained, in a manner consistent in all material respects with
Prudent Utility Practices and in compliance with the terms of the Power Purchase
Agreement.

            5.14.3 On the Closing Date and thereafter 60 days prior to the
beginning of each subsequent calendar year, submit an operating plan and a
budget, detailed by month, of anticipated revenues and anticipated expenditures
under all Waterfall Levels, and anticipated expenditures from the Major
Maintenance Reserve Account, such budget to include Debt Service, proposed
dividend distributions, Major Maintenance, reserves and all anticipated O&M
Costs (including reasonable allowance for contingencies) applicable to the
Project for the ensuing calendar year (or, in the case of the Initial Operating
Budget, partial calendar year) (each such annual operating plan and budget,
including the Initial Operating Budget, an "Annual Operating Budget"). Each
Annual Operating Budget (other than the Initial Operating Budget) shall be
deemed approved so long as the aggregate amount of anticipated O&M Costs remains
within 125% of the amount proposed to be expended by Borrower for all such items
during the applicable calendar year (as determined by reference to the
then-current Annual Operating Budget); it being acknowledged that the 125%
limitation shall not apply to any anticipated Variable O&M Costs to the extent
that such anticipated Variable O&M Costs result from the anticipated dispatch of
the Project at levels in excess of the levels contemplated by such Annual
Operating Budget. In the event that such Annual Operating Budget shall not be
deemed approved as provided in the preceding sentence, such Annual Operating
Budget shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Administrative Agent
acting in consultation with the Independent Engineer, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld. Failure by Administrative Agent to approve or disapprove
such draft Annual Operating Budget within 30 days after receipt thereof shall be
deemed to be an approval by Administrative Agent of such draft as the final
Annual Operating Budget. Borrower shall consider in good faith Administrative
Agent's suggestions in preparation of a final Annual Operating Budget (if not
deemed approved as provided above). Borrower shall prepare a final Annual
Operating Budget no less than 30 days in advance of the anticipated date of
commencement of each subsequent calendar year following the Closing Date. The
O&M Costs in each Annual Operating Budget which are subject to escalation
limitations in the Project Documents shall not, absent extraordinary
circumstances, be increased by more than the amounts provided in such Project
Documents.

                                       51

<PAGE>

            5.14.4 Borrower shall operate and maintain the Project, or cause the
Project to be operated and maintained, within amounts for all Operating Budget
Categories not to exceed 125% (on a year-to-date basis), in each case of the
amounts budgeted therefor as set forth in the then-current Annual Operating
Budget as approved or deemed approved by Administrative Agent; provided,
however, that (a) subject to Section 6.12, Borrower may propose an amendment to
the Annual Operating Budget for Administrative Agent's approval if at any time
Borrower cannot comply with the provisions of this Section 5.14.4 (and
Administrative Agent shall consider each such amendment in good faith and shall
not unreasonably withhold its consent to the approval of any such amendment),
(b) the 125% limitation shall not apply to Variable O&M Costs to the extent that
such Variable O&M Costs result from the dispatch of the Project at levels in
excess of the levels contemplated by the then-current Annual Operating Budget,
and (c) the 125% limitation shall not apply to Emergency Operating Costs to the
extent that, after deducting such Emergency Operating Costs from the applicable
calculation, Borrower otherwise remains in compliance with such 125% limitation.
Pending approval of any Annual Operating Budget or amendment thereto in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.14.4, Borrower shall use its best
efforts to operate and maintain the Project, or cause the Project to be operated
and maintained, within the then-current Annual Operating Budget (it being
acknowledged that if a particular calendar year's Annual Operating Budget has
not been approved by the time periods provided in Section 5.14.3, then the
then-current Annual Operating Budget shall be deemed to be the Annual Operating
Budget in effect prior to the delivery of the proposed final Annual Operating
Budget pursuant to Section 5.14.3); provided that the amounts specified therein
shall be increased to the extent specified in the Project Documents.

      5.15  PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

            5.15.1 Maintain in full force and effect, perform in all material

protect and defend the material rights of Borrower under and, take all
reasonable action necessary to prevent termination (except by expiration in
accordance with its terms) of each and every Major Project Document, including
(where Borrower in the exercise of its business judgment deems it proper)
prosecution of suits to enforce any material right of Borrower thereunder and
enforcement of any material claims with respect thereto; provided, however, that
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default if
Administrative Agent requests that certain actions be taken and Borrower fails
to take the requested actions within five Banking Days, Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent (as applicable) may enforce in its own name or in Borrower's
name, such rights of Borrower, all as more particularly provided in the Security
Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

            5.15.2 From time to time, execute, acknowledge, record, register,
deliver and/or file all such notices, statements, instruments and other

certificate), relating to the Term Loans stating the interest and charges then
due and any known Events of Default or Inchoate Defaults, and take such other
steps as may be necessary or advisable to render fully valid and enforceable
under all applicable laws the rights, liens and priorities of the Secured
Parties with respect to all Collateral and other security from time to time
furnished under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents or intended to be
so furnished, in each case in such form and at such times as shall be reasonably
requested by Collateral Agent,

                                       52

incident to compliance with this Section 5.15.2.

            5.15.3 If Borrower shall at any time acquire any real property or
leasehold or other interest in real property not covered by the Mortgage, then
promptly upon such acquisition, execute, deliver and record a supplement to the
Mortgage, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Administrative Agent,
subjecting the real property or leasehold or other interests to the Lien and
security interest created by the Mortgage. If reasonably requested by
Administrative Agent, Borrower shall obtain an appropriate endorsement or
supplement to the Title Policy insuring the Lien of the Secured Parties in such
additional property, subject only to Permitted Liens and other exceptions to
title approved by Administrative Agent.

            5.15.4 Upon the request of Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent,
execute and deliver all documents as shall be necessary or that Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) shall reasonably request in
connection with the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be) and the Lenders under the Operative Documents, and
perform, such other reasonable acts as may be necessary to carry out the intent
of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including any such acts
necessary to implement a Required HoldCo Transfer).

            5.15.5 Take such action, including the execution and filing of all
such documents and instruments, as may be necessary to effect and continue the
appointment of Corporation Service Company as its agent for service of process
in full force and effect, or if necessary by reason of any fact or condition
relating to such agent, to replace such agent (but only after having given
notice and evidence thereof to Administrative Agent).

6.15 or Article 7, in each case cause the applicable counterparty or Replacement
Obligor, as applicable, to execute and deliver to Administrative Agent a Consent
in substantially the form of Exhibit E-1, with such changes as are reasonably
acceptable to Administrative Agent.

      5.17  MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE.

            Without cost to the Secured Parties, maintain or cause to be
maintained on its behalf in effect at all times the types of insurance required
pursuant to Exhibit K, in the amounts and on the terms and conditions specified
therein, from the quality of insurers specified in such Exhibit or other
insurance companies of recognized responsibility reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent.

      5.18  TAXES, OTHER GOVERNMENT CHARGES AND UTILITY CHARGES.

            Subject to the second sentence of this Section 5.18, timely file all
material tax returns and pay, or cause to be paid, as and when due and prior to
delinquency, all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges of any
kind that may at any time be lawfully assessed or

levied against or with respect to Borrower or the Project, including sales and
use taxes and real estate taxes, all utility and other charges incurred in the
operation, maintenance, use, occupancy and upkeep of the Project, and all
assessments and charges lawfully made by any Governmental Authority for public
improvements that may be secured by a Lien on the Project. Borrower may contest
in good faith any such taxes, assessments and other charges and, in such event,
may permit the taxes, assessments or other charges so contested to remain unpaid
during any period, including appeals, when Borrower is in good faith contesting
the same, so long as (a) reserves to the extent required by GAAP have been

charges, accrued interest thereon and potential penalties or other costs
relating thereto, or other adequate provision for the payment thereof shall have
been made and maintained at all times during such contest, (b) enforcement of
the contested tax, assessment or other charge is effectively stayed for the
entire duration of such contest, and (c) any tax, assessment or other charge
determined to be due, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is

            5.20.3 Security. Each Interest Rate Agreement provided by a Lender

thereunder, entered into in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and all
Hedge Breaking Fees shall be and are hereby secured by any Collateral Documents,
pari passu with the Term Loans. The parties hereto agree that, for purposes of

such Hedge Lender shall be deemed a Lender under the Collateral Documents to the
extent of such Term Loan.

no longer meets the criteria of an EWG or takes other action revoking such EWG

intended to be created thereby or, except in accordance with its terms, cease to
be in full force and effect, or the first priority or validity thereof or the
applicability thereof to the Term Loans, the Notes (if any) or any other
obligations purported to be secured or guaranteed thereby or any part thereof

Document shall be declared null and void by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction.

            7.1.14 Misstatements; Omissions. Any representation or warranty made

            (a) Borrower. Borrower shall be in breach of, or in default under, a
Major Project Document which breach or default if not cured could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and such breach or default shall not
be remediable or, if remediable, shall continue unremedied for the lesser of (i)
the greater of (A) a period of 30 days; provided that if (1) such breach cannot
be cured within such 30 day period (or such lesser period of time, as the case

or

                                       65

default, and (3) Borrower is proceeding with diligence and in good faith to cure
such breach, then such 30 day cure period (or such lesser period of time, as the

Project Document which Borrower has available to it in which to remedy such
breach or default.

            (b) Third Party. Any Person other than Borrower shall be in breach
of, or in default under, a Major Project Document which breach or default if not
cured could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and such
breach or default shall not be remediable or, if remediable, shall continue
unremedied for a period of 30 days from the time Borrower obtains knowledge of
such breach; provided that if (i) such breach cannot be cured within such 30 day
period, (ii) such breach or default is susceptible of cure within 90 days, and
(iii) the breaching Person or Borrower is proceeding with diligence and in good

breaching Person diligently to cure such breach; provided, further, that no
Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such action if Borrower obtains
a Replacement Obligor for the affected party within the 90 day cure period
referred to in this paragraph (or within the 30 day cure period, if no extension
is given) and such action does not have prior to so obtaining such Replacement
Obligor a Borrower Material Adverse Effect.

such Person within 60 days thereof, (ii) any representation or warranty made by
any Person other than Borrower in a Consent shall be untrue or misleading in any
material respect as of the time made and such untrue or misleading
representation or warranty could reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the rights of the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties thereunder or
to otherwise result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) a Person other than

total of 90 days, as shall be necessary for such third party diligently to cure
such breach; provided, further, that no Event of Default shall occur as a result
of any such action if Borrower obtains a Replacement Obligor for the affected
party with respect to the contract or contracts to which such Consent relates,
within the 90 day cure period referred to in this paragraph (or within the 30
day cure period, if no extension is given) and such action does not have prior
to so obtaining such Replacement Obligor a Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) Termination. A Major Project Document shall terminate on or
before its scheduled expiration date except upon fulfillment of such party's
obligations thereunder, or shall

                                       66

<PAGE>

be declared null and void; provided that no Event of Default shall occur as a
result of such breach or default if Borrower obtains a Replacement Obligor for
the affected party within 90 days thereafter and such breach or default has not
had and does not have prior to so obtaining such Replacement Obligor, a Material
Adverse Effect.

            Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, and the Lenders may, at the
election of the Majority Lenders, without further notice of default, presentment
or demand for payment, protest or notice of non-payment or dishonor, or other
notices or demands of any kind, all such notices and demands (other than notices
required by the Credit Documents) being waived, exercise any or all of the
following rights and remedies, in any combination or order that the Majority
Lenders may elect, in addition to such other rights or remedies as the Secured
Parties may have hereunder, under the Collateral Documents or at law or in
equity:

            7.2.1 No Further Term Loans. Cancel the Total Term Loan Commitment,
refuse, and Administrative Agent, and the Lenders shall not be obligated, to
continue any Term Loans, or make any payments, or permit the making of payments,
from any Account or any Loss Proceeds or other funds held by Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent under the Credit Documents or on behalf of Borrower;
provided that in the case of an Event of Default occurring under Section 7.1.2
with respect to Borrower, the Total Term Loan Commitment shall be cancelled and
terminated without further act of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, or any
Secured Party.

            7.2.2 Cure by Agents. Without any obligation to do so, make
disbursements to or on behalf of Borrower or disburse amounts from the Accounts

Lenders in their sole discretion may consider necessary or appropriate, whether
to preserve and protect the Collateral or the Secured Parties' interests therein
or for any other reason. All sums so expended, together with interest on such
total amount at the Default Rate (but in no event shall the rate exceed the
maximum lawful rate), shall be repaid by Borrower to Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, on demand and shall be secured by the
Credit Documents, notwithstanding that such expenditures may, together with
amounts advanced under this Agreement, exceed the aggregate amount of the Total
Term Loan Commitment.

            7.2.3 Acceleration. Declare and make all or a portion of the sums of
accrued and outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest remaining
under this Agreement, together with all unpaid fees, costs (including
Liquidation Costs and Hedge Breaking Fees) and charges due hereunder or under
any other Credit Document, immediately due and payable and require Borrower
immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of

                                       67

<PAGE>

which Borrower hereby expressly waives, to pay Administrative Agent or the
Secured Parties an amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate
amount of any outstanding Obligations; provided that, in the event of an Event
of Default occurring under Section 7.1.2 with respect to Borrower, all such
amounts shall become immediately due and payable without further act of
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, or the Secured Parties.

            7.2.4 Cash Collateral. Apply or execute upon any amounts on deposit
in any Account or any Loss Proceeds or any other moneys of Borrower on deposit
with Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent or any Secured
Party in the manner provided in the UCC and other relevant statutes and
decisions and interpretations thereunder with respect to cash collateral.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent
and Depositary Agent shall have all rights and powers with respect to Loss
Proceeds, the Accounts and the contents of the Accounts as it has with respect
to any other Collateral and may apply, or cause the application of, such amounts
to the payment of interest, principal, fees, costs, charges or other amounts due
or payable to Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, Depositary
Agent or the Secured Parties with respect to the Term Loans or as otherwise
provided in the Depositary Agreement in such order as the Majority Lenders may
elect in their sole discretion. Until such time as the Majority Lenders so elect
to exercise such rights and powers, amounts in the Revenue Account shall be
applied as provided in the Depositary Agreement. Borrower shall not have any
rights or powers with respect to such amounts except as expressly provided in
this Section 7.2.4.

            7.2.5 Possession of Project. Enter into possession of the Project
and perform any and all work and labor necessary to operate and maintain the
Project, and all sums expended by Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or
Depositary Agent in so doing, together with interest on such total amount at the
Default Rate, shall be repaid by Borrower to Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent or Depositary Agent, as the case may be, upon demand and shall be secured
by the Credit Documents, notwithstanding that such expenditures may, together
with amounts advanced under this Agreement, exceed the aggregate amount of the
Total Term Loan Commitment.

            7.2.6 Remedies Under Credit Documents. Exercise, and direct
Administrative Agent, Depositary Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be)
to exercise, any and all rights and remedies available to it under any of the
Credit Documents, including judicial or non-judicial foreclosure or public or
private sale of any of the Collateral pursuant to the Collateral Documents.

            7.2.7 Cash Collateralization of PSCo Letter of Credit. Maintain in
an account under the exclusive dominion and control of Administrative Agent for
the payment of any Funded LC Disbursement and interest thereon and fees related
thereto an amount of cash equal to the greater of such amount and 110% of the
stated amount of the PSCo Letter of Credit. If and to the extent the PSCo Letter
of Credit is cash collateralized to the extent provided in this Section 7.2.7,
Issuing Bank shall release from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, and return to
each Lender such Lender's Proportionate Share of, Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposits in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the PSCo Letter of Credit
so cash collateralized.

payee and in form satisfactory to Administrative Agent; (b) each of

of Borrower or any other Person or to ascertain or determine whether a Material
Adverse Effect exists or is continuing; and (e) none of Collateral Agent,
Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank and Lead Arranger shall be responsible to any
Secured Party for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of any Operative Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto. Except as otherwise provided
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, each of Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank shall take such action with respect to
the Credit Documents as shall be directed by the Majority Lenders.

applicable to all Secured Parties and those set forth in this Article 9. The
Syndication Agent shall have no right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement, other than those applicable to all
Secured Parties and those set forth in this Article 9. Lead Arranger shall only
have those rights, powers, obligations, liabilities, responsibilities and duties
set forth in Section 3.1 and this Article 9. Without limiting the foregoing,
none of Lead Arranger, Syndication Agent and the Book Runner shall have or be
deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Secured Party. Each Secured
Party hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to Lead Arranger,
Syndication Agent and the Book Runner as it makes with respect to the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in this Article 9. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that the Book Runner and the

additional rights or obligations relative to those conferred on any Secured
Party hereunder.

      9.2   RELIANCE.

            Each of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank
shall be entitled to rely upon any certificate, notice or other document
(including any cable, telegram, facsimile, electronic mail or telex) believed by
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of
the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by it. As to any other
matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, none of Collateral Agent,
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank shall be required to take any action or
exercise any discretion, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting
upon instructions of the Majority Lenders or, where expressly provided, the
Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders (except that none of Collateral Agent,
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank shall be required to take any action which
exposes Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may
be) to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, any other
Credit Document or any Legal Requirement). Each of Collateral Agent,
Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank shall in all cases (including when any
action by Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case
may be) alone is authorized hereunder, if Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent
or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) elects in its sole discretion to obtain
instructions from the Majority Lenders) be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, hereunder or under any other Credit Document in
accordance with the instructions of the Majority Lenders (or, where so expressly
stated, the Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders), and such instructions of the
Majority Lenders (or Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders, where applicable) and
any action taken or failure to act

                                       71

<PAGE>

pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Secured Parties. In addition,
for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section
3.1, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have
consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter either sent by Administrative Agent to such Lender for consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to
or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to Lender.

      9.3   NON-RELIANCE.

            Each Lender represents that it has, independently and without
reliance on Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of the financial condition and
affairs of the Calpine Entities and its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon Lead
Arranger, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own appraisals and decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Agreement. Each of Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger,
Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and any Lender shall not be required to keep
informed as to the performance or observance by any Calpine Entity or its
Affiliates under this Agreement or any other document referred to or provided
for herein or to make inquiry of, or to inspect the properties or books of any
Calpine Entity or its Affiliates.

      9.4   DEFAULTS; MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

            None of Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Inchoate Default, Event of Default or Material Adverse Effect,
unless such Person has received a notice from a Lender or Borrower, referring to
this Agreement, describing such Inchoate Default, Event of Default or Material
Adverse Effect and indicating that such notice is a notice of the occurrence of
such default or Material Adverse Effect (as the case may be). If Administrative
Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of an Inchoate Default, Event of
Default or Material Adverse Effect, Administrative Agent shall give notice
thereof to the Lenders. Each of Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent shall
take such action with respect to such Inchoate Default, Event of Default or
Material Adverse Effect as is provided in Article 3, Article 7 or the terms of
the Credit Documents, or if not provided for in Article 3, Article 7 or such
Credit Documents, as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall be
reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders; provided, however, that unless and
until Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall have received such
directions, each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may (but shall not
be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Inchoate Default, Event of Default or Material Adverse Effect as
it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

      9.5   SUCCESSOR AGENT & ISSUING BANK.

            Each of Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank may
resign at any time by giving fifteen days' written notice thereof to the Secured
Parties and Borrower; provided that the resigning Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent may only resign hereunder if such Person

                                       72
<PAGE>

also resigns in such capacity under the Riverside Credit Agreement. Each of
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank may be removed
involuntarily only for a material breach of its respective duties and
obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents or for gross
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the performance of its
respective duties hereunder or under the other Credit Documents and then only
upon the affirmative vote of the Majority Lenders (excluding Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank (as the case may be) from such vote and
Administrative Agent's, Collateral Agent's and Issuing Bank's (as the case may
be) Proportionate Share (if any) of the Total Term Loan Commitment and Term
Loans from the amounts used to determine the portion of the Total Term Loan
Commitment and Term Loans necessary to constitute the required Proportionate
Share of the remaining Lenders); provided that the removed Administrative Agent
or Collateral Agent may only be removed hereunder if such Person also is removed
in such capacity under the Riverside Credit Agreement. Upon any such resignation
or removal of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank, the
Majority Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be)
under this Agreement and, with respect to Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent, under the Riverside Credit Agreement. If no successor Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) shall have been so
appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's, Collateral Agent's or
Issuing Bank's (as the case may be) giving of notice of resignation or the
Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or
Issuing Bank (as the case may be), the retiring Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) may, on behalf of the Secured
Parties, with the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), appoint a successor Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent
or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) hereunder and, with respect to
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, under the Riverside Credit Agreement.
Such successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be)
shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall
be a commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000. Such successor Issuing Bank shall be a commercial bank having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 and a rating by S&P on its
long-term senior unsecured indebtedness of at least A-. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as
the case may be) under the Operative Documents and, with respect to
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, the Riverside Operative Documents by a
successor Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case
may be), such successor Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank
(as the case may be) shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be), and the retiring
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be)
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) only under the Credit
Documents and, with respect to Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, the
Riverside Credit Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's,
Collateral Agent's or Issuing Bank's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank (as the case may be), the
provisions of this Article 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be) under the Operative Documents.

                                       73
<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Issuing Bank's resignation or removal under this
Agreement shall not be effective until a successor financial institution becomes
the "Issuing Bank" hereunder. On the date any successor financial institution
becomes "Issuing Bank" hereunder, such successor Issuing Bank shall issue to
PSCo a replacement PSCo Letter of Credit. On the date any successor financial
institution becomes "Administrative Agent" hereunder, the Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposits will be transferred to the successor Administrative
Agent.

      9.6   AUTHORIZATION.

            Each of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank is
hereby authorized by the Secured Parties to execute, deliver and perform each of
the Credit Documents to which Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or Issuing
Bank (as the case may be) is or is intended to be a party, and each Lender
agrees to be bound by all of the agreements of Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent and Issuing Bank contained in the Credit Documents. Each of Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank (as the case may be) is further
authorized by the Secured Parties to (a) release Liens on property that Borrower
is permitted to sell, transfer or otherwise release pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, (b) to enter into on behalf of
such Secured Parties any and all amendments to, or other modifications of, this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents necessary to effectuate any Required
HoldCo Transfer, (c) perform all of its obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement and (d) to enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose
of curing any formal defect, inconsistency, omission or ambiguity in this
Agreement or any Credit Document to which it is a party.

      9.7   OTHER ROLES.

            With respect to its Total Term Loan Commitment, the Term Loans made
by it and any Note issued to it, each of Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent,
Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent in its individual capacity shall have the
same rights and powers under the Operative Documents as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent or
Administrative Agent. The term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include each of Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent, Issuing
Bank and Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. Each of Lead Arranger,
Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and Administrative Agent and their respective
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any
other Person, without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. For the
avoidance of doubt, Credit Suisse First Boston, acting through its Cayman
Islands Branch (or any permitted successor or assign) may act as Administrative
Agent, Riverside Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, Riverside
Collateral Agent, Lead Arranger, Book Runner and Riverside Lead Arranger
notwithstanding any potential or actual conflict of interest presented by the
foregoing and Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby waives any claim against
each of Lead Arranger, Book Runner, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and
Administrative Agent and any of their respective Affiliates based upon any
conflict of interest that such Person may have with regard to acting as an agent
or arranger hereunder and acting in such other roles.

<PAGE>

shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute
amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of such Lender. Any
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the

the Related Funds of a Lender shall exercise its rights in a manner consistent
and collectively with such Lender and each other Related Fund of such Lender.

      9.9   WITHHOLDING TAX.

            If the forms or other documentation required by Section 2.3.4(e) are
not delivered to Administrative Agent, then Administrative Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to any Lender not providing such forms or other
documentation, an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

            9.9.1 If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Administrative Agent did not
properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
(because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or
because such Lender failed to notify Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective, or for any other reason), then such Lender shall indemnify
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by
Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff
costs, and any out of pocket expenses. Borrower shall not be responsible for any
amounts paid or required to be paid by a Lender under this Section 9.9.1.

            9.9.2 If any Lender sells, assigns, grants participation in, or
otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement, the purchaser, assignee,
participant or transferee, as applicable,

                                       76
<PAGE>

shall comply and be bound by the terms of Section 2.3.4 and this Section 9.9 as
though it were such Lender.

      9.10  GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO PAYMENTS.

            Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender,
subject to Section 2.1.10(d) and any accepted Mandatory Repayment Offer whereby

rights under this Section 9.1.11 and including the negotiation of any

connection with the enforcement of any Obligations of Borrower after an Event of
Default or in connection with any insolvency proceedings.

            9.11.2 Borrower shall indemnify each of Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, Lead Arranger, Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an

party losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of (a) the execution or delivery of any Credit Document or
any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
to the Credit Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the
consummation of the Term Loans or any other transactions contemplated thereby
or, with respect to Lead Arranger or any Related Party of Lead Arranger, in
connection with the arrangement and syndication of the credit facilities
provided for herein, (b) any Term Loan or PSCo Letter of Credit or the use of

investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on

party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnitee.

            9.11.3 To the extent that Borrower fails to pay any amount required

claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against such Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or
Lead Arranger in its capacity as such.

            9.11.4 All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of Issuing Bank that issues

transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder other than in accordance
with Section 6.15 without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by Borrower without such consent shall be null
and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied; shall be construed
to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of Issuing Bank
that issues the PSCo Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent,
Lead Arranger, Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            9.12.2 Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Term Loan Commitment, Term Loans at the time owing to it and
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits); provided that: (a) Administrative Agent must
give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld); (b) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Eligible Assignee, Borrower must provide its prior written consent to such
assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); (c) such Lender
shall at the same time assign a pro rata portion of its "Total Term Commitment"
and "Term Loans" under the Riverside Credit Agreement to the same assignee; (d)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Eligible Assignee or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's "Total Term
Commitment," "Term Loans," "Funded LC Disbursements" and "Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit" under this Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the
Riverside Credit Agreement, the aggregate amount of the Term Loan Commitments,
Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit of the
assigning Lender under this Agreement subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent) shall be in an aggregate amount
of not less than $1,000,000 unless each of Borrower and Administrative Agent
otherwise consent; (e) each partial assignment by a Lender of its Commitments,
Term Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit shall be
made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Commitment, Term
Loans, Funded LC Disbursements and Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit; (f) the
parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance (such Assignment and Acceptance to be (i)
electronically executed and delivered to Administrative Agent via an electronic
settlement system then acceptable to Administrative Agent, which shall initially
be the settlement system of ClearPar, LLC, or (ii) manually executed and
delivered with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500); and (g) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that any consent of Borrower
otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required (x) if an Event of
Default under this Agreement shall have occurred and is continuing or (y) in
connection with the initial syndication of the Commitments, Term Loans and
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to Section 9.12.4, from and after the effective date specified in

                                       79
<PAGE>

each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement other than as
set forth in Section 2.5.5, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.3.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 9.12). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this Section 9.12.2 shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with Section 9.12.5. Without the consent of
Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit of
any Lender shall not be released in connection with any assignment by such
Lender, but shall instead be purchased by the relevant assignee and continue to
be held for application (to the extent not already applied) in accordance with
Section 2.8.2 to satisfy such assignee's obligations in respect of Funded LC
Disbursements.

            9.12.3 Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of

setting forth: (a) the Commitments and the Term Loans and Funded LC
Disbursements from time to time of each Lender; (b) the interest rates
applicable to all Term Loans and the effective dates of all changes thereto; (c)
the Interest Period for each LIBOR Term Loan; (d) the date and amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower
to each Lender hereunder; (e) each repayment or prepayment in respect of the
principal amount of the Term Loans of each Lender; (f) the amount of any sum
received by Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and
each Lender's share thereof; (g) the names and addresses of the Lenders, and (h)
such other information as Administrative Agent may determine is necessary for
the administering of the Term Loans, the Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposits and
this Agreement. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Borrower,
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            9.12.4 Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee, if any, referred to in
Section 9.12.2 and any written consent to such assignment required by such
Section 9.12.2, Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance
and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this Section 9.12.4. Upon any transfer by a Lender
of all or part of its Term Loan Commitment or Term Loans, Exhibit H shall be
automatically updated without any further act by any Person to reflect the
Lenders' Proportionate Shares after giving effect to such transfer.

            9.12.5 Any Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a

                                       80
<PAGE>

portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitments and Term Loans owing to it and its Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit); provided that (a) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (b) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(c) Borrower, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and (d) such Lender shall
at the same time sell a participation in a pro rata portion of its "Total Term
Commitment" and "Term Loans" under the Riverside Credit Agreement to the same
Participant. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
other Credit Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (g)
of Section 9.8.2. Subject to Section 9.12.6, Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.3.4, 2.5 and 2.6 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to Section 9.12.2. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as though it
were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.4.1
as though it were a Lender.

            9.12.6 A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.3.4, 2.5 or 2.6 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant. A Participant that would be a non-United States "Lender" under
Section 2.3.4(e) if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.3 unless Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply
with Section 2.3.4(e) as though it were a Lender.

            9.12.7 Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto; provided, further, that the pledgor shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
other Credit Documents. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in
bank loans, such Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or Administrative
Agent, assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement,
including the Term Loans and Notes or any other instrument evidencing its rights
as a Lender under this Agreement, to any holder of, trustee for, or any other
representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued, by such
fund, as security for such obligations or securities; provided that any
foreclosure or similar action by such trustee or representative shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 9.12.2 concerning assignments.

            9.12.8 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
(an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting
Lender to Administrative Agent and Borrower, the option to provide to Borrower
all or any part of any Term Loans or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit that such
Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement; provided that (a) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment
by any SPC to make any Term Loan or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit and (b) if
an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or
any part of such Term Loan or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit, the Granting
Lender shall be obligated to make such Term Loan or Funded LC Credit-Linked
Deposit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The making of a Term Loan or
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit by an SPC shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Term Loan or Funded LC
Credit-Linked Deposit were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto
hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment
obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the
Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement ) that,
prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will
not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC
in connection with its activities as an SPC hereunder any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the
laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 9.12, any SPC may with notice to, but
without the prior written consent of, Borrower and Administrative Agent and
without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its
interests in any Term Loans or Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit to the Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by Borrower and
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Term Loans or
Funded LC Credit-Linked Deposit. The provisions of this Section 9.12.8 relating
any SPC may not be amended without the written consent of such SPC.

      9.13  LAWS.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 9, no sale,
assignment, transfer, negotiation or other disposition of the interests of any
Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents shall be allowed if it
would require registration under the federal Securities Act of 1933, as then
amended, any other federal securities laws or regulations or the securities laws
or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. Borrower shall, from time to time
at the request and expense of Administrative Agent, execute and deliver to
Administrative Agent, or to such party or parties as Administrative Agent may
designate, any and all further instruments as may in the opinion of
Administrative Agent be reasonably necessary or advisable to give full force and
effect to such sale, assignment, transfer, negotiation or disposition which
would not require any such registration.

<PAGE>

            Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Majority
Lenders) may remove from time to time, any one or more of the Independent
Consultants and, after consulting with Borrower as to an appropriate Person,
appoint replacements as Administrative Agent may choose. Notice of any
replacement Independent Consultant shall be given by Administrative Agent to
Borrower, the Lenders and to the Independent Consultant being replaced. All
reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Consultants (whether the
original ones or replacements) shall be paid by Borrower pursuant to agreements
reasonably acceptable to Borrower; provided that no such acceptance shall be
required at any time an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

      10.2  DUTIES.

            Each Independent Consultant shall be contractually obligated to
Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) to carry out the activities
required of it in this Agreement and as otherwise requested by Administrative
Agent and shall be responsible solely to Administrative Agent. Borrower
acknowledges that it will not have any cause of action or claim against any
Independent Consultant resulting from any decision made or not made, any action
taken or not taken or any advice given by such Independent Consultant in the due
performance in good faith of its duties to Administrative Agent, except to the
extent arising from such Independent Consultant's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

      10.3  INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS' CERTIFICATES.

            Up to and following the Closing Date, Borrower shall provide such
documents and information to the Independent Consultants as they may reasonably
consider necessary in order for the Independent Consultants to deliver to
Administrative Agent the following certificates or information:

            (a) certificates of the Insurance Consultant, Independent Engineer
and Power Market Consultant delivered on and dated as of the Closing Date as
described in Sections 3.1.9, 3.1.11 and 3.1.13, respectively, and containing the
matters set out therein;

            (b) after the Closing Date, all certificates to be delivered
thereafter pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents;

            (c) annually, a certificate setting forth a full report on the
status of the Project and such other information; and

            (d) such other information and certifications as Administrative
Agent may reasonably require from the Independent Consultants from time to time.

      10.4  CERTIFICATION OF DATES.

            Administrative Agent will request that the Independent Consultants
act diligently in the issuance of all certificates required to be delivered by
the Independent Consultants hereunder, if their issuance is appropriate.
Borrower shall provide the Independent Consultants with reasonable notice of the
expected occurrence of any such dates or events.

            Any deposits or other sums at any time credited or due from Lenders

possession of any Secured Party may at all times be treated as collateral
security for the payment of the Term Loans, any Notes and any Funded LC
Disbursements and all other obligations of Borrower to the Lenders under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and Borrower hereby pledges to
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and grants Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties a security interest in and to all
such deposits, sums, securities or other property. Subject to Section 2.4.2,
regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral, any Secured Party with the
prior written consent of the Collateral Agent may execute or realize on its or

to the Secured Parties upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Inchoate
Default, Material Adverse Effect or any breach or default of Borrower or any
other Calpine Entity or unsatisfied condition precedent under this Agreement or
any other Credit Document shall impair any such right, power or remedy of the
Secured Parties, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or
default or unsatisfied condition precedent, or an acquiescence therein, or of or
in any similar breach or default or unsatisfied condition precedent thereafter
occurring, nor shall any waiver of any single Event of Default, Inchoate
Default, Material Adverse Effect or other breach or default or unsatisfied
condition precedent be deemed a waiver of any other Event of Default, Inchoate
Default, Material Adverse Effect or other breach or default or unsatisfied
condition precedent theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit,
consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank or the Secured Parties of any Event of
Default, Inchoate Default, Material Adverse Effect or other breach or default or
unsatisfied condition precedent under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, or any waiver on the part of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent,

effective only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or any other Credit Document or by law or
otherwise

                                       85
<PAGE>

afforded to Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank and the Secured
Parties, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

      11.4  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

            This Agreement and any agreement, document or instrument attached
hereto or referred to herein integrate all the terms and conditions mentioned
herein or incidental hereto and supersede all oral negotiations and prior
writings in respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict
between the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement and any such

Agreement shall prevail.

      11.5  GOVERNING LAW.

            THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT (UNLESS OTHERWISE
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR THEREIN), SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED UNDER, THE

THAN SECTION 5-1401 AND SECTION 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW).

      11.6  SEVERABILITY.

            In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby.

      11.7  HEADINGS.

            Article, Section and Paragraph headings have been inserted in this

<PAGE>

            The Lenders and Borrower intend that the relationship between them
shall be solely that of creditor and debtor. Nothing contained in this
Agreement, the Notes or in any of the other Credit Documents shall be deemed or
construed to create a partnership, tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy, joint
venture or co-ownership by or between the Lenders and Borrower or any other
Person. None of Lead Arranger, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing
Bank or the Lenders shall be in any way responsible or liable for the debts,
losses, obligations or duties of Borrower or any other Person with respect to
the Project or otherwise. All obligations to pay real property or other taxes,
assessments, insurance premiums, and all other fees and charges arising from the
ownership, operation or occupancy of the Project (if any) and to perform all
obligations and other agreements and contracts relating to the Project shall be
the sole responsibility of Borrower.

      11.11 MORTGAGE/COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS.

            The Obligations of Borrower hereunder are secured in part by the
Mortgage encumbering certain properties in the State of Colorado. Reference is
hereby made to the Mortgage and the other Collateral Documents for the
provisions, among others, relating to the nature and extent of the security
provided thereunder, the rights, duties and obligations of Borrower and the
rights of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties
with respect to such security.

      11.12 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.

            No claim shall be made by Borrower against Lead Arranger,
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, the Lenders or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors, employees, attorneys or agents for any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings, special or punitive damages or
any indirect or consequential loss whatsoever in respect of any breach or
wrongful conduct (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort
or duty imposed by law), in connection with, arising out of or in any way
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Operative Documents or any act or omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, and Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any
such claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known
or suspected to exist in its favor.

      11.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

            ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, COLLATERAL AGENT, ISSUING BANK, THE LENDERS
AND BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS
THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER
VERBAL OR WRITTEN), OR ACTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, COLLATERAL AGENT,
ISSUING BANK, THE LENDERS OR BORROWER. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT
FOR BORROWER, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, COLLATERAL AGENT, ISSUING BANK AND THE
LENDERS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

                                       87
<PAGE>

      11.14 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.

            Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, the Lenders
and Borrower agree that any legal action or proceeding by or against Borrower or
with respect to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes, or any other Credit
Document may be brought in or removed to the courts of the State of New York, in
and for the County of New York, or of the United States of America for the
Southern District of New York, as Administrative Agent may elect. By execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Lenders, Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent, Issuing Bank and Borrower accept, for themselves and in respect of their
property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, the Lenders and
Borrower irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any manner permitted by law. Nothing herein shall
affect the right of Administrative Agent to bring legal action or proceedings in
any other competent jurisdiction, including judicial or non-judicial foreclosure
of the Mortgage. Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Issuing Bank, the
Lenders and Borrower further agree that the aforesaid courts of the State of New
York and of the United States of America shall have exclusive jurisdiction with
respect to any claim or counterclaim of Borrower based upon the assertion that
the rate of interest charged by the Lenders on or under this Agreement, the Term
Loans or the other Credit Documents is usurious. Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, the Lenders, Issuing Bank, and Borrower hereby waive any right
to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding under or in connection with any or
all of the Project, this Agreement or any other Credit Document brought before
the foregoing courts on the basis of forum non-conveniens.

      11.15 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTRIBUTION.

"knowledge," "best knowledge" or facts and circumstances "known to" Borrower,
and all like references, mean facts or circumstances of which a Responsible
Officer of the applicable Calpine Entity has actual knowledge.

      11.16 COUNTERPARTS.

            This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements
hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in one or more duplicate
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument;
signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached
to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to
the same document.

      11.17 USURY.

            Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Notes shall be deemed to
require the payment of interest or other charges by Borrower or any other Person
in excess of the amount which the holders of the Notes may lawfully charge under
applicable usury laws. In the event that the Lenders shall collect moneys which
are deemed to constitute interest which would

                                       88
<PAGE>

increase the effective interest rate to a rate in excess of that permitted to be
charged by applicable Legal Requirements, all such sums deemed to constitute
interest in excess of the legal rate shall, upon such determination, at the
option of the Lenders, be returned to Borrower or credited against the principal
balance then outstanding.

      11.18 SURVIVAL.

            All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made
herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with
or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be considered
to have been relied upon by the parties hereto and shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and the making of the
Term Loans and the issuance of the PSCo Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements and
covenants of Borrower set forth in Articles 5, 6 and 7 shall survive through the
Termination Date, the agreements of Borrower set forth in Sections 2.1.4(b),
2.1.6, 2.1.10, 2.2, 2.3.4, 2.5.3, 2.5.4, 2.6, 2.8.2, 9.1, 9.7, 9.11 and 9.12,
and the agreements of the Lenders set forth in Sections 2.8.2, 9.1, 9.5 and 9.9
shall survive the payment and performance of the Term Loans, the expiration or
termination of the PSCo Letter of Credit and the other Obligations and the
reimbursement of any amounts drawn hereunder, and the Termination Date.

      11.19 INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.

            EACH LENDER AND EACH OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, COLLATERAL AGENT AND
ISSUING BANK HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE LIEN
PRIORITIES AND OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE COLLATERAL
ARE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT. Each Lender and each
of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank, by delivering its
signature page hereto, funding its Term Loan on the Closing Date and/or
executing an Assignment and Acceptance (as the case may be), shall be deemed to
have (a) acknowledged receipt of, consented to and approved the Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) authorized Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to
perform their respective obligations thereunder.

      11.20 CONFIDENTIALITY.

            Each Lender shall hold all non-public information regarding Borrower
and its business identified as such by Borrower and obtained by such Lender
pursuant to the requirements hereof in accordance with such Lender's customary
procedures for handling confidential information of such nature, it being
understood and agreed by Borrower that, in any event, a Lender may make:

keep such information confidential in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 11.20;

                                       89

fide or potential assignee, transferee or participant in connection with the
contemplated assignment, transfer or participation by such Lender of any its
interests herein (including any of its Term Loans) or any participations
therein; provided that such assignees, transferees or participants agree to keep
such information confidential in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 11.20;

            (c) disclosure to any rating agency when required by it; provided
that, prior to any disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake in writing to
