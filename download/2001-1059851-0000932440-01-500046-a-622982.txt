activities  in which it is presently  engaged and is duly  qualified and in good

reorganization,  moratorium or other similar laws (whether statutory, regulatory


                                     6
<PAGE>



or  decisional)  now or  hereafter  in  effect  relating  to  creditors'  rights
generally  and (2) general  principles  of equity  (regardless  of whether  such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and

          (g)  Neither  (1)  the  execution  and  delivery  of  the  Transaction
Documents nor (2) the consummation of the transactions  herein  contemplated nor
the fulfillment of, or compliance with, the terms and provisions  hereof, of any
other  Transaction  Document  will  conflict  with,  or result in a breach of or
violation by KMC VI of any law or any of the terms,  conditions or provisions of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of KMC VI, or of any bond, debenture,
note, mortgage, indenture, or other agreement or instrument to which KMC VI is a
party or by which it or its properties may be bound,  or constitute (or with the
giving of  notice or the  passage  of time or both  will  constitute)  a default
thereunder,  or result  in the  creation  or  imposition  of any  lien,  charge,
security  interest  or  other  encumbrance  of any  nature  whatsoever  upon the

of the  Issuer in  connection  with the sale of the  Notes,  including,  without
limitation, the Private Placement Memorandum,  contain any untrue statement of a

Exchange Act: (1) the Issuer will,  and shall cause the Service  Purchasers  to,
provide  or cause to be  provided  to any  Holder of Notes  and any  prospective
Subsequent  Purchaser thereof  designated by such a Holder,  upon the request of
such Holder or prospective Subsequent Purchaser,  the information required to be
provided to such Holder or prospective  Subsequent  Purchaser by Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the  Securities  Act, and (2) the Issuer shall update such  information so

sale and delivery of the Notes in the manner  contemplated by this Note Purchase
Agreement to register the Notes under the Securities Act;

          (y) No event has occurred and is continuing that constitutes,  or with
the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would  constitute,  an Event
of Default or a Servicer Termination Event under the Transaction Documents;  and

incorporation,  bylaw or other  instrument to which it is a party or by which it
is or may be bound; and

          (z) To the extent,  if any, that the respective  ratings provided with
respect to the Notes by the Rating Agencies are conditional  upon the furnishing
of documents or the taking of any other actions by the Issuer,  the Issuer shall

Trustee of any proposed material  amendments,  modifications or other changes to
any of the other Transaction Documents;

appearance of conducting  business on behalf of the Issuer,  KMC or any of their
Affiliates  or that the assets of KMC VI are  available to pay the  creditors of
the Issuer, KMC or any of their Affiliates,  (4) without limiting the generality
of the  foregoing,  all  oral and  written  communications,  including,  without
limitation,  letters, invoices, purchase orders, contracts,  statements and loan

allocation  of expenses  with  respect to overhead  and other  shared costs with
respect to such premises or lease  agreement) and (6)  characterize  each of the
Issuer  and KMC as  separate  entities  in any  report,  tax  return,  financial
statement, other accounting or business transaction;

          (d) KMC VI  will  cause  its  accounting  records  to be  clearly  and
unambiguously  marked  to show that the  Equipment,  the MGS  Agreement  and the
Contracts  have been  transferred  by KMC VI to the  Issuer  and  pledged by the
Issuer to the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders;

          (e) KMC VI will be a party to the consolidated tax returns of KMC.

     Section 9. INTENTION OF THE PARTIES.  The Indenture and the Notes have been

law as  indebtedness,  and the  Purchasers  by  acceptance of the Notes (and any
Person which is a legal or beneficial owner of any interest in a Note, by virtue
of  such  Person's  acquisition  of a  legal  or  beneficial  interest  therein)
severally  agree to treat the Notes as  indebtedness  for  purposes  of federal,
state  and local  income or  franchise  taxes  and any other tax  imposed  on or
measured by income.

     Section 10. EXPENSES.  Whether or not the transactions  contemplated hereby
and by the Transaction  Documents  shall be consummated,  the Issuer and KMC VI,
jointly  and  severally,  agree to pay  promptly  all  reasonable  out-of-pocket
expenses  incurred by each Purchaser and the Placement  Agent in connection with
such transactions prior to and on the Closing Date, and any amendment initiated,
directly or indirectly,  by the Issuer or any affiliate  thereof (whether or not
such amendment  becomes  effective) or waiver of any such  document,  including,
without  limitation:  (1) the cost and expenses of preparing and reproducing the
Transaction  Documents  and the Private  Placement  Memorandum,  (2) the cost of
arranging for delivery or performance of conditions precedent, (3) all costs and


                                    18
<PAGE>



expenses incurred in connection with the transfer and delivery of the Collateral
and the  issuance  of the Notes to each  Purchaser,  including  custodial  fees,
Trustee's fees, fees for financing statement filings and continuations,  and KMC
VI's, the Trustee's,  the Placement  Agent's,  each Purchaser's and the Issuer's
attorneys' and accountants'  fees. The Issuer further agrees that it will pay or
cause to be paid,  promptly upon demand, any reasonable expense incurred by each
Purchaser in connection  with the  enforcement of each  Purchaser's  rights with
respect to this Note Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction  Documents and
any document executed pursuant hereto or thereto,  including the reasonable fees
and  disbursements  of counsel.  The Issuer  further agrees that it will pay, or
reimburse  each Purchaser for,  promptly upon demand,  all reasonable  costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements of not more than one
counsel for all Purchasers)  incident to or in connection with any proceeding or
governmental investigation against or with respect to the Issuer, KMC VI, or any
subsidiary  or affiliate of any of them and which result  solely  because of the
ownership by each Purchaser of the Notes.  The obligations of the Issuer and KMC
VI under this section shall survive the termination of the Indenture.

     Section 11.  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each of KMC VI and the  Issuer,  jointly and
severally,  agree  to  indemnify  and  hold  harmless  each  Purchaser  and each
Subsequent Purchaser for the amount of any and all losses,  claims,  damages and
liabilities to the extent that any such loss,  claim,  damage or liability arose
out of, or was imposed upon such Purchaser or Subsequent Purchaser by reason of,
the failure by either KMC VI or the Issuer to perform any of its covenants under
the Transaction  Documents or the breach of a representation or warranty made by
either KMC VI or the Issuer. This indemnity shall not apply to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation  by any Purchaser or Subsequent  Purchaser or to the
breach or  alleged  breach of this  Agreement  by any  Purchaser  or  Subsequent
Purchaser.  If any action, suit, proceeding or investigation is commenced, as to
which any Purchaser or Subsequent Purchaser proposes to demand  indemnification,
such  Purchaser  or  Subsequent  Purchaser  shall  notify each of KMC VI and the
Issuer  with  reasonable   promptness.   If  any  action,  suit,  proceeding  or
investigation shall be brought against any Purchaser or Subsequent Purchaser and
if any  Purchaser or  Subsequent  Purchaser  shall  notify  either KMC VI or the
Issuer  of  the   commencement   of  any  such  action,   suit,   proceeding  or
investigation,  each of KMC VI and the Issuer  shall be  entitled  to assume the
defense of such action,  suit,  proceeding or investigation  with counsel of its
choice at its  expense.  Notwithstanding  the  election  of either KMC VI or the
Issuer to assume the defense of such action, suit,  proceeding or investigation,
each of the Purchasers  and each  Subsequent  Purchaser  shall have the right to
employ separate  counsel and to participate in the defense of the action,  suit,
proceeding  or  investigation,  and each of KMC VI and the Issuer shall bear the
reasonable  fees,  costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of
counsel  chosen by either KMC VI or the Issuer to  represent  any  Purchaser  or
Subsequent  Purchaser  would in the  written  opinion of  counsel  chosen by any
Purchaser or Subsequent Purchaser present counsel chosen by either KMC VI or the
Issuer  with a conflict  of  interest;  (ii) either KMC VI or the Issuer has not
employed  counsel to represent  it within a reasonable  time after notice of the
institution of such action, suit,  proceeding or investigation;  or (iii) either
KMC VI or the Issuer shall  authorize any  Purchaser or Subsequent  Purchaser to
employ separate  counsel at the expense of each of KMC VI and the Issuer.  In no
event  shall  either  or both  of KMC VI and the  Issuer  be  liable  to pay the


                                    19
<PAGE>



expenses  of more  than one  counsel  for  each  Purchaser  and each  Subsequent
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 11.

     Section  12.  SURVIVAL.  Each of the  Issuer  and  KMC VI  agree  that  the
representations,  warranties and covenants made by it in this Agreement,  in any
Transaction  Document  and in any  document,  certificate  or  other  instrument
delivered  pursuant  hereto or thereto shall be deemed to be relied upon by each
Purchaser,  notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by or
on behalf of each Purchaser. All representations,  warranties and covenants made
by  any  party  to  this  Note  Purchase  Agreement,  or in any  such  document,
certificate  or other  instrument  shall survive the delivery of and payment for
the Notes.

     Section 13.  NOTICES.  All  communications  provided for or permitted under
this Note Purchase Agreement shall be in writing and delivered by overnight mail
or facsimile followed by overnight courier other than notices and communications
required to be delivered on a regular periodic basis  hereunder,  which delivery
shall be deemed to have been duly given if personally  delivered to or mailed by
registered  mail,  postage  prepaid,  or  transmitted  by  telex,  telegraph  or
facsimile,  with receipt of  answerback or written  confirmation  of the receipt
thereof,  if to a  Purchaser,  addressed to each  Purchaser,  at its address set
forth on Schedule II hereto:  if to the  Issuer,  addressed  to it at 1545 Route
206,  Bedminster,  New Jersey 07921; if to KMC VI, addressed to it at 1545 Route
206,  Bedminster,  New Jersey 07921, or to such other address as the parties may
have  designated  in writing to the other  parties.  Any notice so addressed and
sent  shall be deemed to be given when  received.  The  Issuer  shall  cause the
instructions with respect to payments on the Notes and notification  thereof set
forth in Schedule II hereof to be reflected in the books at the Corporate  Trust
Office of the Trustee  for the  registration  and  transfer of the Notes and all
payments and  notifications  thereof to each  Purchaser  shall,  pursuant to the
Indenture, be made in accordance therewith.

     Section   14.   SEVERABILITY   OF   PROVISIONS.    Any   part,   provision,
representation,  warranty or covenant of this Note Purchase  Agreement  which is
prohibited or which is held to be void or unenforceable  shall be ineffective to
the extent of such  prohibition or  unenforceability  without  invalidating  the
remaining provisions hereof. Any part,  provision,  representation,  warranty or
covenant of this Note Purchase Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable or
is held  to be  void or  unenforceable  in any  jurisdiction  shall,  as to such
jurisdiction,   be   ineffective   to  the   extent  of  such   prohibition   or
unenforceability  without  invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such  prohibition or  unenforceability  in any  jurisdiction  as to any Contract
shall  not  invalidate  or  render  unenforceable  such  provision  in any other
jurisdiction.  To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, the parties  hereto
waive any provision of law which prohibits or renders void or unenforceable  any
provision hereof.

     Section 15.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Note  Purchase  Agreement  may be executed
simultaneously  in any number of counterparts.  Each counterpart shall be deemed
to be an original,  and all such counterparts  shall constitute one and the same

obligations, rights and remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in

proceeding,  and, solely for the purposes of enforcing this  Agreement,  each of
the Issuer and the Purchasers  hereby  irrevocably  submits to the non-exclusive

Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the Trustee, having an address
at Sixth Street and Marquette  Avenue,  MAC  N9311-161,  Minneapolis,  Minnesota
55479,  its true and lawful  attorney-in-fact  and duly authorized agent for the
limited purpose of accepting service of legal process and the Issuer agrees that
service of process  upon such party shall  constitute  personal  service of such
process  on  such  Person.   The  Issuer  shall  maintain  the  designation  and
appointment  of such  authorized  agent  until all  amounts  payable  under this
Agreement  and the Notes shall have been paid in full. If such agent shall cease
to so act, the Issuer shall immediately designate and appoint another such agent
satisfactory to the other parties hereto and shall promptly deliver to the other
parties  hereto  evidence in writing of such other  agent's  acceptance  of such
appointment.

          (b)  EACH  OF  THE  PURCHASERS   AND  THE  ISSUER  HEREBY   KNOWINGLY,
