In the event senior unsecured debt ratings are assigned to the Borrower by both
S&P and Moody's, pricing will be based on the higher of the senior unsecured
debt ratings from either S&P or Moody's in the event of a single split rating,
and one Pricing Level below the higher rating in the event of a double (or more)
split rating. If no senior unsecured debt rating has been assigned to the
Borrower by either S&P or Moody's, the Pricing Level will be set at two rating
levels below the Financial Strength Rating for Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd.
issued by either S&P or Moody's (e.g. a Financial Strength Rating of "A" issued
by S&P would equate to an implied senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+ and
Pricing Level IV). In the event of a single split Financial Strength Rating, the
Pricing Level will be two Pricing Levels below the lowest Financial Strength
Rating (e.g. a Financial Strength Rating of A/A3 would result in a Pricing Level
III) and in the event of a double (or more) split Financial Strength Rating, the
Pricing Level will be two Pricing Levels below the Pricing Level which is one
Pricing Level above the higher Financial Strength Rating ( e.g. a split
Financial Strength Rating of A/Baa1 would result in Pricing Level III). If
neither a senior unsecured debt rating nor a financial strength rating has been
assigned, Pricing Level I shall apply.
