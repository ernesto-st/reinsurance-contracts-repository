<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. <b>Purpose.</b> The purpose
of this Agreement is to provide for, as of the Effective Time, (i) the one
hundred percent (100%) reinsurance by Reinsurer on a coinsurance basis of the
Policy Liabilities, (ii) the assumption by Reinsurer of all Other Assumed
Liabilities with reference only to the Assumed Agreements and (iii) the
agreement by Reinsurer to pay and otherwise perform all of the Other Assumed
Liabilities under the Other Agreements (other than the Assumed Agreements), all
in consideration of the transfer of ownership by Ceding Company to Reinsurer of
the cash and other assets as provided in Section 4.3 and the transfer to
Reinsurer by Ceding Company of certain of Ceding Company&#146;s rights and
obligations under and in connection with the Business as set forth herein.
Reinsurer accepts all service responsibilities with respect to all of the
Business in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Reinsurer will not
accept any liabilities of Ceding Company under this Agreement other than the
Policy Liabilities and the Other Assumed Liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. <b>Cession and
Assignment.</b> As of the Effective Time, Ceding Company hereby cedes to Reinsurer,
and Reinsurer hereby accepts reinsurance on a coinsurance basis, of 100% of the
Policy Liabilities, to the end that then and thereafter, as between the parties
to this Agreement, Ceding Company will have no liability for Policy Liabilities
and no rights to any profits or other benefits of the Business. With respect to
the Other Agreements and the Other Assumed Liabilities, the parties hereby agree
as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.1. As of the Effective
Time, Reinsurer hereby agrees to pay and otherwise perform on behalf of Ceding
Company the Other Assumed Liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.2. As of the Effective

Assumed Agreements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.3. Ceding
Company&#146;s rights and interests under and in all of the Related Agreements,
and each Provider Agreement and Third Party Administration Agreement that is not
an Assumed Agreement, will not be assigned to Reinsurer at the Effective Time,
but may be assigned to Reinsurer after the date hereof in accordance with
Section 3.11; provided, however, that until such assignment, if any, Ceding
Company will provide or cause to be provided to Reinsurer all benefits of Ceding
Company under each such Related Agreement, Provider Agreement and Third Party
Administration Agreement and will enforce for the account of Reinsurer any
rights of Ceding Company arising from each such Related Agreement, Provider
Agreement and Third Party Administration Agreement, so that Reinsurer receives
the full economic and other benefits of each such Related Agreement, Provider
Agreement and Third Party Administration Agreement as though they had been
assigned to Reinsurer. Reinsurer will reimburse Ceding Company for Ceding
Company&#146;s reasonable costs and expenses in so enforcing any such rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.4. As of the Effective
Time, Ceding Company hereby assigns to Reinsurer, and Reinsurer hereby accepts,
all of Ceding Company&#146;s rights and interests in and under the Reinsurance
Agreements and Reinsured Assumed Agreements, if consent to such assignment has
been obtained from the other contracting party thereto or no such consent was
required, except that Reinsurer will not acquire any of the Ceding
Company&#146;s claims against LeafRe pursuant to the LeafRe Reinsurance
Agreements that arise before the Effective Time. If such consent has not been
obtained, from and after the Effective Time, Ceding Company will provide or
cause to be provided to Reinsurer all benefits of Ceding Company under such
unassigned Reinsurance Agreements and Reinsured Assumed Agreements and will
enforce for the account of Reinsurer any rights of Ceding Company arising from
such unassigned Reinsurance Agreements and Reinsured Assumed Agreements, so that
Reinsurer receives the full economic and other benefits of the Reinsurance
Agreements and Reinsured Assumed Agreements as though they had been assigned to
Reinsurer. Reinsurer will reimburse Ceding Company for Ceding Company&#146;s
reasonable costs and expenses in so enforcing any such rights. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. <b>Ceding Company Access
to Provider Agreements and Third Party Administration Agreements.</b> Beginning at
the Effective Time and extending through the Policy Termination Date, with
respect to the Provider Agreements and Third Party Administration Agreements
that are Assumed Agreements, as such agreements relate to the Reinsured
Policies, Reinsurer will provide to Ceding Company such rights and benefits
under such agreements as are necessary and appropriate for Ceding Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement as the direct writer of the
Reinsured Policies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4. <b>LeafRe Reinsurance
Agreements.</b> None of the Reinsured Policies is subject to the LeafRe Reinsurance
Agreements except for the Reinsured Policies that both (A) were included in the
periodic financial reports provided by Protective Life Insurance Company and
Protective Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company to LeafRe on or before March 31,
2001 as being reinsured pursuant to the LeafRe Reinsurance Agreements, or were
reinsured pursuant to the LeafRe Reinsurance Agreements in the ordinary course
of business after March 31, 2001, and (B) continue in force as of the Effective
Time (such Reinsured Policies referred to in (A) and (B) being referred to as
the &#147;LeafRe Covered Policies&#148;). The Reinsured Policies that are not
subject to the LeafRe Reinsurance Agreements include, without limitation, the
Reinsured Policies that are the subject of legal actions between Ceding Company
and LeafRe or an Affiliate of LeafRe initiated prior to the Effective Time.
Ceding Company is retaining all claims against LeafRe with respect to the LeafRe
Reinsurance Agreements arising prior to the Effective Time and is retaining all
obligations to LeafRe with respect to the LeafRe Reinsurance Agreements arising
prior to the Effective Time, including any obligations to LeafRe relative to all
Reinsured Policies that are not LeafRe Covered Policies. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Ceding Company acknowledges that Reinsurer
may retrocede all or part of the Reinsured Policies subject to the LeafRe
Reinsurance Agreements to another insurance company or companies, and Ceding
Company hereby consents to such retrocession and agrees to cooperate to
effectuate such retrocession to the extent reasonably requested by Reinsurer;
provided, however, that no such retrocession will relieve Reinsurer of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Reinsured Policies. The
aggregate amount of the deposit funds, as referred to in the LeafRe Reinsurance
Agreements, are and will be included in the Reserves within the line &#147;Funds
at Interest&#148; in the Indemnity Accounting, the Preliminary Effective Date
Accounting and the Effective Date Accounting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. <b>Duration of
Reinsurance.</b> The liability of Reinsurer under this Agreement with respect to any
Reinsured Policy will begin simultaneously with that of Ceding Company, but not
before the Effective Time. Reinsurer&#146;s liability with respect to any
Reinsured Policy will not terminate until Ceding Company&#146;s liability on
such Reinsured Policy terminates. Reinsurer&#146;s liability with respect to any
Related Agreement, any Provider Agreement or any Third Party Administration
Agreement will not terminate until Ceding Company&#146;s liability under such
agreement terminates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2. <b>Responsibility for

Excluded Liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3. <b>Changes to Existing
Policies or New Policies. </b>Except as otherwise set forth herein, any changes to
Existing Policies or New Policies may be made only with the prior written
consent of Ceding Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Ceding Company will not make any changes to the terms
and conditions of a Reinsured Policy or withdraw or terminate any form of
Reinsured Policy on file with any Governmental Entity, except in either case
with Reinsurer&#146;s prior written consent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that Ceding
Company will be entitled to make changes to a Reinsured Policy or withdraw or
terminate the form of a Reinsured Policy to the extent such action is required
by applicable law or pursuant to the terms of the Reinsured Policy, and Ceding
Company shall have given written notice thereof to Reinsurer in advance of
taking such action. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4.     <b>Conversions. </b> At and after the Effective  Time,  Reinsurer will issue or cause to be issued any individual
conversion policy that may be required under the terms of a Reinsured Policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5. <b>Errors and Omissions.</b>
If through an oversight, Ceding Company fails to list an Existing Policy on
<u>Exhibit A</u>, a Reinsurance Agreement on <u>Exhibit E</u>, a Reinsured Assumed Agreement
on <u>Exhibit F</u>, a Related Agreement on <u>Exhibit G</u>, a Third Party Administration
Agreement on <u>Exhibit H</u>, or a Provider Agreement on <u>Exhibit D</u> or if Ceding
Company fails to transfer to Reinsurer any Reserves or applicable Premiums with
respect thereto and a party discovers such error in the information in any such
Exhibit or in the transfer of such Reserves or Premiums, the party discovering
the error must promptly notify the other party and provide information
documenting the error. The parties then in good faith will attempt to resolve
the matter, and if the parties cannot resolve the matter, the matter will be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 7, in each case in order to
place both parties in the positions they would have been in had the error not
occurred. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.6. <b>New Policies</b>. During
the period that begins at the Effective Time and ends on the Marketing
Termination Date, New Policies will be issued by Ceding Company at the request
of Reinsurer; provided, however, that a New Policy that is delivered after the
Marketing Termination Date but that has an effective date that is on or prior to
the Marketing Termination Date shall, for the purposes of this Section 3.6 and
of Section 3.7, be deemed issued on such effective date. Each New Policy will
have a term not to exceed one (1) year from its effective date; provided,
however, that a New Policy may have a term not to exceed two (2) years from its
effective date or may provide a guaranteed Premium rate for an initial two-year
period from its effective date, if such New Policy is issued prior to the
Marketing Termination Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with
Ceding Company&#146;s past practices. Reinsurer will pay all expenses and
perform all responsibilities related to the issue of any New Policies as
permitted under this Agreement, including but not limited to all expenses
related to agent appointments, commissions, marketing and printing. A New Policy
may not include any term or condition that would prevent the termination of such
policy on or at any time after the Policy Termination Date, other than a term
that is the same as is contained in one of the forms of New Policies set forth
in <u>Exhibit C</u> providing for a prior notice of termination or an effective date of
termination. Reinsurer will provide and maintain all documentation related to
the appointment of agents in connection with the sale or issue of New Policies.
Ceding Company will cooperate with such agent appointments but it may, in its
reasonable discretion, terminate the appointment of any agent following prior
notice to Reinsurer of such intended action if, in Ceding Company&#146;s
reasonable judgment, such agent is creating an unreasonable business or legal
risk for Ceding Company. Ceding Company will promptly terminate the appointment
of any agent to sell New Policies if directed in writing to do so by Reinsurer.
In marketing New Policies as permitted under this Agreement, Reinsurer may use
only those marketing materials approved for use by Ceding Company at the
Effective Time or that may be approved by Ceding Company after the Effective
Time at the request of Reinsurer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Reinsurer may not otherwise use Ceding Company&#146;s
name, logo, trademarks or trade names, except as permitted by Section 5.14 of
this Agreement or by the Purchase Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.7. <b>Renewal and
Termination of Existing and New Policies.</b> At and after the Effective Time and
before the Marketing Termination Date, Ceding Company will, at Reinsurer&#146;s
request, renew any Existing Policy at the conclusion of the normal renewal cycle
for such policy or on the anniversary date for such policy for a term not to
exceed one (1) year and at rates determined by Reinsurer. In addition, Ceding
Company will renew a New Policy after the Marketing Termination Date, at
Reinsurer&#146;s request, where appropriate to honor a two-year rate guarantee
for a New Policy that was issued before the Marketing Termination Date for a
period not to extend beyond the Policy Termination Date and at rates determined
by Reinsurer. Reinsurer will pay all expenses and perform all responsibilities
related to the renewal of any Existing Policies or New Policies as permitted
under this Agreement, including but not limited to all expenses related to agent
appointments, commissions, marketing and printing. With respect to any such
renewal of an Existing Policy or New Policy after the Effective Time, Reinsurer
may not provide or include any term or condition that would prevent the
termination of such policy on or at any time after the Policy Termination Date,
other than a term providing for a prior notice of termination or an effective
date of termination that is the same as is contained in such Existing Policy (in
the case of a renewal of an Existing Policy) or in one of the forms of New
Policies set forth in <u>Exhibit C</u> (in the case of a renewal of a New Policy).
After the Marketing Termination Date, except as provided above in this Section
3.7 or in Section 3.6, Ceding Company will not be obligated to renew any
Existing Policy or New Policy or to issue any New Policy, and Reinsurer may not
do so on Ceding Company&#146;s behalf. Reinsurer agrees that, on and after the
Policy Termination Date, at Ceding Company&#146;s written direction, Reinsurer
will, on Ceding Company&#146;s behalf, terminate any Existing Policy or any New
Policy that may be in force on such date in accordance and consistent with the
provisions thereof and, that if Reinsurer fails to so terminate any such
Existing Policy or New Policy prior to the earlier of (x) sixty (60) calendar
days after Reinsurer receives such notice from Ceding Company and (y) five (5)
business days prior to the renewal date of such Existing Policy or New Policy,
then Ceding Company may terminate such Existing Policy or New Policy. Ceding
Company represents and warrants to Reinsurer that all policy forms listed on
<u>Exhibits A</u> and <u>C</u> contain terms and conditions that will not preclude Reinsurer
from complying with the obligations in Section 3.7 and this Section 3.8,
including, without limitation, the obligation to permit Existing Policies to be
terminated on and after the Policy Termination Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.8. <b>Compliance with
Certain Agreements.</b> Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, without
Ceding Company&#146;s prior written consent, Reinsurer will not cause to be
issued any New Policy to any state or federally chartered credit union operating
in the United States. In the event that BBI does not agree to terminate the BBI
Marketing Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, then anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, without Ceding Company&#146;s prior written
consent, Reinsurer will not cause to be issued any New Policy or cause to be
renewed any Existing Policy in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, West Virginia, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware or
New York other than through BBI. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.9. <b>Compliance with Law.</b>
Reinsurer will comply in all material respects with all state insurance laws and
regulations and all other applicable laws and regulations in performing its
activities under this Section 3 and its other obligations under this Agreement,
including but not limited to its appointment of agents on behalf of Ceding
Company, its payment of commissions to such agents and its use of marketing
materials, and no approval by Ceding Company under Section 3.7 above of any
marketing materials used by Reinsurer will be deemed to waive any liability of
Reinsurer to Ceding Company under this Agreement arising from the failure of
such marketing materials to comply with such laws and regulations. Ceding
Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply with directions
from Reinsurer with respect to issuance of New Policies, renewals of Existing
Policies and New Policies, and administration of Reinsured Policies, so long as
such directions comply with all applicable laws and are not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Agreement. Reinsurer will reimburse Ceding Company for
Ceding Company&#146;s reasonable costs and expenses in complying with such
directions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.10.    <b>Credit for Ceded  Reinsurance.</b>  Subject to Section 8 hereof,  Reinsurer  will  maintain  all  licenses  or
otherwise  take all action  that may be  necessary  for  Ceding  Company to obtain  full  financial  credit for the
Reinsured Policies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.11. <b>Assignment of Certain
Other Agreements. </b>From and after the Effective Time, as may be requested by
Reinsurer from time to time, Ceding Company will assign to Reinsurer, and
Reinsurer will assume and accept, all of Ceding Company&#146;s rights and
interests in and under any Related Agreement, Provider Agreement and Third Party
Administration Agreement that has not been previously assumed by Reinsurer
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (including assumptions pursuant to
this Section 3.11); provided, however, that to the extent that any such
assignment would preclude Ceding Company from lawfully fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement, then as a condition to such assignment,
Reinsurer and Ceding Company will enter into an appropriate agreement to provide
Ceding Company with the necessary rights and benefits under such assigned
agreement to enable Ceding Company to fulfill lawfully its obligations under
this Agreement; and provided further, that following the Policy Termination Date
(but not prior to such date), Ceding Company will terminate any of the Related
Agreements, Provider Agreements or Third Party Administration Agreements that
have not then been assigned to Reinsurer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.12. <b>Approval of Reinsurer
Rates and Forms.</b> Reinsurer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
approval of Reinsurer&#146;s rates and policy forms from the relevant regulatory
authorities to enable Reinsurer to convert the Reinsured Policies to
Reinsurer&#146;s own policies on the first practicable policy renewal date (in
accordance with Section 3.7) following the Effective Date. </FONT></P>

Company agrees to execute and deliver to Reinsurer any further instruments or
assurances that Reinsurer may reasonably request for more effectual vesting of
Reinsurer&#146;s right, title and interest in and to such Policy-Related Assets.
To the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Entity
determines that the foregoing transfer and conveyance of Policy-Related Assets
is not effective to vest absolute and irrevocable title in such Policy-Related
Assets in Reinsurer, then Ceding Company hereby grants to Reinsurer a first

Date Accounting.</b> Ceding Company has delivered to Reinsurer not later than five
business days prior to the Effective Date an accounting, as of the last day of
the calendar month that is two months immediately preceding the calendar month

Liabilities and Policy-Related Assets as of such date in the same form as the
Indemnity Accounting (the &#147;<u>Preliminary Effective Date Accounting</u>&#148;).
Such accounting was reviewed and accompanied by a certificate signed by Ceding

Actuaries, certifying that all items appearing on such accounting were: (i)
correct to the best knowledge of such actuary and do not contain errors in

Ceding Company; (iii) calculated in accordance with applicable SAP; and (iv)
prepared using the same accounting and actuarial methodologies, assumptions and

sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the Effective Date Accounting to
review such accounting and suggest changes or corrections thereto. On or before
the end of such period, Reinsurer will notify Ceding Company in writing whether
or not it accepts the Effective Date Accounting. If Reinsurer fails to so notify
Ceding Company, Reinsurer will be deemed to have accepted the Effective Date
Accounting. If Reinsurer notifies Ceding Company that it does not accept the
Effective Date Accounting, Reinsurer will set forth in reasonable detail its
objections thereto and the reasons for such objections. The parties in good
faith will discuss and negotiate any such objections in an effort to reach
agreement on the Effective Date Accounting. If despite good faith negotiations
the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) calendar days after
Ceding Company&#146;s receipt of Reinsurer&#146;s notice of objections, then the
parties will submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with Section 7,
except that all arbitrators must be Members of the American Academy of Actuaries
familiar with the types of policies included in the Reinsured Policies, and the
arbitrators will determine the Effective Date Accounting in accordance with the
standards set forth in items (i) through (iv) of Section 4.5.1. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.5.3. Within ten (10)
calendar days after agreement is reached on the Effective Date Accounting or the

parties will settle any differences on such accountings as follows: (i) if the
Net Transfer Amount Difference is positive, then Ceding Company will pay such
difference to Reinsurer in cash; and (ii) if the Net Transfer Amount Difference
is negative, then Reinsurer will pay such difference to Ceding Company in cash.
&#147;<u>Net Transfer Amount Difference</u>&#148; means the result of subtracting the
value of the Preliminary Transfer Amount from the value of the Adjusted Transfer
Amount. Payment of the Net Transfer Amount Difference will be accompanied by the
payment of interest thereon from the Effective Date to and including the date of
payment at an annual rate equal to the 90-Day Treasury Rate in effect on the

<h3 align=left>4.6.     True-Up Accounting.</h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6.1. Within sixty (60)

same form as the Preliminary Effective Date Accounting and the Effective Date
Accounting, of all Policy-Related Liabilities and Policy-Related Assets as of
the Effective Date (the &#147;<u>True-Up Accounting</U>&#148;). Such accounting must be
reviewed and accompanied by a certificate signed by Reinsurer&#146;s chief
actuary who is a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries, certifying that
all items appearing on such accounting were: (i) correct to the best knowledge
of such actuary and do not contain errors in calculation, methodology or

in accordance with applicable SAP; and (iv) to the best knowledge of such
actuary, prepared using the same accounting and actuarial methodologies,
assumptions and procedures, and the application thereof, that Ceding Company
utilized in preparing its statutory Annual Statement as of December 31, 2000,
the Indemnity Accounting, the Preliminary Effective Date Accounting and the
Effective Date Accounting. The True-Up Accounting will include a statement
comparing the values of the items set forth on the True-Up Accounting with the
values of such items on the Effective Date Accounting and computing the
difference in such values; provided, however, that the True-Up Accounting will
make no true-up adjustment for items that customarily are included in Exhibit 8
and Exhibit 9 of the NAIC Annual Statement Blank (other than the A&amp;H benefit
reserves that are customarily included in Exhibits 8 and 9, which will be
adjusted as part of the True-Up Accounting). With respect to the Reserves that
have been estimated for claims for policy benefits under the Reinsured Policies,
the True-Up Accounting will restate the liability for claims that were incurred
before the Effective Time but not reported as of the Effective Time by replacing
the estimated liability for such claims that was included in the Effective Date
Accounting with the sum of (a) the actual runoff of such claims that were
incurred before the Effective Time and that have been paid since the Effective
Time, plus (b) an estimate for any such claims that were incurred before the
Effective Time and may be unpaid as of the date that is one year after the
Effective Time. To the extent that the actual amounts of any other
Policy-Related Liabilities and Policy-Related Assets as of the Effective Date
become determinable prior to the preparation of the True-Up Accounting, such
items will be reflected on the True-Up Accounting as such actual amounts rather
than estimations. Reinsurer will provide Ceding Company with a copy of all work
papers and data used, and access to all personnel involved, in preparing the
True-Up Accounting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6.2. Ceding Company will

Reinsurer, Ceding Company will be deemed to have accepted the True-Up

Company will set forth in reasonable detail its objections thereto and the
reasons for such objections. The parties in good faith will discuss and

will settle any differences on such accountings as follows: (i) if the True-Up
Value Difference is positive, then Ceding Company will pay such difference to
Reinsurer in cash; and (ii) if the True-Up Value Difference is negative, then
Reinsurer will pay such difference to Ceding Company in cash. &#147;<u>True-Up
Value Difference</U>&#148; means the result of subtracting the value for the

established and maintained as a liability on its statutory statements not less
than the statutory reserves and claims reserves required by all applicable
regulatory authorities and as calculated in accordance with applicable SAP and
in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. With respect to the
Reinsured Policies, at and after the Effective Time, Reinsurer will establish
and maintain as a liability on its statutory statements not less than the
statutory reserves and claim reserves required by applicable SAP and in
accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles. If Reinsurer reinsures
or retrocedes the Reinsured Policies to an Affiliate or other Person outside of
the United States, such reserves will be maintained in the United States
pursuant to a funds withheld, trust or other arrangement (reasonably acceptable
to Ceding Company) to secure Ceding Company&#146;s continuing obligations
thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.10.    <b>Commissions.</b>  If Ceding  Company pays any  Commissions  that are the  obligation of Reinsurer  pursuant to

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.11. <b>Reimbursements.</b> If
Reinsurer fails to pay any Policy Liabilities, Reinsurer will reimburse Ceding
Company for all Policy Liabilities that may be paid by Ceding Company at and
after the Effective Time, provided that any such payments by Ceding Company will
be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Reinsured
Policy or Other Agreement. The reimbursements required by this Section 4.11 will
be paid by Reinsurer to Ceding Company within ten (10) calendar days of
Reinsurer&#146;s receipt of written notice from Ceding Company thereof. Such
written notice from Ceding Company will be accompanied by such supporting
information and detail as Reinsurer reasonably requests. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.12. <b>Wire Transfers.</b> Any

if the payee provides to the payer appropriate wire transfer instructions at

In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.848-2(g)(8), Ceding Company
and Reinsurer hereby elect to determine specified policy acquisition expenses
with respect to this Agreement without regard to the general deductions
limitation of Section 848(c)(1) of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.1. All uncapitalized

regulations under Section 848 of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.2. The party with net
positive consideration under this Agreement for each taxable year will
capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to this Agreement
without regard to the general deductions limitation of Section 848(c)(1) of the
Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.3. Both parties will
exchange information pertaining to the amount of net consideration under this
Agreement each year to ensure consistency. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.4. Reinsurer will
submit a schedule to Ceding Company by May&#160;1 of each year of its
calculation (&#147;<u>Reinsurer&#146;s DAC Calculation</u>&#148;) of the net
consideration under this Agreement for the preceding taxable year. This schedule
of calculations must be accompanied by a statement signed by an authorized
representative of Reinsurer stating that Reinsurer will report such net
consideration in its federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.5. Ceding Company may
contest such calculation by providing an alternative calculation (&#147;<u>Ceding
Company&#146;s DAC Calculation</u>&#148;) to Reinsurer in writing within thirty (30)
calendar days after the date on which Ceding Company receives Reinsurer&#146;s
calculation. If Ceding Company does not so notify Reinsurer, Ceding Company will
report the net consideration under this Agreement as determined by Reinsurer in
Ceding Company&#146;s federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.6. If Ceding Company
contests Reinsurer&#146;s calculation of the net consideration under this
Agreement, the parties will negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement as to
the correct amount of net consideration within thirty (30) calendar days after
the date on which Ceding Company submits its alternative calculation. If
Reinsurer and Ceding Company reach agreement as to the amount of net
consideration under this Agreement, each party will report such amount in its
federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year. If, during such
period, Reinsurer and Ceding Company are unable to reach agreement, they will
promptly thereafter cause independent accountants of nationally recognized
standing reasonably satisfactory to Reinsurer and Ceding Company (who will not
have any material relationship with Reinsurer or Ceding Company), promptly to
review (which review will commence no later than five (5) business days after
the selection of such independent accountants), this Agreement and the
calculations of Reinsurer and Ceding Company for the purpose of calculating the
net consideration under this Agreement. Such independent accountants will
deliver to Reinsurer and Ceding Company, as promptly as practicable (but no
later than sixty (60) calendar days after the commencement of their review), a
report setting forth such calculation, which calculation will result in a net
consideration between the amount thereof shown in Reinsurer&#146;s DAC
Calculation and the amount thereof shown in Ceding Company&#146;s DAC
Calculation. Such report will be final and binding upon Reinsurer and Ceding
Company. The fees, costs and expenses of such independent accountant will be
borne (i) by Ceding Company if the difference between the net consideration as
calculated by the independent accountants and Ceding Company&#146;s DAC
Calculation is greater than the difference between the net consideration as
calculated by the independent accountants and Reinsurer&#146;s DAC Calculation,
(ii) by Reinsurer if the first such difference is less than the second such
difference, and (iii) otherwise equally by Reinsurer and Ceding Company. </FONT></P>

which this Agreement remains in effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.8. Both parties will
attach a schedule to their respective federal income tax returns for the first
taxable year ending after the date on which this election becomes effective
which identifies this Agreement as a reinsurance agreement for which an election
has been made under Treasury Regulations Section 1.848-2(g)(8). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.14. <b>Premium Taxes.</b>
Notwithstanding Sections 4.7 and 4.11 above, Reinsurer will reimburse Ceding
Company for Premium taxes that are part of the Policy Liabilities on the basis
specified herein. For each calendar year, Reinsurer will reimburse such Premium
tax payments, with respect to each state and municipality, on an annual basis,
within thirty (30) calendar days after Reinsurer receives a billing from Ceding
Company for Reinsurer&#146;s share of such Premium taxes paid. Reinsurer&#146;s
share will be determined on the basis of each such state&#146;s actual
applicable tax rate multiplied by the Premiums for the Reinsured Policies
received in such state during the annual period. Such Premium taxes will be
reduced to the extent of any credit that Ceding Company is entitled to take in
any such year on its Premium tax returns for any amounts paid by Reinsurer for
the guaranty fund assessments and similar charges that are part of the Policy
Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, because Ceding Company is required
by law to pay estimated Premium taxes on a quarterly basis throughout each
calendar year, Reinsurer will pay Ceding Company such Premium tax reimbursements
on a quarterly basis within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of a
written estimate prepared by Ceding Company, and the parties will make any
necessary adjustment at the end of the calendar year so that Reinsurer only
reimburses Ceding Company for the actual Premium taxes on the basis specified
above. </FONT></P>

any action, proceeding or investigation (an &#147;Asserted Liability&#148;) that
may result in a Loss, such indemnified party must give written notice thereof
(the &#147;Claims Notice&#148;) to the indemnifying party. The Claims Notice
must describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail and indicate the
amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by

obligations of confidentiality). If the indemnifying party elects to compromise
or defend such Asserted Liability, it will within thirty (30) calendar days from
receipt of the Claims Notice notify the indemnified party of its intent to do
so, and the indemnified party will cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying

indemnified party fails to cooperate, then each indemnifying party will be
relieved of its obligations under this <U>Section 6</u> only to the extent that such
indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure to cooperate. Unless and until
the indemnifying party elects to defend the Asserted Liability, the indemnified

appropriate; provided, however, that the indemnified party will not settle or
compromise any Asserted Liability for which it seeks indemnification hereunder

Liability that it has elected not to defend with its own counsel and at its own

such manner as is determined to be appropriate by the arbitrators; provided that
the arbitrators will be bound by and will limit their awards based upon the
limitations of liability contained in this Agreement. A party may, however, seek
an emergency temporary restraining order, if appropriate under applicable law,

of Class A Assets plus the market value of Class B Assets will at all times be
at least equal to 110% of (x) Policy-Related Liabilities minus (y)
Policy-Related Assets at such time. The form and duration of assets to be held

Person who acquires all or substantially all of the equity or assets of such

not assign this Agreement to any Person having a Moody&#146;s Investors Service
Insurance Financial Strength Rating below A1 or that is not rated by

filing with respect to such party made with an insurance regulatory authority,
the approval of any plan to liquidate, merge or dissolve Reinsurer or Ceding

Company, its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, without diminution
because of the insolvency. Any conservator, receiver, liquidator or statutory
successor of Ceding Company will give prompt written notice to Reinsurer of the
pendency or submission of a claim under any Reinsured Policy. During the
pendency of such claim, Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at
its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any
defense available to Ceding Company or its conservator, receiver, liquidator or
statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by Reinsurer is chargeable
against Ceding Company as a part of the expense of insolvency, liquidation or

accrues to Ceding Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by
Reinsurer. </FONT></P>
