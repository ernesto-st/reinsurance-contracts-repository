          Book-Entry Preferred Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to <U>Section
          4.2(c)</U>, will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent or Paying Agents, to

          Securities upon surrender of their Preferred Securities Certificates.

          called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive
          the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust
          Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such
          Securities will cease to be Outstanding. In the event that any date on which any
          Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the
          Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day

          will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for
          distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the
          Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation
          Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to
          the date of payment (such amount being the &#147;Liquidation
          Distribution&#148;). If, upon any such winding up the Liquidation Distribution
          can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets
          available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject
          to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer Trust on the
          Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation
          Amounts). The Holder of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive
          Liquidation Distributions upon any such winding-up pro rata (determined as
          aforesaid) with Holders of all Trust Securities, except that, if an Indenture
          Event of Default specified in <U>Section 5.1(1)</U> or <U>5.1(2)</U> of the
          Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Preferred Securities shall have a
          priority over the Common Securities as provided in <U>Section 4.3</U>. </FONT></P></TD>

substantially the same terms as the Preferred Securities (the &#147;Successor

Preferred Securities with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation,
redemption and otherwise, (ii) a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same

such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does
not cause the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded

(v) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease
does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the
Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (vi)
such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Issuer Trust,
(vii) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer
or lease, the Depositor has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A) such
merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not
adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Preferred
Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (B) following
such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease,
neither the Issuer Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an

the Issuer Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of all of the Preferred
Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey,
transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other
Person or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or
replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer
or lease would cause the Issuer Trust or the successor entity to be taxable as a
corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income
tax purposes or cause the Debt Securities to be treated as other than indebtedness of the
Depositor for United States federal income tax purposes. </FONT></P>

          The Depository Trust Company (&#147;DTC&#148;), New York, NY, will act as
          securities depository for the securities (the &#147;Securities&#148;). The
          Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name
          of Cede &amp; Co. (DTC&#146;s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be
          requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Security
          certificate will be issued for the Securities, in the aggregate principal amount
          of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          DTC, the world&#146;s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company
          organized under the New York Banking Law, a &#147;banking organization&#148;
          within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve
          System, a &#147;clearing corporation&#148; within the meaning of the New York
          Uniform Commercial Code, and a &#147;clearing agency&#148; registered pursuant
          to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC
          holds and provides asset servicing for over 2 million issues of U.S. and
          non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market
          instruments from over 85 countries that DTC&#146;s participants (&#147;Direct
          Participants&#148;) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade
          settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions
          in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers
          and pledges between Direct Participants&#146; accounts. This eliminates the need
          for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include
          both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
          clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned
          subsidiary of The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation
          (&#147;DTCC&#148;). DTCC, in turn, is owned by a number of Direct Participants
          of DTC and Members of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, Government
          Securities Clearing Corporation, MBS Clearing Corporation, and Emerging Markets
          Clearing Corporation, (NSCC, GSCC, MBSCC, and EMCC, also subsidiaries of DTCC),
          as well as by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange
          LLC, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC
          system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities
          brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that
          clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant,
          either directly or indirectly (&#147;Indirect Participants&#148;). DTC has
          Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s highest rating: AAA. The DTC Rules applicable to its
          Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More
          information about DTC can be found at <B>www.dtcc.com</B>. </FONT></P>

          Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct
          Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC&#146;s
          records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security
          (&#147;Beneficial Owner&#148;) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and
          Indirect Participants&#146; records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written
          confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however,
          expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction,
          as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect
          Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.
          Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by
          entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf
          of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates
          representing their ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that
          use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued. </FONT></P>

          To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct
          Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC&#146;s partnership
          nominee, Cede &amp; Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized
          representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration
          in the name of Cede &amp; Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change
          in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of
          the Securities; DTC&#146;s records reflect only the identity of the Direct
          Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may
          not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain
          responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. </FONT></P>

          Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by
          Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and
          Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements
          among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
          effect from time to time. </FONT></P>

          Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities
          within an issue are being redeemed, DTC&#146;s practice is to determine by lot
          the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be
          redeemed. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Flush" FSL="Default" -->

          Neither DTC nor Cede &amp; Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote
          with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in
          accordance with DTC&#146;s Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an
          Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus
          Proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.&#145;s consenting or voting rights to those Direct
          Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date
          (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). </FONT></P>

          Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will
          be made to Cede &amp; Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an
          authorized representative of DTC. DTC&#146;s practice is to credit Direct
          Participants&#146; accounts upon DTC&#146;s receipt of funds and corresponding
          detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in accordance with
          their respective holdings shown on DTC&#146;s records. Payments by Participants
          to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary
          practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in
          bearer form or registered in &#147;street name,&#148; and will be the
          responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC [nor its nominee], Agent, or
          Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect
          from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend
          payments to Cede &amp; Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an
          authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent,
          disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility
          of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the
          responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. </FONT></P>

          DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the
          Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under
          such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained,
          Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered. </FONT></P>

          Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers
          through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Security
