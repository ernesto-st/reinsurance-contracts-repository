                                  THE CREDITS

      2.1 Commitment. (a) From and including the Effective Date and on or prior
to May 1, 2002 (or any earlier date on which the Aggregate Commitment is reduced
to zero or otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms hereof), each Lender
severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to
make Advances to Borrower, ratably in accordance with each Lender's Pro Rata
Share, provided that, after giving effect to the making of each such


                                       28
<PAGE>

Loan, such Lender's Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed the amount of
its Commitment. Principal payments made on the Advances may not be reborrowed
and shall permanently reduce each Lender's Commitment by the amount of such
principal payment multiplied by such Lender's Pro Rata Share.

      2.2 Required Payments; Termination.

            (a) Borrower shall make the principal payments on the Loans required
under Sections 6.13 and 6.17, and shall make additional principal payments
necessary to reduce the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure to an amount not
in excess of the amounts set forth below, on or before the corresponding date
set forth for each such amount:

      2.7 Optional Principal Payments. Borrower may from time to time pay,
without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a

Administrative Agent.

      2.8 Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.

            Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each
Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time,
provided that (a) the Interest Period with respect to the Effective Date Advance
and any subsequent Advance made prior to the Syndication Date shall be one
month, and Interest Periods with respect to all Advances made prior to the
Syndication Date shall begin and end on the same days and (b) no Interest Period
may be selected prior to the Syndication Date if the Administration Agent has
notified Borrower that the selection of such Interest Period would interfere
with the closing of the primary syndication of the Commitments and the Loans.
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing
Notice") not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) at least five Business Days
before the Borrowing Date of each Floating Rate Advance and five Business Days
before the Borrowing Date for each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

            (i) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
Advance,

            (ii) the aggregate amount of such Advance,

            (iii) the Type of Advance selected, and

            (iv) in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period
applicable thereto,

and containing a certification by an Authorized Officer that all conditions
precedent specified in Article IV are satisfied on the specified Borrowing Date.
Not later than 5:00 p.m. (New York


                                       31
<PAGE>

time) on the Business Day on which the Administrative Agent receives a Borrowing
Notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the aggregate
amount of the Advance and the amount of such Lender's Loan to be advanced on the
Borrowing Date, the type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurodollar Advance,
the Interest Period applicable thereto. Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York
time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans
in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII. The Administrative Agent will make the funds
so received from the Lenders available to Borrower at the Administrative Agent's
aforesaid address.

      2.9 Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating
Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section
2.9 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.7. Each Eurodollar Advance shall
continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest
Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a
Eurodollar Advance for an interest period of one month unless (x) such
Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7, (y) Borrower
shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as
defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such
Eurodollar Advance be converted to a Floating Rate Advance or continued as a
Eurodollar Advance for an Interest Period of more than one month or (z) a
Default or Unmatured Monetary Default has occurred and continues, in which event
such Eurodollar Advance shall, unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, be
automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance. Subject to the terms of
Section 2.6, Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of
a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance. Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of
each conversion of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance or
continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time)
at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or
continuation, specifying:

                  (i) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
conversion or continuation,

                  (ii) the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to
be converted or continued, and

                  (iii) the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into
or continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest Period
applicable thereto.

      2.10 Interest Rate; Changes in Interest Rate; Interest Periods; etc. Each
Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is
converted from a Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to
Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a
Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to
the Floating Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion
of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect
simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar
Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and
including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but


                                       32
<PAGE>

not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate
determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance
based upon Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and otherwise in
accordance with the terms hereof. Unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree,
no Interest Period may be selected at any time when a Default or Unmatured
Default has occurred and is continuing. No Interest Period may end after the
Maturity Date. All Loans comprising a Eurodollar Advance in respect of any
single borrowing hereunder shall at all times have the same Interest Period. The
initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Advance shall commence on the date
such Advance is made or converted into a Eurodollar Advance, and each Interest
Period thereafter in respect of such Eurodollar Advance shall commence on the
day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires.

      2.11 Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a Default or
Unmatured Monetary Default, no Advance may be made as, converted into or
continued as a Eurodollar Advance, unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree
(notwithstanding any provision of Section 10.2 requiring unanimous consent of
the Lenders to changes in interest rates). During the continuance of a Default
the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which
notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any
provision of Section 10.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes
in interest rates), declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest
for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise
applicable to such Interest Period plus 3% per annum, and (ii) each Floating
Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate
in effect from time to time plus 3% per annum, provided that, during the
continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Advances without any
election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

      2.12 Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be
made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's address specified
pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Office of the Administrative
Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by 2:00
p.m. (Eastern time) on the date when due and shall be applied as follows:

            (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(b) below, all payments
of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all payments of fees
and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations, and any other
amounts received by the Administrative Agent from or for the benefit of the
Borrower shall be applied in the following order:

                  (i) to pay principal of and interest on any portion of the
Loans which the Administrative Agent may (at its sole option, and without any
obligation to do so) have advanced on behalf of any Lender (other than itself in
its capacity as a Lender) for which the Administrative Agent has not then been
reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower;

                  (ii) to pay principal of and interest on any Protective
Advance made by the Administrative Agent (at its sole option, and without any
obligation to do so) for which the Administrative Agent has not then been paid
by Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders; and


                                       33
<PAGE>

                  (iii) to pay all other Obligations then due and payable in the
order designated by the Borrower and, unless otherwise designated by the
Borrower, all principal payments in respect of Loans shall be applied first, to
repay outstanding Floating Rate Loans, and then to repay outstanding Eurodollar
Loans with those Eurodollar Loans which have earlier expiring Interest Periods
being repaid prior to those which have later expiring Interest Periods.

            (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may apply all payments in respect of
any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral to the Secured Obligations in
such order and manner as the Administrative Agent and Lenders may elect in their
sole and absolute discretion, subject, as among themselves, to any intercreditor
or similar agreement from time to time entered into among the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders.

Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender
shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the
same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Office specified in a
notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.

      2.13 Notes; Evidence of Indebtedness.

            (a) Each Lender's Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note (a
"Note") executed and delivered by Borrower on the Effective Date to such Lender
in the form of Exhibit B. If a Lender assigns a part (but less than all) of its
Note, Borrower shall, upon request, execute and deliver new Notes to the
respective owners of the original note that aggregate the amount of the original
Note, as directed jointly by the assignor and assignee, and upon delivery of the
new Note or Notes, the original Note shall be endorsed to state that it has been
replaced by such new Note or Notes.

            (b) Each Lender is hereby authorized to maintain in accordance with
its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time
to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to
such Lender from time to time hereunder.

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which
it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and
the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder from Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

            (d) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest
error, of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their
terms.

      2.14 Telephonic Notices. Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections
of Types of


                                       34
<PAGE>

Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or
persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be an
Authorized Officer acting on behalf of Borrower, it being understood that the
foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and
Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees
to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such
confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each
telephonic notice, signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation
differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall govern absent manifest error.

      2.15 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on
each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Quarterly Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, on any
date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration
or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the
outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a
Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a Quarterly Payment Date shall be payable
on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be
payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which
the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual days
elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an
Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment
is received prior to 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) at the place of payment. If any
payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time
shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

      2.16 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation
Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent
will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar
Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate.

      2.17 Lending Offices. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Office
selected by such Lender, and may change its Lending Office from time to time.
All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Office and the Loans
and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the
benefit of any such Lending Office. Each Lender may, by written notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate
replacement or additional Lending Offices through which Loans will be made by it
and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

      2.18 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

      Unless Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the
Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment
to the Administrative Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a
Loan or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or
fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does
not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
payment has


                                       35
<PAGE>

been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the
amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption. If such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made
such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall,
on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the
amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day
during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by
the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

      2.19 Intentionally Omitted.

      2.20 Capitalization Covenants.

      2.20.1 Equity Contributions.

            Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders that it has, as of the date hereof, made cash equity
contributions and/or loans to Co-Borrower of not less than $225,000,000, which
funds have been applied prior to the Initial Funding Date solely to pay Approved
Construction Costs (the "First Required Contributions").

      2.20.2 Cost Overruns. Borrower shall fund, from additional equity
contributions to and/or loans by Borrower to Co-Borrower, any cost overruns for
Construction Costs in excess of those set forth in the Approved Construction
Budget.

      2.20.3 Interest Reserve; Blocked Commitment Amount.

            (a) Borrower agrees that it will, on or before May 1, 2002,
establish a segregated account maintained with the Reserve Account Bank pursuant
to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (the "Interest Reserve
Account"), in the name of Borrower and subject to an Account Control Agreement.
Borrower will invest all funds from time to time on deposit in the Interest
Reserve Account solely in Cash Equivalent Investments.

            (b) On or before May 1, 2002, Borrower shall deposit in the Interest
Reserve Account (in immediately available funds) an amount (the "Interest
Reserve Deposit") equal to the product of a (i) the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of the Loans on May 1, 2002, multiplied by (ii) 9.25%,
multiplied by (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is 92 and the denominator
of which is 360. Unless a Default or an Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing, funds deposited in the Interest Reserve Account may be withdrawn by
Co-Borrower from and after May 1, 2002, from time to time as necessary to pay
interest as and when due and payable in respect of the Loans. If a Default or
Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing, Co-Borrower shall not withdraw
any funds from the Interest Reserve Account, and if a Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Administrative Agent (i) shall have the right to give an
Account Control Notice (as defined in the Account Control Agreement) to the
Reserve Account Bank pursuant to the Account Control Agreement and (ii) may
apply or direct the


                                       36
<PAGE>

Reserve Account Bank to apply all funds then on deposit in the Interest Reserve
Account to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section
8.1.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.1, a
portion of the Aggregate Commitment (the "Blocked Commitment Amount") in an
amount sufficient to pay all interest on the Loans from the Effective Date
through July 31, 2002 at an assumed, fixed rate of interest of 9.25% per annum
shall be reserved and shall be available only to fund (i) interest on the Loans
with respect to the period from the Effective Date to May 1, 2002, (ii) the
Interest Reserve Deposit and (iii) the Advance, if any, described in clause (C)
of the next sentence. Advances in respect of the Blocked Commitment Amount shall
be made only (A) directly to the Lenders, in respect of interest on the Loans
for the period from the Effective Date to May 1, 2002, or (B) directly to the
Interest Reserve Account, in respect of the Interest Reserve Deposit or (C) to
Borrower, on May 1, 2002, provided that all interest on the Loans from the
Effective Date to May 1, 2002 has been paid in full and the Interest Reserve
Deposit has been made (or will be made with the proceeds of a simultaneous
Advance). The Blocked Commitment Amount shall be determined and reset in
connection with each borrowing and each repayment of the Loans, as the same are
made.

      2.20.4 Loan Balancing; Completion Reserve. (a) On or prior to the
Effective Date, Borrower has deposited the sum of $44,778,925 in a segregated
account of Borrower maintained with the Reserve Account Bank (the "Completion
Reserve Account"), which account is subject to an Account Control Agreement.
Borrower will invest all funds from time to time on deposit in the Completion
Reserve Account solely in Cash Equivalent Investments. Borrower acknowledges
that the Administrative Agent has not made a final determination as to the
adequacy of the Borrower's initial deposit to the Completion Reserve Account. In
the event the Administrative Agent determines, based on advice of the
Construction Consultant, at any time that the sum of (i) the amounts then on
deposit in the Completion Reserve Account and (ii) the Available Aggregate
Commitment will be insufficient to pay all then unpaid Construction Costs
expected to be incurred through the Completion Date (assuming that construction
of the Project is completed in accordance with the Approved Plans and
Specifications), an "Out-of-Balance Condition" (hereby so defined) shall be
deemed to exist. If an Unmatured Default (other than such Out-of-Balance
Condition) then exists, or occurs while such Out-of-Balance Condition exists, or
if such Out-of-Balance Condition continues for more than 10 consecutive Business
Days after Borrower has received written notice from the Administrative Agent of
such Out-of-Balance Condition (a "Balancing Notice"), the Borrower shall, within
five Business Days after the Administrative Agent's subsequent demand, deposit
into the Completion Reserve Account the amount specified by the Administrative
Agent in the Balancing Notice as necessary to reserve against such deficiency
(each such deposit is herein referred to as a "Balancing Payment") and give
notice to the Administration Agent that such deposit has been made. If and so
long as such Out-of-Balance Condition exists and continues to exist, the Lenders
shall have no obligation to make any further Advances and all Construction Costs
and interest payments on the Loans shall be funded by the Borrower from advances
of funds otherwise provided by the Borrower. Subject to Section 2.20.4(b) hereof
and Section 4(b)(ii) of the Account Control Agreement, unless a Default, an
Unmatured Default or an Out-of-Balance Condition has occurred and is continuing,
funds deposited into the Completion Reserve Account shall be available to be
withdrawn by Borrower in its sole discretion. If a Default or Unmatured Default
or Out-of-Balance Condition has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not
withdraw any


                                       37
<PAGE>

funds from the Completion Reserve Account, and if a Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Administrative Agent (a) shall have the right to give an Account
Control Notice (as defined in the Account Control Agreement) to the Reserve
Account Bank pursuant to the Account Control Agreement and (b) may apply or
direct the Reserve Account Bank to apply all funds then on deposit in the
Completion Reserve Account to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the
provisions of Section 8.1.

                  (b) A $30,000,000 portion (the "Blocked Deposit") of the
amount initially deposited in the Completion Reserve Account shall not be
withdrawn by Borrower and shall be held by the Reserve Account Bank pursuant to
the Account Control Agreement under the sole dominion and control of the
Administrative Agent as additional collateral for the Secured Obligations
unless, on or before the date which is 30 days after the Effective Date, (1)
Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent and the Construction Consultant
AIA forms and progress payment worksheets, properly executed and completed, in
accordance with standard industry practice, and executed by the Project
Architect and Project General Contractor, as applicable, showing payments made,
costs incurred, and costs remaining to complete the Project, on a current basis
and all in form and substance acceptable to the Construction Consultant and the
Administrative Agent, and (2) the Administrative Agent, based on the advice of
the Construction Consultant, has approved the Initial Budget. If the conditions
described in the preceding clauses (1) and (2) are satisfied on or before the
date which is 30 days after the Effective Date, then Administrative Agent shall,
on the same day, give notice thereof (the "Budget Approval Notice") to the
Reserve Account Bank, whereupon the provisions of this Section 2.20.4(b) shall
no longer be effective and the Blocked Deposit shall continue to be held and
disbursed in accordance with all of the other terms and provisions hereof and of
the Account Control Agreement.

      2.20.5 FF&E Reserve. Co-Borrower shall, on or before May 1, 2002,
establish and maintain a segregated account of Co-Borrower with the Reserve
Account Bank, which account (the "FF&E Reserve Account") shall be subject to an
Account Control Agreement, and from and after the Opening Date, Co-Borrower or
Borrower shall deposit into the FF&E Reserve Account, within 45 days after the
last day of each Fiscal Quarter, an amount equal to the Required FF&E Percentage
of the Gross Revenues from the Project for such Fiscal Quarter, and shall insure
that the total deposits into the FF&E Reserve Account for each Operating Year
are not less than the Required FF&E Percentage of the Gross Revenues from the
Project for such Operating Year. Co-Borrower shall invest all funds from time to
time on deposit in the FF&E Reserve Account solely in Cash Equivalent
Investments. Unless a Default or an Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing, funds deposited in the FF&E Reserve Account (the amount on deposit
therein from time to time, the "FF&E Reserve") may be withdrawn by the
Co-Borrower from time to time as necessary to pay for Permitted FF&E
Expenditures as the same are incurred. If a Default or Unmatured Default has
occurred and is continuing, Co-Borrower shall not withdraw any funds from the
FF&E Reserve Account, and if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Administrative Agent (i) shall have the right to give an Account Control Notice
(as defined in the Account Control Agreement) to the Reserve Account Bank
pursuant to the Account Control Agreement and (ii) may apply or direct the
Reserve Account Bank to apply all funds then on deposit in the FF&E Reserve
Account to the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section
8.1.

      2.21 Replacement of Lender. If Borrower is required pursuant to Section
3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender's
obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances into,
Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so
affected an "Affected Lender"), Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to
be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected
Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further
that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which
is reasonably satisfactory to Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree,
as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances and other Obligations due to
the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of
Exhibit F and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to
assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date
and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments,
and (ii) Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day
of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but
unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the
date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the
payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement
under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such
date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.

                                   ARTICLE III

                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

      3.1 Yield Protection. If, on or after the Effective Date, the adoption of
any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy,
guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Office with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

                  (i) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Office to
any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with respect
to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Eurodollar Loans, or

                  (ii) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
Lender or any applicable Lending Office (other than reserves and assessments
taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar
Advances), or

                  (iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to
increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Office of making,
funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans, or reduces any amount receivable by
any Lender or any applicable Lending Office in connection with its Eurodollar
Loans or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending


                                       39
<PAGE>

Office to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Eurodollar
Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such
Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Office of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Office in connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then, within 15
days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction in amount received.

      3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Office of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is
increased as a result of a Change (as defined below in this Section 3.2), then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the
amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the
portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable
to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make
Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital
adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the Effective Date in the
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other
law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
Effective Date which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Office or any corporation controlling
any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital
guidelines in effect in the United States on the Effective Date, including
transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by
regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988
report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices
Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital
Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations
adopted prior to the Effective Date.

      3.3 Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Office would violate
any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the
force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that by reason of changes
affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, (i) deposits of a type and maturity
appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not available or (ii) the
interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not accurately reflect the
cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then the Administrative Agent
shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances until the first date on
which the circumstances causing such suspension cease to exist and require any
affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

      3.4 Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs
on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether
because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not
made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by
the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost
incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any


                                       40
<PAGE>

loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain
such Eurodollar Advance, provided that such indemnity shall not apply to any
such loss or cost incurred solely by reason of an adjustment to any Interest
Period made by the Administrative Agent in connection with syndicating the
Loans.

      3.5 Taxes. (i) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower
shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(b) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and
(d) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original copy of
a receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

                  (ii) In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any
present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect
to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes").

                  (iii) The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts
payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender
and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand
therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

                  (iv) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender")
agrees that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the Effective Date
(or such later date upon which it becomes a Lender hereunder), deliver to each
of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either case
that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, or backup
withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of
such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires
or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding
sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be


                                       41
<PAGE>

required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with
respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax.

                  (v) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed
to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv) above
(unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by the
United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt
from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv), above, the
Borrower shall take such steps (but without material expense to the Borrower) as
such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to
recover such Taxes.

                  (vi) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or
any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall
deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time
or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

                  (vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
(because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because
such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for
any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and
Borrower fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be, as tax, withholding
therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or
Borrower under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related
thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the
Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be, which attorneys may be
employees of the Administrative Agent or Borrower, as the case may be). The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment
of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

      3.6 Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Office with respect
to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender
under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar
Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment
of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a
written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth


                                       42
<PAGE>

in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such
amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence
of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender
funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or
not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower
of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1,
3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

      3.7 Reasonable Efforts to Mitigate. Each Lender shall use its reasonable
best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to minimize any amounts payable by the Borrower under Section 3.1
and Section 3.2 and to minimize any period of illegality under Section 3.3. Each
Lender further agrees to notify the Borrower promptly, but in any event within
30 Business Days, after such Lender learns of the circumstances giving rise to
such a right of payment or such illegality or any circumstances that have
changed such that such right to payment or such illegality, as the case may be,
no longer exists.

                                   ARTICLE IV

      Each of Borrower and Co-Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders

warranties under this Article V are updated, remade or deemed to be remade:

      5.1 Ownership, Existence and Standing. Each of Borrower, Co-Borrower, each
Subsidiary Guarantor and each Creative Group Subsidiary is a corporation,
limited partnership or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated
or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such
concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to
conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
True, correct and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of Borrower,
Co-Borrower, each Subsidiary Guarantor and each Creative Group Subsidiary have
been delivered to the Administrative Agent, each of which is in full force and
effect, has not been modified or amended except to the extent set forth therein
and there are no defaults under such Organizational Documents and, to the best
of Borrower's and Co-Borrower's knowledge, no events exist which, with the
passage of time or giving of notice or both, would constitute a default under
such Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof, the ownership structure of
Borrower, Co-Borrower, Subsidiary Guarantors, the Creative Group Subsidiaries
and all direct and indirect owners of membership interests therein are
completely and accurately disclosed on the ownership chart attached as Schedule
5.1. Neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower is a "foreign person" within the meaning
of Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code.

      5.2 Authorization and Validity. Each of Borrower, Co-Borrower, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Creative Group Subsidiaries has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it
is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery
by each of Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party and the performance of its obligations
thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate or company proceedings.
Each of the Loan Documents to which Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary
Guarantor is a party (A) has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of
Borrower, Co-Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be, (B) to the
extent the same constitutes a security agreement or a collateral document,
creates valid first Liens in the Collateral covered thereby, securing the
payment of all of the Secured Obligations purported to be secured thereby, (C)
assuming due authorization and execution by the Lenders party thereto,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, Co-Borrower
or Subsidiary Guarantors, as the case may be,


                                       50
<PAGE>

enforceable against such Person, in accordance with its terms except to the
extent that the enforcement thereof or the availability of equitable remedies
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity, or by
the discretion of any court of competent jurisdiction in awarding equitable
remedies, regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law and (D) is in full force and effect. All the terms,
provisions, agreements and conditions set forth in the Loan Documents and
required to be performed or complied with by Borrower, Co-Borrower or Subsidiary
Guarantors have been performed or complied with and no Default or breach of any
covenant by any such Person exists thereunder.

      5.3 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery by
the Borrower, Co-Borrower and Subsidiary Guarantors of the Loan Documents to
which any of them is a party, nor the consummation of the transactions therein
contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate (i) any
law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on any such Person or (ii) such Person's articles or certificate of
incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or
certificate of organization, by-laws, or limited liability company operating
agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture,
instrument or agreement to which such Person is a party or is subject, or by
which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default
thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in,
of or on the property of such Person pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval,
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public
body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by
Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantors, is required to be obtained by any of them in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings
under this Agreement, the payment and performance by Borrower, Co-Borrower and
Subsidiary Guarantors of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding
effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.

      5.4 Financial Statements. The respective financial statements of the
Borrower, Co-Borrower, Subsidiary Guarantors and the Creative Group Subsidiaries
heretofore delivered to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in effect on the date such statements were
prepared and fairly present the financial condition and operations of the
Borrower, Co-Borrower, Subsidiary Guarantors and the Creative Group
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, at such date and the results of its operations

knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against the Borrower, Co-Borrower, any

period specified in the preceding clause (1) or, having commenced to contest the

diligence the validity of any such Lien or Claim upon (A) furnishing to the
Title Insurer such security or indemnity as it may require to induce the Title
Insurer to issue

Agent in its reasonable discretion. In addition, as a condition to any such
contest, the Administrative Agent must be satisfied in its sole discretion,
that: (1) any such Lien is being contested, appealed or otherwise prosecuted
with diligence and continuity, (2) enforcement of such Lien shall be stayed
pending such contest, appeal or other proceeding, and (3) the Project is secure

      customarily included under standard so-called "all risk" policies
      including flood, earthquake, vandalism, and malicious mischief, boiler and
      machinery, and such other insurable hazards as, under good insurance
      practices, from time to time are insured against for other property and

      insurance policy shall be endorsed to also provide guaranteed building
      replacement cost to the Improvements (exclusive of excavation and

      law.

            (5) Such other types and amounts of insurance with respect to the
      Project and the operation thereof which are commonly maintained in the
      case of other property and buildings similar to the Project in nature,
      use, location, height, and type of construction, as may from time to time
      be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent.

            (d) All insurance policies (excluding policies in excess of
$50,000,000) required hereunder shall be issued by an insurer or insurers with
an A.M. Best rating of A-VIII or better, and all primary carriers will be

otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in form and
content. Business interruption insurance shall name the Administrative Agent as
Loss Payee. All Property insurance policies also shall include a co-insurance

Borrower nor Property Manager shall carry separate or additional insurance
coverage covering the Improvements concurrent in form or contributing in the
event of loss with that required by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
The Administrative Agent, on reasonable prior notice to Borrower, may examine
the insurance policies (whether in the possession of Borrower or Co-Borrower or

            (e) Borrower and the Property Manager shall pay the premiums for the
insurance policies required hereunder as the same become due and payable.
Borrower and the Property Manager shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
certificates of the insurance policies required to be maintained pursuant to
this Agreement provided, however, the Administrative Agent and Lenders shall not
be deemed by reason of the custody of such certificates to have knowledge of the
contents thereof. Borrower and Co-Borrower also shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days of the Administrative Agent's
request, a certificate of the Borrower and Co-Borrower or their insurance agent
setting forth the particulars as to all such insurance policies. Prior to the
expiration date of each of the insurance policies the Borrower and Co-Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of insurance evidencing
renewal of coverage as required herein.

            (f) Each insurance certificate required hereunder shall contain a
provision whereby the insurer (i) agrees that such policy shall not be canceled,
terminated or reduced in coverage or limits below the coverage and limits of
insurance required by this Agreement, without in each case, at least thirty (30)
days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, (ii) waives any right to
claim any premiums and commissions against the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, provided that the policy need not waive the requirement that the premium
be paid in order for a claim to be paid to the insured and (iii) provides that
the Administrative Agent is permitted to make payments to effect the
continuation of such policy upon notice of cancellation


                                       67
<PAGE>

due to non-payment of premiums. In the event any insurance policy (except for
general public, automobile and other liability and Workers Compensation
insurance or any other similar policies) shall contain breach of warranty
provisions, such policy shall provide that with respect to the interest of the
Administrative Agent and Lenders, such insurance policy shall not be invalidated
by and shall insure the Administrative Agent and Lenders regardless of (A) any
act, failure to act or negligence of or violation of warranties, declarations or
conditions contained in such policy by any named insured, (B) the occupancy or
use of the premises for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms
thereof, or (C) any foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of the Mortgage or any of the
Loan Documents.

            (g) Any insurance maintained pursuant to this Agreement may be
evidenced by blanket insurance policies covering the Project and other
properties or assets of the Borrower and the Property Manager or their
affiliates, provided that any such policy shall in all other respects
substantially fulfill the requirements of this section.

            (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at
any time the Administrative Agent is not in receipt of written evidence that all
insurance required hereunder is maintained in full force and effect, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation), upon ten
(10) days' prior written notice to the Borrower (or such lesser notice as may be
necessary to prevent the lapse of insurance coverage), to take such action as
the Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect its interests in the
Project, including, without limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage
as the Administrative Agent deems appropriate, and all expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with such action will be paid by the Borrower
on demand.

      6.7 Compliance with Laws. Borrower and Co-Borrower shall and Borrower
shall cause all of its Subsidiaries to comply in all material respects with all
Requirements of Law and all restrictive covenants affecting their respective
businesses, Properties, assets and operations, and (b) obtain and maintain as

good standing. Without limiting the foregoing, Co-Borrower shall comply in all
respects with all Environmental Laws with respect to the Project and shall not
suffer or permit the Release or disposal of Contaminants at the Project in any
manner that, in any single instance or in the aggregate, would violate
Environmental Laws.

      6.8 Alterations. With the exception of the Project Construction and change

Agreement, neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower shall, without the prior written

the Project (other than as contemplated by the Approved FF&E Budget) having a
cost in excess of $2,000,000 in any Fiscal Year or (ii) any alterations
affecting the structure or building systems of the Improvements having a cost in
excess of $1,000,000 in any Fiscal Year.

      6.9 Inspections; Books and Records.

            (a) The Administrative Agent, the Construction Consultant, and any
authorized representative(s) designated by either the Administrative Agent or
the Construction


                                       68
<PAGE>

Consultant shall have the right at all reasonable times on reasonable notice
(and (i) for so long as no Default exists, at Borrower's expense provided that
such inspections and examinations do not take place more often than annually,
and otherwise at the expense of the Lenders and (ii) from and after the
occurrence of a Default, at Borrower's expense) and any other Lender shall have
the right at its own expense: (i) to enter upon and inspect the Properties of
Borrower, Co-Borrower and Subsidiary Guarantors (including the Project), both as
part of the Administrative Agent's general oversight (both prior to and after
the Completion Date) and to inspect the Project Construction to determine that
it is in conformity with the Approved Plans and Specifications and all the
requirements hereof; and (ii) to examine, copy and make extracts of the books,
records, accounting data and other documents of the Borrower, Co-Borrower,
Property Manager and Subsidiary Guarantors, whether or not the same relate in
any way to the Project, all of which shall be made available promptly upon the
Administrative Agent's written demand therefor (including in connection with
environmental compliance, hazard or liability), and to discuss the Borrower's,
Co-Borrower's, Subsidiary Guarantors' and other Subsidiaries' and Property
Manager's affairs, finances and accounts, including, but not limited to, matters
relating to the Project, with their respective executive officers, as
applicable, all upon reasonable notice and at such reasonable times during
normal business hours, as often as may be reasonably requested. At the request
of the Administrative Agent, Borrower and the Co-Borrower shall furnish
convenient facilities for the purposes of conducting such investigations and
examinations. No Construction Agreements let or amended by the Co-Borrower shall
be inconsistent with the foregoing inspection and examination rights. It is
expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty
to supervise or to inspect the Project (or any other Property) or any books and
records, that any such inspection shall be for the sole purposes of determining
whether or not the obligations of Borrower and the Co-Borrower under this
Agreement are being properly discharged and of preserving the Administrative
Agent's rights hereunder, and that the Administrative Agent's or Construction
Consultant's failure to inspect or examine any matter shall not constitute a
waiver of any of the Lenders' rights hereunder. If the Administrative Agent, or
the Construction Consultant acting on behalf of the Administrative Agent, should
inspect the Project or any books and records, the Administrative Agent and the
Construction Consultant shall have no liability or obligation to the Borrower,
Co-Borrower or any third party arising out of such inspection (other than any
applicable obligation hereunder with respect to confidentiality) and none of the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any third party shall be entitled to rely upon such
inspection or review. An inspection not followed by notice of default shall not
constitute a waiver of any Unmatured Default or Default then existing, nor shall
it constitute an acknowledgment or representation by the Administrative Agent or
the Construction Consultant that there has been or will be compliance with the
Approved Plans and Specifications and Laws or that the Project is free from
defective materials or workmanship, or a waiver of the Administrative Agent's
right thereafter to insist that the Project be constructed in accordance in all
material respects with the Approved Plans and Specifications and Laws. The
Administrative Agent and the Construction Consultant owe no duty of care to the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any third person to protect against, or inform the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any third person of the existence of, negligent,
faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction of the Project or of any
other Property. The Administrative Agent shall cause the Construction Consultant
to deliver copies of each of its reports with respect to the Project to each of
the Lenders.

Accounting Principles shall be made of all dealings and transactions in relation
to its businesses and activities. If a Default has occurred that is continuing,

turn over copies of any such records to the Administrative Agent or its
representatives.

fixtures and equipment of good quality, all in accordance, in all material
respects, with the Approved Plans and Specifications therefor and all Laws,

theretofore furnished to the Administrative Agent) documents evidencing
satisfaction of the Completion Conditions.

      6.11 Correction of Defects. The Co-Borrower shall proceed with diligence
to investigate and correct all material defects in the Project and any material
departures from the Approved Plans and Specifications which have not been
approved in writing by the Administrative Agent. The disbursement of any
Advances shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent's right to
require compliance with this covenant with respect to any such defect or
departure from the Approved Plans and Specifications or any other requirements
of this Agreement.

      6.12 Changes and Amendments; Monthly Budget Updates. (a) Except for

Administrative Agent in each instance. The Administrative Agent shall not make a
final determination that Co-Borrower has taken any action in contravention of
this Section 6.12 without first notifying Co-Borrower of the matter in question
and giving Co-Borrower ten (10) Business Days within which to refute or contest
such determination.

      6.27 Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds. (a) Borrower and Co-Borrower
hereby direct all insurers under policies of property damage, boiler and
machinery, rental loss, and rental value insurance and payors of any
condemnation claim or award relating to the Project to pay all Property Awards
(net of the cost of reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and other reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such Property Awards) directly to
the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and other Holders of
Secured Obligations, and, in no case to the Borrower or Co-Borrower. In the
event of any loss or damage to any portion of the Project due to a casualty or
condemnation event giving rise to a Property Award ("Property Award Event"), so
long as no Default has occurred that is continuing, the Borrower shall have the
sole right and authority to settle any claim for the Property Award; provided,
however, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to participate in
settlement negotiations with respect to Property Award Events in connection with
the Project which are reasonably likely to result in Property Awards in excess
of $3,000,000 in the aggregate. In the event of the Borrower's and Co-Borrower's
failure to settle any such claim for a Property Award within one hundred eighty
(180) days after the occurrence of the related Property Award Event or if a
Default has occurred that is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to settle all claims for such Property Award on
behalf of the Borrower and Co-Borrower.

            (b) Co-Borrower shall promptly after the occurrence of a Property
Award Event with respect to the Project commence and diligently pursue the
repair, restoration or reconstruction of the damaged portion of the Project and
the opening or reopening and operation of the Project ("Restoration"); provided,
however, that the Borrower shall have prepared and delivered to the
Administrative Agent a budget for such Restoration which is satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

            (c) In the event a Property Award with respect to the Project is
paid to the Administrative Agent, such Property Award shall be made available to
the Borrower for the purpose of Restoration or, in the case of rental loss,
rental value and business interruption insurance, to be applied to debt service
upon the Obligations and for other permitted expenditures with respect to the
Project, subject in each case to the following covenants and conditions:

                  (i) No Default shall have occurred that is continuing.

                  (ii) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days after the occurrence of the related Property Award Event (A)
Co-Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent written evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that, upon completion of the
Restoration, by the expenditure of the Property Award together with any funds
made available by Borrower and Co-Borrower, the Project will be of at least
substantially equal value, quality and character as the Project was immediately
prior to the Property Award Event, free and clear of all Liens except the Liens
in favor of the Administrative Agent and Customary Permitted Liens pertaining
thereto, (B) the Restoration shall be performed in compliance with all then
applicable Laws and with good construction scheduling and good construction
practices and (C) Co-Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for
approval preliminary plans and specifications for the Restoration setting forth
the construction


                                       79
<PAGE>

schedule and budget. Final plans and specifications shall be delivered to the
Administrative Agent for approval promptly upon their completion.

                  (iii) If the Property Award is, in the Administrative Agent's
reasonable judgment, insufficient to complete the Restoration of the Project,
the Borrower and Co-Borrower shall promptly deposit the amount of the
insufficiency in a cash collateral account (the "Restoration Account") in the
name of Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative
Agent and pledged to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders of
Secured Obligations pursuant to agreements satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent. The Borrower and Co-Borrower may not use and, if applicable, the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to release, any Property Awards until
any such additional funds have been expended toward the Restoration and the
budget for such Restoration shall be "in balance" with the funds comprising the
Property Award sufficient to complete the Restoration. If at any time the
Restoration is "out of balance" with the budget and the remaining Property Award
is no longer sufficient to complete such Restoration, then Borrower and
Co-Borrower may not use and, if applicable, the Administrative Agent shall not
be required to further disburse, any portion of the Property Award until such
time as the Administrative Agent has determined, that the remaining Property
Award is sufficient to fully complete the Restoration. For purposes hereof, the
Restoration shall be deemed to be "in balance" only at such time and from time
to time, as the Administrative Agent determines that the Property Award (and any
additional amounts deposited in the Restoration Account with respect to such
Restoration in accordance with the paragraph) equals or exceeds the aggregate
amount of all unpaid costs, fees and expenses necessary for all work in
connection with the final completion of the Restoration, including the costs of
preparing plans and specifications, the "hard" and "soft" costs of the
construction of the base building and Improvements.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent shall be reasonably satisfied
that the Project, when fully restored, will constitute premises suitable for
their intended use of the same or better character and quality as existed prior
to the occurrence of the subject Property Award Event.

                  (v) The Administrative Agent shall have received and approved
all documentation pertaining to the Restoration which has been requested by the
Administrative Agent, including the construction schedule, construction budget,
plans and specifications and any agreements between the Borrower and any Persons
who will perform services or furnish labor or materials in connection with such
Restoration (all such Persons and agreements being subject to the Administrative
Agent's approval).

                  (vi) The Administrative Agent shall have received and approved
Lien waivers, contractor's statements and affidavits reflecting that as of the
date of such disbursement, there are (or immediately after disbursement there
will be) no mechanics' liens (subject to the right to contest said Liens set
forth in this Agreement) or other unpermitted Liens pertaining to title
affecting the damaged Property and the Administrative Agent shall have received
a Date Down Endorsement to the Mortgage Title Insurance Policy confirming the
foregoing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.

                  (vii) The Borrower shall have satisfied such other conditions
and terms as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably require (which shall be
consistent with those that would be imposed by a prudent institutional
construction lender).

Upon the completion of the Restoration to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent, and after paying all reasonable costs and expenses
relating to the subject Property Award Event and related Restoration, the
Administrative Agent shall apply any unexpended balance of the subject Property
Award to prepayment of the Loans. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that no Default exists that is continuing and the
Property Award with respect to a Property Award Event is less than $3,000,000 in
the aggregate, the Administrative Agent shall pay the entire amount of such
proceeds to Co-Borrower promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative
Agent, which proceeds Co-Borrower shall apply for the purposes of Restoration.

            (d) Upon the Borrower's failure to satisfy the covenants and
conditions set forth in clause (b) above with respect to a Property Award Event
constituting loss or damage to all or substantially all of the Project, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right to apply the Property Award to the
Secured Obligations in the order of priority set forth in Section 2.12(b). If
the amount of such Property Award so applied is less than the Secured
Obligations, then a Default shall be deemed to have occurred and the
Administrative Agent shall have all rights and remedies set forth herein, in the
Loan Documents, at law and in equity.

      6.28 The Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' Actions for Their Own
Protection Only. Borrower and Co-Borrower acknowledge and agree that the
authority herein conferred upon the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and
any actions taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to
the Project, to procure waivers or sworn statements, to approve contracts,
subcontracts and purchase orders, to approve plans and specifications, or
otherwise, will be exercised and taken by the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders for their own protection only and may not be relied upon by the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any third party for any purposes whatever; and none of
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, or the Construction Consultant shall be
deemed to have assumed any responsibility to the Borrower, Co-Borrower or any
third party with respect to any such action herein authorized or taken by the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Construction Consultant, or with
respect to the proper construction of improvements on the Project, performance
of contracts, subcontracts or purchase orders by any contractor, subcontractor
or material supplier, or prevention of mechanics' liens from being claimed or
asserted against any portion of the Project. Any review, investigation or
inspection conducted by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Construction
Consultant, any architectural, engineering or other consultants retained by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any Administrative Agent or
representative of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in order to verify
independently Borrower's or Co-Borrower's satisfaction of any conditions
precedent to disbursements under this Agreement, the Borrower's and
Co-Borrower's performance of any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of
the Borrower or Co-Borrower under this Agreement, or the validity of any
representations and warranties made by the Borrower, or Co-Borrower hereunder
(regardless of whether or not the party conducting such review, investigation or
inspection should have discovered that any of such conditions precedent were not
satisfied or that any such covenants, agreements or obligations were not
performed or that any such representations or warranties were not true), shall
not affect (or constitute a waiver


                                       81
<PAGE>

by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of) (i) any of the Borrower's or
Co-Borrower's agreements, covenants, representations and warranties under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or the Lender's reliance thereon or (ii)
the Administrative Agent and Lenders' reliance upon any certifications of the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Project Architect required under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, or any other facts, information or reports
furnished to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders by the Borrower, or
Co-Borrower hereunder.

      6.29 Storage of Property. Co-Borrower shall store all Property in its
possession to be incorporated into or installed at the Project (not as yet
incorporated or installed in the Project) either (i) in such bonded warehouse or
warehouses, which provide sufficient security against damage or pilferage, or
other facilities satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be selected by
Co-Borrower and approved by the Administrative Agent, all charges for such
storage to be paid by Co-Borrower promptly when due so that such Property shall
not at any time become subject to any Lien for such storage charges therefore or
(ii) at the Project, in a manner so as to provide security against damage or
pilferage which shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent and its representatives and the Construction Consultant
will be permitted access to such warehouse(s) and other locations(s) at all
reasonable times on reasonable notice to inspect all such Property. Co-Borrower
shall provide the Administrative Agent with satisfactory evidence that the
insurance required to be obtained hereunder protects such Property from loss or
damage to such items occurring while stored at any such location.

      6.30 Proceedings to Enjoin or Prevent Construction. If any proceedings are
filed seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare unlawful the
construction or the occupancy, maintenance or operation of the Project or any
portion thereof, Borrower and Co-Borrower shall at their sole expense (i) cause
such proceedings to be vigorously contested in good faith and (ii) in the event
of an adverse ruling or decision, prosecute all allowable appeals therefrom.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Co-Borrower shall resist the
entry or seek the stay of any temporary or permanent injunction that may be
entered and use its best efforts to bring about a favorable and speedy
disposition of all such proceedings.

      6.31 No Obligation to Monitor. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Lenders shall have any obligation to monitor or determine the Borrower's or
Co-Borrower's use or application of proceeds of Loans.

      6.32 Compliance with Agreements. Co-Borrower shall comply in all material
respects with its obligations under: (a) all Leases affecting the Project; (b)
the Project Agreements; (c) all agreements with Affiliates; (d) any underlying
covenants, conditions and restrictions of record with respect to the Project;
and (e) all other material contractual obligations relating to the ownership,
operation and maintenance of the Project which are not described in the
foregoing clauses (a) through (d) above. In addition to the foregoing
Co-Borrower shall enforce its material rights and remedies under the agreements
described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (e) above.


                                       82
<PAGE>

      6.33 Organizational Documents. Neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower shall
allow any amendment, modification or other change to any of the terms or
provisions in any of their respective Organizational Documents (or any
Organizational Documents of any of the Subsidiary Guarantors or Creative Group
Subsidiaries) without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
which, in the case of any amendment, modification or other change to the
Organizational Documents of a Subsidiary Guarantor or Creative Group Subsidiary
that is not adverse to the interests of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      6.34 Leasing Provisions. Co-Borrower shall not enter into, terminate,
cancel, amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify any Lease at the Project
without the Administrative Agent's prior written approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, provided that the tenant, if the Administrative Agent
requires it to do so, enters into a subordination, non-disturbance and
attornment agreement in the form required by the Administrative Agent, subject
to reasonable modifications requested by the tenant; provided, that the
Administrative Agent's approval shall not be required (a) for any Lease (or any
amendment, modification, supplement or termination thereof) which (i) demises
less than 5,000 rentable square feet, (ii) is for a term of five years or less
(including any renewal options exercisable by the tenant thereunder) is on
market-rate terms and conditions, and (iii) by its terms is expressly
subordinate to the Mortgage (any such Lease, a "De Minimis Lease") or (b) to
terminate any Lease by reason of a default by the tenant thereunder, provided
that such termination is commercially reasonable. If requested by the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent shall, if it approves any Lease in writing, enter into
a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement with the tenant under
such Lease in the form required by the Administrative Agent, subject to
reasonable modifications requested by the tenant.

      6.35 Ground Lease Covenants. (a) Co-Borrower shall pay when due the rent
and all other sums and charges mentioned in, and payable under, the Hotel Ground
Lease.

            (b) Co-Borrower (i) shall timely perform and observe all of the
terms, covenants and conditions required to be performed and observed by it as
the tenant under the Hotel Ground Lease (including, without limitation, all
payment obligations), (ii) shall do all things necessary to preserve and to keep
unimpaired the Hotel Ground Lease and its leasehold estate and other rights
under the Hotel Ground Lease; (iii) shall not waive, excuse or discharge any of
the obligations of the Ground Lessor under the Hotel Ground Lease without the

diligently and continuously enforce the obligations of the Ground Lessor under
the Hotel Ground Lease.

            (c) Co-Borrower shall not do, permit or suffer (i) any act, event or
omission which would be likely to result in a default or permit the lessor to
terminate or exercise any other remedy under the Hotel Ground Lease or (ii) any
act, event or omission which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time,
or both, would constitute a default or permit the lessor to terminate or
exercise any other remedy under the Hotel Ground Lease.

            (d) Co-Borrower shall not cancel, terminate, surrender, modify or
amend or in any way alter, surrender or permit the alteration of any of the
provisions of either of the Ground


                                       83
<PAGE>

Leases or agree to any termination, amendment, modification or surrender of
either of the Ground Leases without the Administrative Agent's prior written
consent in each instance.

            (e) Co-Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent copies of
all default and other material notices received by Co-Borrower from any party
under the Ground Leases, and of any notice received by Co-Borrower from either
the Ground Lessor or Master Lessor of their intention to terminate the Hotel
Ground Lease or Master Lease, respectively, or to re-enter and take possession
of any premises demised by the Ground Leases, immediately and, in any event,
within one (1) Business Day, of delivery or receipt of any such notice, as the
case may be.

            (f) Co-Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent
copies of such information and evidence as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request concerning Co-Borrower's due observance, performance and
compliance with the terms, covenants and conditions of the Ground Leases.

            (g) Co-Borrower shall not consent to the subordination of the Hotel
Ground Lease or the Master Lease to any mortgage or other lease of the fee
interest or any other leasehold interest in any of the premises demised thereby.

            (h) To the extent it has the right to do so under the terms of the
Ground Leases, Co-Borrower, at its sole cost and expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, within five (5) Business Days after
request, such documents, instruments or agreements as may be required to permit
the Administrative Agent to cure any default under the Ground Leases.

            (i) In the event of a default by Co-Borrower in the performance of
any of its obligations under the Hotel Ground Lease, including, without
limitation, any default in the payment of any sums payable thereunder, then, in
each and every case, the Administrative Agent may, at its option, cause the
default or defaults to be remedied and otherwise exercise any and all rights of
Co-Borrower thereunder in the name of and on behalf of Co-Borrower. Co-Borrower
shall, on demand, reimburse the Administrative Agent for all expenses incurred
by the Administrative Agent in curing any such default (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements), together with interest thereon
computed at the Default Rate from the date that such expense is incurred, to and
including the date the same is paid to the Administrative Agent.

            (j) Co-Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice
of its intention to exercise each and every option, if any, to renew or extend
the term of the Hotel Ground Lease, at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the time to exercise such option under the terms thereof. If
required by the Administrative Agent, Co-Borrower shall duly exercise any
renewal or extension option with respect to the Hotel Ground Lease. If
Co-Borrower intends to renew or extend the term of the Hotel Ground Lease, it
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent with the notice of such decision, a
copy of the notice of renewal or extension delivered to the Ground Lessor,
together with the terms and conditions of such renewal or extension. Co-Borrower
hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact,
coupled with an interest, to execute and deliver, for and in the name of such
Co-


                                       84
<PAGE>

Borrower, all instruments and agreements necessary under the Hotel Ground Lease
or otherwise to cause any renewal or extension of the Hotel Ground Lease.

            (k) In the event that the Hotel Ground Lease shall be terminated by
reason of a default beyond any applicable cure period thereunder by Co-Borrower,
and the Administrative Agent shall require from the Ground Lessor a Novation
Ground Lease (as such term is defined in the Hotel Ground Lease), Co-Borrower
hereby waives any right, title and interest in and to such Novation Ground Lease
and the leasehold estate created thereby, together with all rights of redemption
now or hereafter operable under any law.

            (l) Co-Borrower shall not elect to treat the Hotel Ground Lease as
terminated, canceled or surrendered pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code (including, without limitation, Section 365(h)(1) thereof)
without the Administrative Agent's prior written consent in the event of the
bankruptcy of, or any similar proceedings with respect to, the Ground Lessor.
Co-Borrower shall, in the event of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings with
respect to the Ground Lessor, reaffirm and ratify the legality, validity,
binding effect and enforceability of the Hotel Ground Lease within the
applicable time period therefor in such proceedings, notwithstanding any
rejection thereof by the Ground Lessor or any trustee, custodian or receiver.

            (m) Co-Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent not less than
thirty (30) days prior written notice of the date on which Co-Borrower shall
apply to any court or other governmental authority for authority and permission
to reject the Hotel Ground Lease in the event that there shall be filed by or
against Borrower any petition, action or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or
under any other similar federal or state law now or hereafter in effect and if
Co-Borrower determines to reject the Hotel Ground Lease. The Administrative
Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to serve upon Co-Borrower
within such thirty (30) day period a notice stating that (i) the Administrative
Agent demands that Co-Borrower assume and assign the Hotel Ground Lease to the
Administrative Agent subject to and in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, and
(ii) the Administrative Agent covenants to cure or provide reasonably adequate
assurance thereof with respect to all defaults reasonably susceptible of being
cured by the Administrative Agent and of future performance under the Hotel
Ground Lease. If the Administrative Agent serves upon Co-Borrower the notice
described above, Co-Borrower shall not seek to reject the Hotel Ground Lease and
shall comply with the demand provided for clause (i) above within ten (10) days
after the notice shall have been given by the Administrative Agent.

            (n) During the continuance of a Default, the Administrative Agent
shall have the right, but not the obligation, (i) to perform and comply with all
obligations of Co-Borrower under the Hotel Ground Lease without regard to any
grace period provided therein, (ii) to do and take, without any obligation to do
so, such action as the Administrative Agent deems necessary or desirable to
prevent or cure any default by Co-Borrower under the Hotel Ground Lease,
including, without limitation, any act, deed, matter or thing whatsoever that
Borrower may do in order to cure a default under the Hotel Ground Lease and
(iii) to enter in and upon the Project or any part thereof to such extent and as
often as the Administrative Agent deems necessary or desirable in order to
prevent or cure any default of Co-Borrower under the Hotel Ground Lease.
Co-Borrower shall, within five (5) days after written request is made therefor
by the Administrative Agent, execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent or
to any party designated by the Administrative Agent, such further instruments,
agreements, powers,


                                       85
<PAGE>

assignments, conveyances or the like as may be reasonably necessary to complete
or perfect the interest, rights or powers of the Administrative Agent pursuant
to this paragraph or as may otherwise by required by the Administrative Agent.

            (o) In the event of any arbitration under or pursuant to any of the
Ground Leases in which the Administrative Agent elects to participate,
Co-Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact (which appointment shall be deemed coupled with an
interest) to exercise, all right, title and interest of Co-Borrower in
connection with such arbitration, including, without limitation, the right to
appoint arbitrators and to conduct arbitration proceedings on behalf of
Co-Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All costs and expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with such arbitration and the settlement
thereof shall be borne solely by Co-Borrower, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements. Nothing contained in this
paragraph shall obligate the Administrative Agent to participate in any such
arbitration.

            (p) The Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to proceed in respect of any claim, suit, action or proceeding
relating to the rejection of any of the Ground Leases by the ground lessor as a
result of bankruptcy or similar proceedings in respect of such ground lessor,
including, without limitation, the right to file and prosecute any and all
proofs of claims, complaints, notices and other documents in any such bankruptcy
case or similar proceeding.

            (q) Co-Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent within ten
(10) days after receipt of written demand from the Administrative Agent, an
estoppel certificate in relation to each Ground Lease setting forth (i) the name
of the lessee and the lessor thereunder, (ii) that such Ground Lease is in full
force and effect and has not been modified or, if it has been modified, the date
of each modification (together with copies of each such modification), (iii) the
annual rent and additional rent payable under such Ground Lease, (iv) the date
to which all rental charges have been paid by the lessee under such Ground
Lease, (v) whether any notice of default has been received by Co-Borrower and if
such notice has been received, the date it was received and the nature of the
default, (vi) whether there are any alleged defaults of Co-Borrower under such
Ground Lease, and, if there are, setting forth the nature thereof in reasonable
detail, and (vii) if Co-Borrower is in default under the terms of any Ground
Lease or if any facts or circumstances exist, which with the passage of time or
the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default under any of the Ground
Leases, setting forth in detail the nature of such default, fact or
circumstance.

            (r) To the extent of its rights under either of the Ground Leases,
Co-Borrower shall obtain and deliver to the Administrative Agent within thirty
(30) days after written demand by the Administrative Agent, an estoppel
certificate in relation to such Ground Lease from the ground lessor thereunder
setting forth (i) the name of the lessee and the lessor thereunder, (ii) that
the Ground Lease is in full force and effect and has not been modified or, if it
has been modified, the date of each modification (together with copies of each
such modification), (iii) the annual rent and additional rent payable under the
Ground Lease, (iv) the date to which all rental charges have been paid by the
lessee under the Ground Lease, (v) whether a notice of default has been received
by the ground lessor which has not been cured, and if such notice has been
received, the date it was received and the nature of the default, (vi) whether
there are any alleged


                                       86
<PAGE>

defaults of the lessee under the Ground Lease and, if there are, setting forth
the nature thereof in reasonable detail, and (vii) if the lessee under the
Ground Lease shall be in default, the default.

      6.36 Zoning Changes. Neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower shall cause, permit,
acquiesce in, or consent to any changes or modifications to the zoning and land
use ordinances or other Requirements of Law affecting the Project if such
changes or modifications would adversely affect (i) the ability of Co-Borrower
to construct the Project in accordance with the Approved Plans and
Specifications or operate the Project as intended or (ii) the value of the
Project. Co-Borrower shall give to the Administrative Agent notice of any
material change in zoning and land use ordinances and other Requirements of
Lease affecting the Project promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof.

      6.37 Fiscal Year. Neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower shall change, and
Borrower shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor or Creative Group Subsidiary
to change, its fiscal year for accounting or tax purposes from the Fiscal Year
without obtaining the written consent of the Required Lenders.

      6.38 Cooperation with Construction Consultant. Co-Borrower shall provide
the items described on Schedule 6.38 to the Construction Consultant on a current
basis as the same are available from time to time in order to permit the
Construction Consultant to render periodic reports to the Lenders with respect
to the status of Project Construction.

      6.39 Security Interest in Accounts; Certain Remedies. (a) Borrower and
Co-Borrower covenant and agree not to maintain, and not to permit the Property
Manager to maintain with respect to the Project, any bank accounts, investment
accounts or other accounts other than the Interest Reserve Account, the FF&E
Reserve Account, Completion Reserve Account and the Restoration Account (all of
which shall be maintained by Co-Borrower or Borrower, as applicable, and not by
the Property manager) and the other accounts identified in Schedule 6.39 hereto
(collectively, the "Accounts"). To secure the payment and performance of the
Secured Obligations, Borrower and Co-Borrower hereby pledge and assign to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of itself and the Lenders and other Holders
of Secured Obligations all of the Borrower's and Co-Borrower's right, title and
interest in, and hereby grant to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
itself and the Lenders and other Holders of the Secured Obligations a security
interest in and right of set-off against, and, without limiting the foregoing,
the right (exercisable only after the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default) to direct the holders of the Accounts to set-off against and
immediately to turn over to the Administrative Agent: (i) the Accounts; (ii) all
cash, instruments, securities, investments and other property from time to time
transferred or credited to, contained in or comprising the Accounts or any of
them; (iii) all statements, certificates, passbooks and instruments representing
the Accounts or any of them; (iv) any and all substitutions or additions of or
with respect to any of the foregoing; and (v) any and all proceeds and products
of any of the foregoing, whether now owned and existing or hereafter acquired or
arising, including, without limitation (A) interest, principal, dividends and
other amounts or distributions received with respect to any of the foregoing and
(B) property received from the sale, exchange or other disposition of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Account Collateral"). Borrower and Co-Borrower
shall cause the Property Manager and the holders of the Accounts (the "Account
Holders") to execute and deliver notices and acknowledgments of the
Administrative Agent's security interest in the Accounts, in form and


                                       87
<PAGE>

substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, prior to the Initial Funding
Date or upon establishing each Account, as applicable. Borrower and Co-Borrower
agree from time to time, at their expense, to execute and deliver and promptly
cause to be filed in the appropriate public offices UCC financing statements and
all further instruments and documents, and to take all further action which
Administrative Agent may reasonably request and which are necessary or desirable
in the opinion of Administrative Agent or its counsel in order to create,
preserve, perfect and protect any security interests granted or purported to be
granted hereby and enable Administrative Agent to exercise and enforce its
rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Account Collateral. Borrower
and Co-Borrower hereby authorize Administrative Agent to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, and authorize
Administrative Agent to take all such further action and execute all such
further documents and instruments as may be reasonably necessary or desirable in
order to create, preserve, perfect and protect the security interest granted
hereby, without the signature of the Borrower or where permitted by law.
Whenever applicable law requires the signature of Borrower or Co-Borrower on a
document to be filed to preserve, perfect or protect the security interest
granted hereby, Borrower and Co-Borrower hereby appoint Administrative Agent as
their respective attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to sign
their names (or the names of any of them) on any such document. Borrower and
Co-Borrower hereby agree that a photocopy or other reproduction of this
Agreement or any financing statement covering the Account Collateral or any part
thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law.
Neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower shall further pledge, assign or grant a
security interest in the Account Collateral or any part thereof or permit any
other lien to attach thereto or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1
financing statement (except those naming Administrative Agent as secured party)
to be filed with respect thereto.

            (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default,
the Administrative Agent shall, in addition to all remedies conferred upon it
and the Lenders by law and by the terms of the Loan Documents, have the right,
but not the obligation, without notice to the Borrower or Co-Borrower, except as
required by law, and at any time or from time to time to charge, set-off and
otherwise apply all or any portion of the Account Collateral against the Secured
Obligations and direct the disbursement thereof to the Administrative Agent. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be irrevocably
authorized to direct the Account Holders to withdraw or transfer the Account
Collateral from the Accounts and deposit or deliver the same into an account of,
or designated by, the Administrative Agent in its sole and absolute discretion.
The Account Holders shall be irrevocably authorized to comply with any and all
directions so given by the Administrative Agent.

            (c) In addition to (and not in limitation of) all other rights or
remedies granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to the
Loan Documents, Borrower and Co-Borrower hereby grant the Account Holders, their
Affiliates and the Administrative Agent, in each case for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, a contractual right of set-off against
each of the Accounts and all of the Account Collateral.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.39,
after a Default has occurred and during the continuance thereof, the
Administrative Agent may, at its sole and absolute discretion, (A) elect to
apply the Account Collateral in whole or in part to pay Project expenditures,


                                       88
<PAGE>

including expenditures relating to Project Construction, (B) elect to have all
or any portion of the Account Collateral disbursed to a receiver appointed by a
court of competent jurisdiction and thereafter held and disbursed by such
receiver in accordance with the Administrative Agent's directions; and/or (C)
elect to apply all or any part of the Account Collateral to the Secured
Obligations in such order and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall
determine in its sole and absolute discretion.

            (e) The Administrative Agent may also exercise in respect of the
Account Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein
or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party
under the UCC, and the Administrative Agent may, without notice except as
specified below, sell the Account Collateral or any part thereof in one or more
parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent's offices
or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other
terms as the Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Borrower and
Co-Borrower shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, at the
Borrower's and Co-Borrower's, expense, execute and deliver, all such instruments
and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may
be reasonably necessary or, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent or its
counsel, advisable to make such sale of the Account Collateral or any part
thereof valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law. Borrower and
Co-Borrower agree that ten (10) days' notice of the time and place of any public
sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
reasonable notification. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make
any sale of the Account Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been
given. The Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may,
without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned.

            (f) BORROWER AND CO-BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO
NOTICE AND HEARING OF ANY KIND PRIOR TO THE EXERCISE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
OF ITS RIGHTS TO REPOSSESS THE ACCOUNT COLLATERAL WITHOUT JUDICIAL PROCESS OR TO
REPLEVY, ATTACH OR LEVY UPON SUCH COLLATERAL WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR HEARING.

            (g) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.39,
after a Default has occurred and during the continuance thereof, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for and to obtain appointment of a receiver of the Account
Collateral as a matter of strict right, to take possession of the Account
Collateral, and to apply and disburse the same in accordance with this
Agreement.

            (h) To the full extent that they may lawfully so agree, Borrower and
Co-Borrower agree that they shall not at any time plead, claim or take the
benefit of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or
redemption law now or hereafter in force to prevent or delay the enforcement of
this Agreement, the Loan Documents or the absolute sale of any portion of or all
of the Account Collateral or any portion of the Project, or the possession of
any of the foregoing by any purchaser at any sale under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, and Borrower and Co-Borrower, each for itself and all who
may claim under Borrower or Co-Borrower to the full extent that Borrower or
Co-Borrower now or hereafter lawfully may do so, hereby each waives the benefit
of all such laws.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

      8.1 Acceleration.

            (a) If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with
respect to the Borrower, Co-Borrower, Property Manager or any Subsidiary
Guarantor, the Aggregate Commitment and the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the
Administrative Agent shall upon the direction of, and may, with the consent of,
Required Lenders terminate or suspend the Aggregate Commitment and the
obligations of the Lenders to


                                       93
<PAGE>

make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both,
whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower
and Co-Borrower hereby expressly waive.

            (b) The Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time
while any Default exists and is continuing apply any funds deposited in any of
the Accounts to the payment of the Secured Obligations and any other amounts as
shall from time to time have become due and payable by Borrower or Co-Borrower
to the Lenders under the Loan Documents.

            (c) At any time while any Default is continuing, neither the
Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the Borrower shall have
any right to withdraw any of the funds held in any Account. After all of the
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Aggregate Commitment has
been terminated, any funds remaining in the Accounts shall be returned by the
Administrative Agent to Borrower or Co-Borrower or paid to whomever may be
legally entitled thereto at such time.

            (d) If, after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or
termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder as a
result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
with respect to Borrower or Co-Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for
the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the
Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

      8.2 All Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have all rights and
remedies set forth herein, in the Loan Documents, at law and in equity and the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to pursue one or more of such rights and remedies concurrently or
successively, it being the intent hereof that all such rights and remedies shall
be cumulative, and that no remedy shall be to the exclusion of any other.

      8.3 Construction. In addition to and without limiting any of its rights
and remedies available hereunder, under the other Loan Documents, at law or in
equity, and without constituting an election of remedies, upon the occurrence
and continuance of any Default, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may (i)
complete the construction of the Project or any part thereof and take any other
action whatever which, in the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' sole
judgment, is necessary to fulfill the covenants, agreements and obligations of
Borrower and Co-Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
including the right to avail themselves of and procure performance of existing
Construction Agreements and Project Agreements and (ii) let any contracts with
the same contractors and subcontractors or others and to employ watchmen to
protect the Project or any part thereof from injury. Without restricting the
generality of the foregoing, and for the purpose aforesaid, each of Borrower and
Co-Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes the Administrative Agent its lawful
attorney in fact with full power of substitution and agrees that the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to: (A) complete the construction of the
Project or any part thereof; (B) use any Balancing Payments, funds in the
Restoration Account, Completion Reserve Account or any other Account or
unadvanced funds remaining in the Aggregate Commitment or which may be reserved,
escrowed or set aside for any purpose whatever at any time, to complete the
construction of the Project or


                                       94
<PAGE>

any part thereof; (C) advance funds in excess of the amount of any or all the
Loans to complete the construction of the Project; (D) make changes in the
Approved Plans and Specifications which shall be necessary or desirable to
complete the construction of the Project in substantially the manner
contemplated by the Approved Plans and Specifications; (E) retain or employ such
new general contractors, contractors, subcontractors, architects, engineers and
inspectors as may be required for said purposes; (F) pay, settle or compromise
all existing bills and claims, the nonpayment of which might result in Liens on
the Project or any part thereof, or prevent such bills and claims from resulting
in Liens against the Project or any part thereof or against fixtures,
furnishing, furniture or equipment or other Property, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the construction and equipping and furnishing of
the Project or any part thereof or for the clearance of title; (G) execute all
applications and certificates which may be required by any of the Loan
Documents; (H) prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings connected with or
relating to the Project or any part thereof; (I) take such action and require
such performance as the Administrative Agent deems necessary under any payment
and performance bonds, and make settlements and compromises with the surety or
sureties thereunder, and, in connection therewith, execute instruments of
release and satisfaction; (J) take possession of and operate the Project or any
part thereof; and (K) do any and every act which Borrower or Co-Borrower might
do in its own behalf, it being understood and agreed that the foregoing power of
attorney shall be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.

      8.4 Enforcement. Borrower and Co-Borrower each acknowledges that in the
event the Borrower or Co-Borrower fails to perform, observe or discharge any of
its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders; therefore, the Borrower and Co-Borrower each agrees that the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving
actual damages.

      8.5 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein, and the making of an Advance notwithstanding the existence of a Default
or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such
Advance shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation
of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be
valid unless in writing signed by the Administrative Agent, and then only to the
extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the
Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid
in full.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

      9.1 Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties made
herein and all obligations, covenants and agreements of Borrower and/or
Co-Borrower in respect of taxes, indemnification and expense reimbursement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the making and repayment of the Advances and the termination of this
Agreement and shall not be limited in any way by the passage of time or
occurrence of any event and shall expressly cover time periods when the
Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may have come into possession or
control of any Property of Borrower.

      9.2 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the
Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation unless the same has resulted from the failure
of such Lender to comply with any requirements imposed upon such Lender by
applicable Law.

      9.3 Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience
of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the
provisions of the Loan Documents.

      9.4 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
understanding among Borrower, Co-Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among Borrower,
Co-Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject
matter thereof.

      9.5 Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective obligations of
the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the
partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform any of
its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. Borrower and Co-Borrower are jointly and severally liable
and obligated for each other's obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not
be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that the Joint Book Running
Managers, Co-Lead Arrangers, Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent (each, an
Initial Lender Affiliate, and collectively, the "Initial Lender Affiliates")
shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10, 10.10, 10.18
and 10.20 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right
to enforce such provisions on their own behalf and in their own names to the
same extent as if each were a party to this Agreement.

      9.6 Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Borrower and Co-Borrower shall
reimburse the Administrative Agent, and the Co-Lead Arrangers for any costs and
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) paid or incurred
by the Administrative Agent or the Co-Lead Arrangers (but excluding overhead and
internal costs) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery, syndication, review, amendment, modification, and


                                       96
<PAGE>

administration of the Loan Documents (other than (i) legal fees and related
disbursements incurred by the Lenders in connection with any amendments to the
Loan Documents requested by the Lenders after the Effective Date to facilitate
the syndication of the Commitments and the Loans, which legal fees and
disbursements shall be borne by the Lenders in proportion to their Pro Rata
Shares and (ii) the fees and expenses of the Construction Consultant, which
shall be borne solely by the Administrative Agent), in connection with
disbursements hereunder and otherwise with respect to the Project. Borrower also
agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, Co-Lead Arrangers and the Lenders
for any costs and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, Co-Lead Arrangers
and the Lenders, but excluding internal administrative overhead except for legal
fees hereafter referred to in this sentence) paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent, Co-Lead Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys may be
employees of the Administrative Agent, Co-Lead Arrangers or any Lender in
connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents in the
event of a Default. Expenses required to be reimbursed by Borrower and
Co-Borrower under this Section include, without limitation, the cost and expense
of obtaining Appraisals of the Project, provided that so long as no Default
shall exist that is continuing Borrower shall not be required to pay for
Appraisals other than (i) the initial Appraisal by CB Richard Ellis obtained by
the Administrative Agent prior to the Effective Date and (ii) a single further
Appraisal which the Administrative Agent may commission in its sole discretion.

            (b) Borrower and Co-Borrower hereby further agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Initial Lender Affiliates, each Lender, their
respective Affiliates, and each of their agents, shareholders, directors,
officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties,
judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses
of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent,
any Initial Lender Affiliate, any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto)
which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby (including
without limitation the Project Construction and any claims for personal injury,
property damage, economic loss, violation of Law, mechanics Liens, and patent,
trademark or copyright infringement) or the direct or indirect application or
proposed application of the proceeds of any Advance hereunder except to the
extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The obligations of Borrower
under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

      9.7 Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents, and
requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to each
of the Lenders.

      9.8 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting
terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations
hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.

      9.9 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is
held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as
to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that


                                       97
<PAGE>

jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in
any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are
declared to be severable.

      9.10 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower and
Co-Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the
other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the
Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender Affiliate, or any Lender shall have any
fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary
Guarantor. None of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender Affiliate, or
any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower, Co-Borrower or any
Subsidiary Guarantor to review or inform the Borrower, Co-Borrower or any
Subsidiary Guarantor of any matter in connection with any phase of the
Borrower's or Co-Borrower's business or operations. Borrower and Co-Borrower
agree that none of the Administrative Agent, any Initial Lender Affiliate, or
any Lender shall have liability to Borrower or Co-Borrower (whether sounding in
tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by Borrower or Co-Borrower in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions
contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act,
omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in
a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party
from which recovery is sought. None of the Administrative Agent, any Initial
Lender Affiliate, or any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and
the Borrower and Co-Borrower hereby waive, release and agree not to sue for, any
special, indirect or consequential damages suffered by Borrower, Co-Borrower or
any Subsidiary Guarantor in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

      9.11 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Borrower or Co-Borrower or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement in confidence,
except for disclosure (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders and their
respective Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other
professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee or prospective
Transferee, (iii) to regulatory officials, (iv) to any Person as requested
pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or legal process, (v) to any
Person in connection with any legal proceeding to which such Lender is a party,
(vi) to such Lender's direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap or
similar agreements or to legal counsel, accountants and other professional
advisors to such counterparties, and (vii) permitted by Section 12.4.

      9.12 Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying on
or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Advances
provided for herein.

      9.13 Disclosure. Borrower and Co-Borrower and each Lender hereby (i)
acknowledge and agree that Bankers Trust Company, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.
and/or their respective Affiliates from time to time may hold investments in,
make other loans to or have other relationships with Borrower, Co-Borrower and
any of their Affiliates, and (ii) waive any liability of Bankers Trust Company,
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. and/or their respective Affiliates to the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Lender, respectively, arising out of or resulting
from such investments, loans or relationships.

      9.14 Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all
of the Secured Obligations. To the extent that the Borrower or Co-Borrower makes
a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any such
Person receives payment from the proceeds of the Collateral or exercises its
rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such
enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared
to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a
trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such recovery, the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens,
right and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and
effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had
not occurred.

      9.15 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors
and permitted assigns of the Lenders. The rights hereunder of the Borrower and
Co-Borrower and any interest therein, may not be assigned without the written
consent of all Lenders, which may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion
of each.

      9.16 Inconsistencies. This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents
shall be construed to the extent reasonable to be consistent one with the other,
but to the extent that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are actually
inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document, this
Agreement shall govern. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the existence of (and the Lenders' review of), the Organizational
Documents or any Project Agreements shall not be deemed to be an approval by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders of any of the actions that may be permitted
to be taken by Borrower, Co-Borrower or any other Person thereunder to the
extent such actions violate the terms hereof. In addition to the foregoing, none
of the terms or provisions hereof shall be deemed to be waived or modified by
virtue of the fact that such terms and provisions conflict with, or contradict,
any of the terms and provisions of the Organizational Documents or any Project
Agreements.

      9.17 Disclaimer by Lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be liable to any contractor,
subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer, tenant or other party for
services performed or materials supplied in connection with any work performed
at the Project or any other Property. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be liable for any debts or claims
accruing in favor of any such parties against Borrower, Co-Borrower or others or
against any Property. Neither Borrower nor Co-Borrower shall be an agent of
either the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any Initial Lender Affiliate
for any purposes and neither the Lenders nor the Administrative Agent nor any
Initial Lender Affiliate shall be deemed partners or joint venturers with
Borrower, Co-Borrower or any other Person. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
the Lenders nor any Initial Lender Affiliate shall be deemed to be in privity of
contract with any contractor or provider of services to the Project, nor shall
any payment of funds directly to a contractor or subcontractor or provider of
services be deemed to create any third party beneficiary status or recognition
of same by either the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any Initial Lender
Affiliate, and Borrower and Co-Borrower each agrees


                                       99
<PAGE>

to hold the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Initial Lender Affiliates
harmless from any of the damages and expenses resulting from such a construction
of the relationship of the parties or any assertion thereof.

      9.18 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of each and every term
and provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      9.19 Protective Advances. The Administrative Agent may from time to time,
before or after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, subject
to the prior written approval of the Required Lenders, make such disbursements
and advances pursuant to the Loan Documents (which disbursements and advances
shall be deemed to be "Loans" made hereunder) which the Administrative Agent, in
its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or desirable to preserve or protect
the Collateral or any portion thereof or to enhance the likelihood or maximize
the amount of repayment of the Secured Obligations ("Protective Advances"). The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender in writing of
each such Protective Advance, which notice (each a "Protective Advance Notice")
shall include a description of the purpose of such Protective Advance, the
aggregate amount of such Protective Advance, each Lender's Pro Rata Share
thereof and the date each Lender shall be required to pay its Pro Rata Share of
the Protective Advance (the "Protective Advance Date"), which Protective Advance
Date shall be not less than two (2) Business Days after delivery of the
Protective Advance Notice. Each Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
its Pro Rata Share of any Protective Advance on the Protective Advance Date in
the manner set forth herein for a funding of an Advance. Borrower agrees to pay
the Administrative Agent, upon demand, the principal amount of all outstanding
Protective Advances, together with interest thereon at the rate set forth in
Section 2.11 applicable in the event of a Default. If Borrower fails to make
payment in respect of any Protective Advance within three (3) Business Days
after the date Borrower receives written demand therefor from the Administrative
Agent, such failure shall constitute a Default. All outstanding principal of,
and interest on, Protective Advances shall constitute Secured Obligations
secured by the Collateral until paid in full by Borrower. Upon the making of a
Protective Advance, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to any and all
rights, equal or superior titles, liens and equities, owned or claimed by any
owner or holder of said outstanding liens, charges and indebtedness, however
remote, regardless of whether said liens, charges and indebtedness are acquired
by assignment or have been released of record by the holder thereof upon
payment.

                                    ARTICLE X

                    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

      10.1 Appointment. The Lenders hereby designate Bankers Trust Company as
Administrative Agent to act as specified herein and in the other Loan Documents.
Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Note by the
acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other instruments and
agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to
perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such
other powers as are reasonably incidental


                                      100
<PAGE>

thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or
through its respective officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

      10.2 Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and in
the other Loan Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
respective officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan
Documents or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of the
Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the
Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder of
any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, expressed or
implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the
Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

      10.3 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. (a) Independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the holder of
each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to
make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of the Borrower, Co-Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors in connection
with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of
any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the
creditworthiness of such Persons and, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder
of any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether
coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or
times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information,
representations or warranties herein or in any other Loan Document or in any
document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or
therewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the financial condition of Borrower,
Co-Borrower, or the Subsidiary Guarantors , or be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions
or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the financial
condition of the Credit Parties or the existence or possible existence of any
Default or Unmatured Default.

            (b) The Administrative Agent does not represent, warrant or guaranty
to the Lenders the performance of the Borrower, Co-Borrower, any Subsidiary
Guarantor, any architect, any project managers, any contractor, subcontractor or
provider of materials or services in connection with the construction of the
Project and Borrower and Co-Borrower shall remain solely responsible for all
aspects of the Projects, including but not limited to the quality and
suitability of the Plans and Specifications, the supervision of the work of
construction, the qualifications, financial condition and performance of all
architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, consultants and
property managers, the accuracy of all applications for payment, and the proper
application of all Loans.

      10.4 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative
Agent shall request instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any
act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain
from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent
shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and the
Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so
refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or holder of any Note
shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a
result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or
under any other Loan Document in accordance with the instructions of the
Required Lenders.

      10.5 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice,
statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram,
radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by
any Person that the Administrative Agent in good faith believed to be the proper
Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and
any other Loan Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of
counsel selected by the Administrative Agent (which may be counsel for Borrower
or Co-Borrower).

      10.6 Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify
the Administrative Agent, in proportion to their respective "percentages" as
used in determining the Required Lenders, for and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions,
judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which
may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in
performing its respective duties hereunder or under any other Loan Document, in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

      10.7 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to
its obligation to make Loans under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent
shall have the rights and powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may
exercise the same rights and powers as though it were not performing the duties
specified herein; and the term "Lenders," "Required Lenders," "holders of Notes"
or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates,
include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative
Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind
of Lendering, investment Lendering, trust or other business with Borrower,
Co-Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Affiliate of any such Person as if
it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from any such Person for services in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and otherwise without having to account for
the same to the Lenders.

      10.8 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written
notice of the assignment,


                                      102
<PAGE>

transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with
the Administrative Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person who,
at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is the
holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder,
transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the case may be, of such Note or of any
Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

      10.9 Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent
may resign from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or
under the other Loan Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior
written notice to Borrower and the Lenders. Such resignation shall take effect
upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to clauses (b)
and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.

            (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by the Administrative Agent,
the Borrower shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or
thereunder who shall be a commercial Lender or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Required Lenders (it being understood and agreed that any
Lender is deemed to be acceptable to the Required Lenders), provided that, if a
Default or an Unmatured Default exists at the time of such resignation, the
Required Lenders shall appoint such successor Administrative Agent.

            (c) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so
appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the
consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall serve as
Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any, as the
Borrower or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided above.

            (d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant
to clause (b) or (c) above by the 30th Business Day after the date such notice
of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's
resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall thereafter
perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any
other Loan Document until such time, if any, as the Borrower or the Required
Lenders, as the case may be, appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided above.

      10.10 Other Agents. None of the Co-Lead Arrangers nor the Joint Book
Running Managers nor the Syndication Agent nor the Documentation Agent shall
have any liabilities or obligations hereunder in their respective capacities as
such.

      10.11 Lender Default. If any Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") fails to fund
its Pro Rata Share of any Advance on or before the time required pursuant to
this Agreement, or fails to fund its Pro Rata Share of any amount due under
Section 10.14(d) or the last sentence of Section 10.12 on or before the time
required thereunder or fails to pay the Administrative Agent, within twenty (20)
days of demand (which demand shall be accompanied by invoices or other
reasonable back up information demonstrating the amount owed), such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of any out-of-pocket costs, expenses or disbursements incurred or
made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the
aggregate amount which the Defaulting


                                      103
<PAGE>

Lender fails to pay or fund is referred to as the "Default Amount"), then, in
addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to the Non-Defaulting
Lenders at law and in equity:

            (a) The Defaulting Lender's right to participate in the
administration of the Obligations and the Loan Documents, including without
limitation, any rights to vote upon, consent to or direct any action of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall be suspended and such rights shall not
be reinstated unless and until such default is cured, provided, however, that if
the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall
continue to have all rights provided for in this Agreement and the Loan
Agreement with respect to the administration of the Loan, unless the Required
Lenders vote to remove and replace the Administrative Agent, in which event the
Required Lenders shall notify the Administrative Agent, Borrower and the other
Lenders of the identity of the successor Administrative Agent so chosen by the
Required Lenders and such successor Administrative Agent shall assume all the
rights and duties of Administrative Agent hereunder as of the date such notice
is given;

            (b) If and to the extent the Default Amount includes an amount
which, if advanced by the Defaulting Lender, would be applied to interest, fees
or other amounts due to the Lenders under the Loan Documents (such portion of
the Default Amount is herein referred to as the "Lender Payment Portion"), the
Administrative Agent may, and shall upon the direction of the Required Lenders,
treat as advanced by the Defaulting Lender to itself (with a corresponding
automatic increase in the Defaulting Lender's Loan balance, and without
necessity for executing any further documents) the Lender Payment Portion,
whereupon a corresponding offset shall be made against the Default Amount;

            (c) If and to the extent any Default Amount remains (after taking
into account the deemed advance and application made under Section 10.11(b)
above), any or all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders shall be entitled (but shall
not be obligated) to fund all or part of the remaining Default Amount (the
"Funded Default Amount"), and collect from the Defaulting Lender or from amounts
otherwise payable to the Defaulting Lender interest at the Default Rate on the
Funded Default Amount for the period from the date on which the payment was due
until the date on which payment is made (less any interest actually paid by the
Borrower on the Funded Default Amount from time to time, which payments shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent pari passu to the Non-Defaulting Lenders
which shall have so funded the Funded Default Amount);

            (d) So long as any Default Amount remains outstanding, the
Defaulting Lender's interest in the Obligations and the Loan Documents and
proceeds thereof shall be subordinated to the interest of the Non-Defaulting
Lenders in the Obligations and the Loan Documents in the manner set forth in
Section 10.11(e) below, without necessity for executing any further documents,
provided that such Defaulting Lender's interest in the Obligations and the Loan
Documents and the proceeds thereof shall no longer be so subordinated if the
Default Amount (and all interest which has accrued pursuant to Section 10.11(c)
above) shall be repaid (or, if not funded by the Non-Defaulting Lenders,
advanced to the Administrative Agent for disbursement in accordance with this
Agreement) in full;

            (e) To achieve such subordination, that portion of all amounts
received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations which would
otherwise be payable to the


                                      104
<PAGE>

Defaulting Lender on account of its interest in the Obligations shall be applied
by the Administrative Agent as follows:

                  (i) first to pay pari passu to the Non-Defaulting Lenders the
Funded Default Amount, together with interest thereon payable under Section
10.11(c) above, until the Funded Default Amount and all interest thereon has
been repaid in full (with collections from the Borrower being deemed earned by
the Defaulting Lender to the extent of its Pro Rata Share thereof and paid over
to the Non-Defaulting Lenders for application first to interest (in accordance
with Section 10-13(c) above and then to principal upon the Funded Default
Amount); then

                  (ii) second, the remainder, if any, shall be deemed earned by
the Defaulting Lender to the extent of its Pro Rata Share thereof and held in
escrow by the Administrative Agent for distribution as follows:

                        (A) upon payment in full of all the Secured Obligations,
without foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (or other similar disposition
of the Collateral) or other enforcement proceedings with respect to the Secured
Obligations, the funds held in escrow shall be promptly disbursed to the
Defaulting Lender; and

                        (B) upon completion of any foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure (or other similar disposition of the Collateral) or other
enforcement proceedings with respect to the Secured Obligations the funds held
in trust shall be promptly disbursed as follows:

                        (1)   first, to the Non-Defaulting Lenders and their
                              Affiliates which are Holders of Secured
                              Obligations pari passu in the amount of all
                              Secured Obligations which have not been paid and
                              satisfied by the foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of
                              foreclosure (or other similar disposition of the
                              Collateral) or other enforcement proceedings with
                              respect to the Secured Obligations in order to
                              compensate the Non-Defaulting Lenders for any
                              failure to recover the full amount of the Secured
                              Obligations upon completion of any such
                              disposition of the Collateral or other enforcement
                              action; and

                        (2)   second, any remaining funds shall be disbursed to
                              the Defaulting Lender.

            (f) Each Non-Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but not the
obligation, in its sole discretion, to acquire such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata
Share of the Advances and the Obligations, together with the Funded Default
Amount, in which case the following provisions shall apply:

                  (i) If more than one Non-Defaulting Lender exercises such
right, each such Non-Defaulting Lender shall have the right to acquire (in
accordance with such acquiring Lender's Pro Rata Share (or upon agreement
thereof, any other proportion) of the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share in the
Advances and the Obligations, together with all of the Funded


                                      105
<PAGE>

Default Amount (being deemed a portion of the Obligations advanced by the
Non-Defaulting Lenders which funded the Funded Default Amount). Such right to
purchase shall be exercised by written notice from the applicable Non-Defaulting
Lender(s) electing to exercise such right to the Defaulting Lender and the
Administrative Agent (an "Exercise Notice"), copies of which shall also be sent
concurrently to the other Lenders. The Exercise Notice shall specify (A) the
Purchase Price for the Pro Rata Share of the Defaulting Lender, determined in
accordance with Section 10.11(f)(ii) below, and (B) the date on which such
purchase is to occur, which shall be any Business Day which is not less than
fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Exercise Notice is given, provided
that if such Defaulting Lender shall have cured its default in full (including
all interest and other amounts due in connection therewith) to the satisfaction
of the Administrative Agent within said fifteen (15) day period, then the
Exercise Notice shall be of no further effect and the applicable Non-Defaulting
Lenders shall no longer have a right to purchase such Defaulting Lender's Pro
Rate Share or the Funded Default Amount. Upon any such purchase of the Pro Rata
Share of a Defaulting Lender and as of the date of such purchase (the "Purchase
Date"), (X) the Non-Defaulting Lenders purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro
Rata Share shall also purchase the Funded Default Amount in equivalent
proportions from the Non-Defaulting Lenders which funded the same, for a
purchase price equal to par plus interest accrued and unpaid thereon under the
provisions of Section 10.11(c) ("Default Amount Accrued Interest"), (Y) the
Non-Defaulting Lenders purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share shall
promptly advance to the Administrative Agent their proportionate shares of any
unfunded portion of the Default Amount, and (Z) the Defaulting Lender's interest
in the Loans and the Obligations, and its rights hereunder as a Lender arising
from and after the Purchase Date (but not its rights and liabilities in respect
thereof or under the Loan Documents or this Agreement for obligations,
indemnities and other matters arising or matters occurring before the Purchase
Date) shall terminate on the Purchase Date, and the Defaulting Lender shall
promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer
such interest. Without in any manner limiting the remedies of the Lenders, the
obligations of a Defaulting Lender to sell and assign its Pro Rata Share under
this Section 10.11(f) shall be specifically enforceable by the Administrative
Agent and/or the other Lenders, by an action brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction for such purpose, it being acknowledged and agreed that, in light
of the disruption in the administration of the Advances and the other terms of
the Loan Documents that a Defaulting Lender may cause, damages and other
remedies at law are not adequate.

                  (ii) The purchase price for the Pro Rata Share in the Advances
and the Obligations of a Defaulting Lender (the "Purchase Price") shall be equal
to one hundred percent (100%) of the sum of all of the Defaulting Lender's
advances (including advances for Protective Advances) under the Loans
outstanding as of the Purchase Date, less the Default Amount Accrued Interest
and costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
directly as a result of the Defaulting Lender's default hereunder, court costs
and the fees and expenses of attorneys, paralegals, accountants and other
similar advisors, and if such amounts are not then known, there shall be
deducted from the Purchase Price and placed into escrow with the Administrative
Agent an amount equal to 200% of the Administrative Agent's reasonable estimate
of such costs, to be held for disbursement to pay such costs as incurred, with
any remainder being returned to the Defaulting Lender upon payment in full of
all the Secured Obligations. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Lenders
purchasing the Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share are entitled to do so at the
price set forth in this Section 10.11(f)(ii) due


                                      106
<PAGE>

to the risk that the Obligations and Collateral may further decline in value
after such purchase as a result of the Defaulting Lender's default.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to waive, diminish or
limit, or prevent or stop any Lender from exercising or enforcing, any rights or
remedies which may be available at law or in equity as a result of or in
connection with any default under this Agreement by a Lender. In addition, no
Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender if such Lender refuses to fund
its Pro Rata Share of any Advance being made after any bankruptcy-related
Default under Section 7.6 or Section 7.7 of this Agreement due to the lack of
bankruptcy court approval for such Advance.

      10.12 Authority. The Administrative Agent, as described herein, shall have
all rights with respect to collection and administration of the Obligations, the
security therefor and the exercise of remedies with respect thereto, except to
the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein. The Lenders agree that the
Administrative Agent shall make all determinations as to whether to grant or
withhold approvals under the Loan Documents and as to compliance with the terms
and conditions of the Loan Documents, except to the extent otherwise expressly
set forth therein or herein. The Administrative Agent will simultaneously
deliver to the Lenders copies of any default notices sent to Borrower,
Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the terms of the Loan Documents
and will promptly provide to the Lenders copies of any material notices received
from Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, including without
limitation notices received under Section 6.17(d) and notices received under
Section 6.18 (and copies of the documents received by the Administrative Agent
thereunder). The Administrative Agent shall not, however, take the following

                  (ii) release any collateral for the Secured Obligations, or
release any guaranty, indemnity agreement or any Person (including, without
limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantor) with respect to any such guaranty or
indemnity agreement (except for the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from the
Guaranty upon consummation of an Asset Sale with respect to such Subsidiary
Guarantor or substantially all of its assets and except for releases otherwise
expressly permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents upon satisfaction of all
applicable conditions specified therein), or waive or release any indemnity
obligations of Borrower, Co-Borrower or any guarantor (including, without
limitation, any Subsidiary Guarantor) to the Lenders under the Loan Documents;

                  (iii) increase the amount of any Commitment;

<PAGE>

                  (v) consent to the further encumbrance or hypothecation of all
or any portion of the Project or any other Collateral except to the extent
expressly permitted under the Loan Documents;

                  (vi) modify, waive or consent to any assignment in violation
of Section 12.1(i);

                  (vii) change the Pro Rata Share of any Lender, except in
connection with a transfer of a Lender's interest permitted under the Loan
Agreement;

                  (viii) modify or amend this Section 10.12; or

                  (ix) modify or amend the definition of "Unanimous Lenders" or
"Required Lenders" herein.

            (b) The Administrative Agent shall not, without first obtaining the
consent of the Required Lenders, take any of the following actions:

                  (i) exercise (or refrain from exercising) rights or remedies
with respect to any Default, including any action with respect to the exercise
of remedies or the realization, operation or disposition of any Collateral,
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may deliver consents
contemplated by the Loan Documents and waivers of provisions (other than
material provisions) of the Loan Documents;

                  (ii) consent to any material change in Project Scope of Work
which reflects a material reduction in the revenue generating capacity of the
Project or a material reduction in the Project quality, in each case to the
extent that any such changes require the Administrative Agent's consent pursuant
to the terms of the Loan Documents;

                  (iii) amend, supplement or otherwise modify in any material
respect any of the Loan Documents or execute a written waiver of any material
provision of the Loan Documents, provided that such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver does not require the consent of all the Lenders under
Section 10.14(a) above;

                  (iv) consent to the transfer by Borrower or Co-Borrower of all
or any part of its direct or indirect interest in the Project or any other
Collateral, except to the extent expressly permitted under the Loan Documents;

                  (v) consent to any Change of Control; or

                  (vi) agree to cause an additional or updated Appraisal to be
ordered at the Lenders' expense.

      As to any matters which are subject to the consent of any or all of the
Lenders, as set forth above or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent shall not be permitted or required to exercise any discretion or to take
any action except upon the receipt of the written consent or instruction with
respect to such action by the requisite Lenders, which written consent or
instruction shall be binding upon the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to


                                      108
<PAGE>

the contrary, it is understood and agreed that the Lenders' right to consent to
or disapprove any particular matter shall be limited to the extent that the
Lenders' or Administrative Agent's rights to consent to or disapprove of such
matter are limited in the Loan Documents.

      As to any matter which is subject to a vote of the Lenders hereunder, any
of the Lenders may require the Administrative Agent to initiate such a vote. In
such event, the Administrative Agent shall conduct a vote in accordance with the
provisions of the next paragraph. The Administrative Agent shall be bound by the
results of such vote, so long as the action voted in favor of is permissible
under the Loan Documents and under applicable law, and subject to the obligation
of each Lender to contribute its Pro Rata Share of all expenses and liabilities
incurred in connection therewith as more fully set forth below.

      All communications from the Administrative Agent to the Lenders requesting
the Lenders' approval (i) shall be given in the form of a written notice to each
Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter as to which
such approval is requested and (iii) shall include, if appropriate, the
recommendation of the Administrative Agent, if any.

      Subject to the foregoing limitations, each Lender hereby appoints and
constitutes the Administrative Agent as its agent with full power and authority
to exercise on behalf of such Lender any and all rights and remedies which such
Lender may have with respect to, and to the extent necessary under applicable
law for, the enforcement of the Loan Documents, including the right to exercise,
or to refrain from exercising, any and all remedies afforded to such Lender by
the Loan Documents or which such Lender may have as a matter of law.

      Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, each Lender shall be
responsible for its Pro Rata Share of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses or liabilities incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with
the Obligations, the protection of any security for the Secured Obligations, the
enforcement of the Loan Documents or the management or operation of the Project
or any other Collateral after acquisition of title thereto. Each Lender shall,
within twenty (20) days after a written demand therefor accompanied with a
description of the amounts payable, contribute its respective Pro Rata Share of
the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, fees
of receivers or trustees, court costs, title company charges, filing and
recording fees, appraisers' fees and expenses of attorneys.

      10.13 Borrower Default. Promptly after the Administrative Agent acquires
actual knowledge that a Default has occurred, the Administrative Agent shall
evaluate the circumstances of such Default, its impact on Borrower, Co-Borrower
and Subsidiary Guarantors and the courses of action available to the Lenders,
which may include such responses as entering into a forbearance agreement for a
period of time, establishing certain additional credit or collateral safeguards
in exchange for a waiver of such Default or determining the timing and order of
enforcement of the remedies available to the Lenders. Unless expressly directed
in writing to the contrary by the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent is
expressly authorized to discuss such Default and possible resolutions with the
Borrower, Co-Borrower and Subsidiary Guarantors and to refrain from exercising
any rights and remedies while conducting such evaluation, provided that the
Administrative Agent shall not enter into any written forbearance agreement with
Borrower or Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor without the


                                      109
<PAGE>

prior consent of the Required Lenders. The foregoing provisions shall not limit
the right, power or authority of the Administrative Agent to take actions
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1 or Section 9.19.

      The Administrative Agent shall, upon completing such evaluation and if the
Administrative Agent deems it appropriate, forward to each Lender a written
proposal outlining the course of action that the Administrative Agent
recommends, if any.

      If the Required Lenders so approve the Administrative Agent's proposal,
the Administrative Agent shall seek to implement such proposal in due course in
the same manner the Administrative Agent generally implements similar proposals
for loans held for its own account.

      The Lenders agree to cooperate in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner in connection with the exercise by the Administrative Agent of
the rights granted to the Lenders by law and the Loan Documents, including, but
not limited to, providing necessary information to the Administrative Agent with
respect to the Obligations, preparing and executing necessary affidavits,
certificates, notices, instruments and documents and participating in the
organization of applicable entities to hold title to the Project. Each Lender
agrees that it shall subscribe to and accept its Pro Rata Share of the ownership
interests in any entity organized to hold title to the Project and any other
Collateral. Each Lender agrees that it shall subscribe to and accept its Pro
Rata Share of the ownership interests in any entity organized to hold title to
the Project and each such Lender agrees that the nature of such entity shall be
determined by the Required Lenders. The Administrative Agent is hereby
authorized to act for and on behalf of the Lenders in all day-to-day matters
with respect to the exercise of rights described herein such as the supervision
of attorneys, accountants, appraisers or others acting for the benefit of all of
the Lenders in connection with litigation, foreclosure, realization of all or
any security given as collateral for the Secured Obligations or other similar
actions.

      10.14 Acquisition of Project. If the Administrative Agent (or its nominee
or designee), on behalf of the Lenders, acquires the Project or any other
Collateral either by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, then the
Lenders agree to negotiate in good faith to reach agreement among themselves in
writing relating to the ownership, operation, maintenance, marketing, and sale
of such Project. The Lenders agree that such agreement shall be consistent with
the following:

            (a) The Collateral will not be held as a long term investment but
will be marketed in an attempt to sell the Collateral in a time period
consistent with the regulations applicable to national banks for owning real
estate. Current Appraisals of the Collateral shall be obtained by the
Administrative Agent, such Appraisals shall be furnished to the Lenders from
time to time during the ownership period at the Lenders' expense (without
diminishing or releasing any obligation of Borrower and Co-Borrower to pay for
such costs) and an appraised value shall be established and updated from time to
time based on such Appraisals.

            (b) Decision-making with respect to the day to day operations of the
Project will be delegated to management and leasing agents. All agreements with
such management and leasing agents will be subject to the approval of the
Required Lenders. All material decisions


                                      110
<PAGE>

reserved to the owner in such agreements will also be subject to the approval of
the Required Lenders. The day to day supervision of such agents shall be done by
the Administrative Agent.

            (c) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, all
decisions as to whether to sell the Project and any other Collateral shall be
subject to the approval of all the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Lenders agree that if the Administrative Agent receives a bona fide "all cash"
(as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion) offer for the
purchase of the Project or other Collateral which has been approved in writing
by the Required Lenders and such offer equals or exceeds one hundred percent
(100%) of the most recent appraised value of the Project or such other
Collateral as established by an Appraisal that has been completed within six
months of such offer, then the Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized to
accept such offer on behalf of all the Lenders.

            (d) All expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders in connection with the Project shall be allocated among the Lenders pro
rata in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. In the event any
Lender does not pay its Pro Rata Share of such expenses, such Lender shall be
subject to the terms of Section 10.13 above.

            (e) All proceeds received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
from the operation, sale or other disposition of Project and any other
Collateral (net of expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection
therewith and any reserves deemed reasonably necessary by the Required Lenders
for potential obligations of the Lenders with respect to the Project and subject
to Section 10.13 above) shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with each
Lender's Pro Rata Share from time to time upon authorization by the Required
Lenders.

            (f) All expenditures and other actions taken with respect to the
Project and any other Collateral shall at all times be subject to the
regulations and requirements pertaining to national banks applicable thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all necessary approvals from
regulatory authorities in connection with any expenditure of funds by the
Lenders shall be a condition to such expenditure.

      10.15 Documents. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, it is
acknowledged and agreed that (a) the Administrative Agent has not and shall not
provide to the other Lenders documents, other than Loan Documents delivered as
of the Effective Date, received from Borrower with respect to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 4.1 or the conditions precedent to the
initial or any subsequent Advances, but that such documents are or shall be
available for inspection by each Lender, and (b) the determination by each
Lender of whether the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1 and 4.2 have
been satisfied shall be for the benefit of each such Lender only, and may not be
relied on by any other party.

      10.16 Receipt and Maintenance of Loan Documents. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has received, reviewed and approved the form of the Loan Documents
delivered as of the Effective Date. Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent and to each of the Lenders party hereto on the Effective Date executed
original counterparts of all of the Loan Documents, other than the originals of
the Notes, each of which shall be delivered to the Lender named therein.


                                      111
<PAGE>

      10.17 No Representations. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the
Administrative Agent has not made any representations or warranties, express or
implied, with respect to any aspect of the Loan, including, without limitation
(i) the existing or future solvency or financial condition or responsibility of
Borrower, Co-Borrower and Subsidiary Guarantors, (ii) the payment or
collectibility of the Obligations, (iii) the validity, enforceability or legal
effect of the Loan Documents, or the Mortgage Title Insurance Policy or the
survey furnished by Borrower, or (iv) the validity or effectiveness of the lien
created by the Mortgage or any other liens or security interests required by the
Loan Agreement.

      10.18 No Relation. The relationship between the Administrative Agent, the
Co-Lead Arrangers, Joint Book-Running Managers, Syndication Agent, Documentation
Agent and the other Lenders is not intended by the parties to create, and shall
not create, any trust, joint venture or partnership relation between them.

      10.19 Standard of Care. The Administrative Agent shall be liable to the
Lenders for any loss or liability sustained in connection with its management
and administration of the Obligations, or in connection with the exercise of any
rights and remedies under the Loan Documents or at law, only if, and to the
extent, such loss or liability results from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Administrative Agent or any of its employees, officers,
agents or directors or a breach of the Administrative Agent's express
obligations under this Agreement.

      10.20 No Responsibility for Loans, Etc. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement (including Section 10.21), none of the Administrative Agent, the
Initial Lender Affiliates or any of their respective shareholders, directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation
made in connection with any Loan Document or any Advances hereunder; (ii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor
under any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by an
obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (iii) the satisfaction
of any condition specified herein; (iv) the validity, effectiveness or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection therewith; or (v) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or
priority of any interest in any collateral security. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of the Initial Lender Affiliates shall have any duty to disclose
to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished to it by the
Borrower or Co-Borrower.

      10.21 Payments After Default. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.13
regarding the subordination of any Defaulting Lender's interest, after the
occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply all payments in
respect of any Obligations and all proceeds of Collateral in the following
order:

                  (i) first, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees, expense
reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Administrative Agent;

                  (ii) second, to pay principal of and interest on any
Protective Advance for which the Administrative Agent has not then been paid by
the Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders;


                                      112
<PAGE>

                  (iii) third, to pay Obligations in respect of any fees,
expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders (other than Rate
Management Obligations);

                  (iv) fourth, to the ratable payment, on a pari passu basis, of
(a) principal and interest on the Loans (such application to be made first to
interest and then to principal) and (b) Secured Rate Management Obligations; and

                  (v) fifth, to the ratable payment of all other Obligations.

      The order of priority set forth in this Section 10.23 is set forth solely
to determine the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders as among themselves. As between Borrower, Co-Borrower and Subsidiary
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and Lenders on the
other, after the occurrence of a Default the Administrative Agent and Lenders
may apply all payments in respect of any Secured Obligations, and all proceeds
of Collateral, to the Secured Obligations in such order and manner as the
Administrative Agent and Lenders may elect in their sole and absolute
discretion. The order of priority set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this
Section 10.21 may be changed by the Required Lenders with the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent.

      10.22 Payments Received. All payments received by the Administrative Agent
from the Borrower for the account of the Lenders shall be disbursed to the
applicable Lenders no later than the next Business Day following the day such
payment is received in good funds by the Administrative Agent. If payments
received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower are not disbursed to the
applicable Lenders the same day as they are received, such funds shall be
invested overnight by the Administrative Agent and each Lender will receive its
Pro Rata Share of any interest so earned. The Lenders acknowledge that the
Administrative Agent does not guarantee any particular level of return on the
overnight funds and that the Administrative Agent will invest such funds as it
deems prudent from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

      11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
Lenders under applicable law, if Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary
Guarantor becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and
all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and
whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time
held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit
or account of Borrower, Co-Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor may be offset
and applied toward the payment of the Secured Obligations owing to such Lender,
whether or not the Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

      11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than payments
received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than
that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding


                                      113
<PAGE>

Credit Exposure held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each
Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit
Exposure. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which
might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection
for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender
agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary to provide that the
Administrative Agent and all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12(b).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

      12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower,
Co-Borrower, Subsidiary Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and
their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) Borrower, Co-Borrower
and Subsidiary Guarantors shall not have the right to assign their respective
rights or obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any
Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. The parties to this
Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only to
absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments creating security
interests, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment by any Lender
of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a
Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment
creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its
obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with
the provisions of Section 12.3. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person
which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but
shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to
another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by
acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the
Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of any
Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to
such Loan.

      12.2 Participations.

      12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell
to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests
in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Note held by such Lender,
any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the
Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating
interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents
shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain
the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued
to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts
payable by Borrower and Co-Borrower under this Agreement


                                      114
<PAGE>

shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests,
and Borrower and Co-Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents.

      12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve,
without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or
waiver with respect to any Advance or Commitment in which such Participant has
an interest which (a) forgives principal, interest, fees or reduces the interest
rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment (except in
connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-Default increase in
interest rates), extends the Maturity Date, postpones any date fixed for any
required payment of principal of, or interest on any Loan in which such
Participant has an interest, or any regularly-scheduled payment of fees on any
such Advance or Commitment, (b) releases any guarantor of any such Advance
(except in connection with an Asset Sale in accordance with the terms hereof) or
all or substantially all of any collateral, if any, securing any such Advance;
(c) increases the amount of the participant's participation over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
participation, and that an increase in any Commitment (or the available portion
thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if
the participant's participation therein is not increased as a result thereof) or
(d) consents to the assignment or transfer by Borrower or Co-Borrower of any of
their obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Borrower, Co-Borrower and the other Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon any
actions taken by a Lender in its capacity as such, whether or not within the
scope of such Lender's authority under any agreement between the Lender and a
Participant.

      12.2.3 Benefit of Setoff. Borrower and Co-Borrower agree that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1
in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each
Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders
agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any
amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to
be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

      12.3 Assignments.

      12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Subject to satisfaction of the applicable
requirements and conditions set forth in this Section 12.3, any Lender may, in
the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
any time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any
part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, subject to the
following:

                  (i) such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit F or in such other form as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent;


                                      115
<PAGE>

                  (ii) the consent of Borrower and the Administrative Agent, not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall be required prior to an assignment
becoming effective, and, unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent otherwise consents, each assignment with respect to an Eligible Assignee
which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall be in an amount not less
than the lesser of (A) $5,000,000 or (B) the remaining amount of the assigning
Lender's Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment) or
outstanding Loans (if the applicable Commitment has been terminated); provided,
however, that (1) the consent of Borrower shall not be required for an
assignment from one Lender to another Lender or an Affiliate thereof; (2) the
consent of Borrower shall not be required in connection with any such
assignments occurring in connection with the primary syndication of this
facility and (3) if a Default has occurred and is continuing, no consent of the
Borrower to any assignment shall be required;

                  (iii) Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, a
Lender shall not be permitted to assign less than the entire remaining amount of
the assigning Lender's Commitment or outstanding Loans if upon completion of
such assignment the remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
(calculated as at the date of such assignment) or outstanding Loans (if the
applicable Commitment has been terminated) shall be less than $5,000,000; and

                  (iv) No Lender shall assign all or any part of its rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents (A) prior to December 31, 2001, without the
Administrative Agent's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (B)
to any Person other than an Eligible Assignee.

      12.3.2 Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the Administrative
Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1,
and (b) payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 to the
Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived
by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the
effective date specified in such assignment. On and after the effective date of
such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan

the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).
