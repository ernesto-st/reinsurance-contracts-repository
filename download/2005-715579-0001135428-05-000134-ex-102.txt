                                    because of the accounting firm's
                                    determination of any adjustments, such
                                    payment due under this provision shall be

                           hereby agrees to surrender to Acquisition Subsidiary
                           and exchange all shares representing 100% of the
                           ownership interest in RIG.

                  (3)      Each certificate representing shares of RIG Common
                           Stock surrendered shall thereafter represent the
                           right to receive the Purchase Price Consideration
                           pursuant to this Section 3.

                  (5)      At the Closing, Acquisition Subsidiary shall

                           Stock, upon surrender of his shares in one or more
                           certificates, a wire transfer authorization for an
                           amount equal to the cash, which such holder has the

                           event shall the holder of any such surrendered

                           of the Fixed Cash Consideration. If a wire transfer
                           authorization is made in the name of a person other
                           than the person in whose name the certificates
                           surrendered for exchange therefore are registered, it
                           shall be a condition of the exchange that the person
                           requesting such exchange shall pay to Acquisition
                           Subsidiary any transfer taxes required by reason of
                           issuance of such wire transfer to a person other than
                           the registered holder of the certificates
                           surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable
                           satisfaction of Acquisition Subsidiary that such tax
                           has been paid or is not applicable.

         3.4      CLOSING OF STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS; CANCELLATION OF RIG

                  Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are
                  presented for transfer to Acquisition Subsidiary, they shall
                  be deemed owned by Acquisition Subsidiary and exchanged for
                  the Purchase Price Consideration as provided in this Section
                  3. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding,
                  neither ACNB Corp nor its agent nor any Party to this

                           to acquire or to merge with or into another entity so

                  and its subsidiaries are in good standing as a foreign

                  leased or operated, or the business conducted, by ACNB Corp
                  requires such qualification, except for such failure to
                  qualify or be in such good standing which, when taken together
                  with all other such failures, would not have a Material
                  Adverse Effect on ACNB Corp and its subsidiaries, taken as a

         4.4      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS. Except as
                  disclosed on Schedule 4.4 or where noncompliance would not
                  have a Material Adverse Effect upon the condition (financial
                  or otherwise), assets, liabilities, business, operations or
                  future prospects of ACNB Corp: (i) ACNB Corp is in compliance

                  force and effect and there are no proceedings pending, or to
                  the knowledge of ACNB Corp threatened, which may result in the

                  indenture, deed of trust, capital lease, security agreement,
                  loan agreement, or commitment for the borrowing of money, or
                  the deferred purchase price of assets, or other agreement,
                  instrument, or obligation to which ACNB Corp is a party, or to
                  which any of ACNB Corp's properties or assets may be bound, or
                  affected, except for any of the foregoing that, individually
                  or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
                  on ACNB Corp or enable any person to enjoin the transactions;
                  and, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
                  will not require any approval, consent or waiver under any
                  such law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order,
                  governmental permit or license or the approval, consent, or
                  waiver of any other party to any such agreement, indenture, or
                  instrument, other than (x) all required approvals, consents,
                  and waivers of governmental authorities, (y) any such
                  approval, consent, or waiver that already has been obtained,
                  and (z) any other approvals, consents, or waivers, the absence
                  of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not result
                  in a Material Adverse Effect on ACNB Corp or enable any person
                  to enjoin the transactions.

         4.12     NO UNDISCLOSED INFORMATION. No provision of this Section 4 or

                    SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                         OF RIG AND THE RIG SHAREHOLDER

         RIG and the RIG Shareholder, on behalf of RIG and its subsidiaries and
affiliates, each represent and warrant jointly and severally to ACNB Corp and
Acquisition Subsidiary as follows:

         5.1      CORPORATE ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. The RIG Shareholder
                  is an adult individual and shareholder of RIG holding, in the
                  aggregate, 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of RIG
                  and owned as delineated in the name, number and percentages
                  set forth on Schedule 5.1. The RIG Shareholder has good and
                  marketable title to all of the issued and outstanding capital
                  stock of RIG free and clear of all encumbrances, contracts,
                  rights, options and assignments whatsoever. RIG is a
                  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
                  standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and is in
                  good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
                  where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the
                  business conducted, by RIG requires such qualification, except
                  for the failure to qualify or be in good standing which, when
                  taken together with all other such failures, would not have a
                  Material Adverse Effect on RIG taken as a whole. RIG owns,
                  directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
                  shares, units, or interests of the subsidiaries listed on
                  Schedule 5.1 and each such subsidiary is in good standing.

         5.2      AUTHORIZED CAPITAL. The authorized capital stock of RIG
                  consists of 500 shares of RIG Common Stock, $0.00 par value
                  per share, of which 100 shares of RIG Common Stock are issued
                  and outstanding, and 0 shares of RIG Common Stock are held in
                  the treasury of RIG as of September 1, 2004. Except as
                  disclosed on Schedule 5.2, all of the outstanding shares of
                  capital stock of RIG have been duly authorized and are validly
                  issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No shares of RIG are
                  held in connection with a debt previously contracted. Except
                  to the extent that all of the RIG authorized shares have not
                  been issued, RIG does not have shares of capital stock
                  reserved for issuance. RIG does not have outstanding bonds,
                  debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which
                  have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
                  securities having the right to vote) with shareholders on any
                  matter. The outstanding shares of capital stock of RIG have
                  not been issued in violation of any preemptive rights. There
                  are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights,
                  convertible securities or other agreements or commitments of
                  any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
                  or other securities of RIG and there are no outstanding
                  agreements, restrictions, contracts, commitments or demands of
                  any character to which any RIG Shareholder or RIG is a party,
                  which relate to the transfer or restrict the transfer of any
                  shares of RIG Common Stock. Except as disclosed on Schedule
                  5.2, there are no shareholder agreements, understandings or
                  commitments relating to the right to vote or dispose of RIG
                  Common Stock. All shareholder agreements, understandings, or
                  commitments listed on Schedule 5.2 shall be terminated at or

                                       19
<PAGE>

                  prior to Closing. After the Effective Time, RIG will have no
                  obligation which is being assumed by ACNB Corp that will
                  result in any obligation to issue, transfer or sell any shares
                  of capital stock pursuant to any RIG Employee Plan (as defined
                  in Subsection 5.13).

         5.3      TITLE. Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.3, the RIG
                  Shareholder has good and marketable title to all of the issued
                  and outstanding capital stock of RIG free and clear of all
                  encumbrances, contracts, rights, options and assignments
                  whatsoever. Following the sale and transfer of the RIG Common
                  Stock by the RIG Shareholder to ACNB Corp in accordance with
                  the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
                  ACNB Corp shall have good and marketable title to the RIG
                  Shares free and clear of any and all valid claims, charges,
                  defenses, offsets, encumbrances of any kind or nature,
                  contracts, rights, options and assignments, except as created
                  by action of ACNB Corp.

         5.4      CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Subject only to approval of this
                  Agreement by the holders of the number of votes required by
                  RIG's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws cast by all holders
                  of RIG Common Stock (without any minority, class or series
                  voting requirement), RIG has the requisite corporate power and
                  authority, and legal right, and has taken all corporate action
                  necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement and
                  to consummate the transactions applicable to RIG contemplated
                  hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
                  delivered by RIG and the RIG Shareholder and constitutes the
                  valid and binding obligations of RIG and the RIG Shareholder
                  enforceable against them, in accordance with its terms, except
                  to the extent enforcement is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
                  and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights or the
                  application by a court of equitable principles and subject to
                  compliance with all regulatory requirements and the execution
                  hereof by ACNB Corp and Acquisition Subsidiary. As of the date
                  of this Agreement, RIG and the RIG Shareholder know of no
                  reason why the regulatory approvals referred to in Subsection
                  8.1(2) should not be timely obtained.

         5.5      CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery
                  and performance of this Agreement by RIG and the RIG
                  Shareholder does not, and the consummation of the transactions
                  contemplated hereby by it will not, constitute (i) subject to
                  receipt of any required regulatory approvals, a breach or
                  violation of, or a default under, any law, rule or regulation
                  or any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or
                  license, to which RIG (or any of its properties) is subject,
                  which breach, violation or default would have a Material
                  Adverse Effect on it, or enable any person to enjoin the
                  transactions, (ii) a breach or violation of, or a default
                  under RIG's Articles of Incorporation, or Bylaws, or (iii) a
                  breach or violation of, or a default under (or an event which
                  with due notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
                  default under), or result in the termination of, accelerate
                  the performance required by, or result in the creation of any
                  lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other encumbrance
                  upon any of the properties or assets of RIG or of the RIG
                  Shareholder as an individual under any of the terms,


                                       20

                  conditions or provisions of any note, bond, indenture, deed of
                  trust, capital lease, security agreement, loan agreement, or
                  commitment for the borrowing of money, or the deferred
                  purchase price of assets, or other agreement, instrument or
                  obligation to which the RIG Shareholder as individuals or RIG
                  is a party, or to which any of RIG's properties or assets may
                  be bound, or affected, except for any of the foregoing that,
                  individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
                  Adverse Effect on RIG or enable any person to enjoin the
                  transactions; and, the consummation of the transactions
                  contemplated hereby will not require any approval, consent or
                  waiver under any such law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree,
                  order, governmental permit or license or the approval, consent
                  or waiver of any other party to any such agreement, indenture
                  or instrument, other than (x) all required approvals, consents
                  and waivers of governmental authorities, (y) any such
                  approval, consent or waiver that already has been obtained,
                  and (z) any other approvals, consents or waivers, the absence
                  of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not result
                  in a Material Adverse Effect on RIG or enable any person to
                  enjoin the transactions.

         5.6      REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                  (1)      Attached as Schedule 5.6(1) are copies of the

                  (3)      Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.6(3) or in the RIG
                           2003 Financial Statements, RIG had no Material
                           liability (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
                           otherwise) which is required to be reflected, noted
                           or reserved against therein which is in any case or
                           in the aggregate Material. Since December 31, 2003
                           RIG has not incurred any such liability other than
                           liabilities of the same nature as those set forth in
                           the RIG 2003 Financial Statements, all of which have
                           been reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of
                           business.

                           required by Subsection 5.6, as of the date of such
                           document or other materials, contained, or as to
                           documents or other materials to be delivered after
                           the date hereof will not contain, any untrue
                           statement of Material fact, or, at the date thereof,
                           omit to state a Material fact necessary in order to
                           make the statements contained therein, in light of
                           the circumstances under which such statements will be
                           made, misleading; provided, however, that information
                           as of a later date shall be deemed to modify
                           information as of any earlier date.

         5.7      ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.

                  (1)      As of June 30, 2004, RIG's liabilities do not exceed

                           consistent with past practices; (ii) suffered a
                           change, or any event involving a prospective change,
                           in the business, assets, financial condition, or
                           results of operations of RIG which has had, or is
                           reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
                           aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (other than as
                           a result of changes or proposed changes in federal or
                           state regulations of general applicability or
                           interpretations thereof, changes in generally
                           accepted accounting principles, and changes that
                           could, under the circumstances, reasonably have been
                           anticipated in light of disclosures made in writing
                           by RIG to ACNB Corp pursuant hereto); or (iii)
                           subsequent to the date hereof, except as permitted by

                           operations other than in the ordinary course of
                           business and consistent with past practices.

                   (2)     RIG has no liability (and RIG is not aware of any
                           basis for any present or future action, suit,
                           proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge,

         5.8      TAXES.

                  (1)      RIG has timely filed all federal, state, county and
                           local Tax Returns in respect of Taxes. Each such Tax
                           Return is complete and accurate in all Material
                           respects. RIG has paid all taxes owed or owing. No
                           waivers of statutes of limitations, and no agreement
                           relating to assessment or collection, are in effect
                           in respect of any Taxes. There are no claims pending
                           against RIG for the alleged deficiency in the payment
                           of any Taxes, and RIG does not know of any pending or
                           threatened audits, investigations or claims for
                           unpaid Taxes or relating to any liability in respect
                           of Taxes.

                  (2)      As of the date of this Agreement, RIG has made
                           available to ACNB Corp true and correct copies of all
                           income, franchise, capital and other Tax Returns
                           filed by RIG for all taxable years or periods for
                           which the relevant statute of limitations has not
                           expired. RIG is not a party to any tax allocation or
                           sharing agreement, is not or has not been a member of
                           an affiliated group filing consolidated or combined
                           Tax Returns or otherwise has any tax liability for
                           the Taxes of any Person (other than RIG). No closing
                           agreements, private letter rulings, technical advice
                           memoranda or similar agreements or rulings have been
                           entered into or issued by any taxing authority with
                           respect to RIG.

                  (3)      The provision for current Taxes payable reflected in
                           "Other Liabilities" in the RIG Financial Statements,
                           as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time,
                           is and will be adequate to cover all Taxes that may
                           become due and payable (based upon the accrual method
                           of accounting) by RIG in future periods (i) in
                           respect of all transactions, sales or services
                           occurring or performed on or prior to the Effective
                           Date, which by virtue of tax or accounting treatment
                           will not be payable until subsequent to such date, or
                           (ii) in respect of deductions, costs or other
                           allowances taken for federal income tax purposes
                           which RIG accountants have reason to believe are
                           likely to be disallowed by the IRS if audited by such
                           Service.

                  (4)      No consent has been filed relating to RIG pursuant
                           to Section 341(f) of the Code of 1986.

         5.9      LITIGATION. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9, as of the
                  date of this Agreement, (i) there is no action, suit,
                  judicial, or administrative proceeding, arbitration or
                  investigation pending or to RIG's Knowledge threatened against
                  or involving RIG or any RIG Shareholder or any of their

                  judgment, decree, injunction, rule, or order of any court,

                  or arbitrator outstanding against RIG or any of the RIG
                  Shareholder; and (iii) RIG and its Shareholders are not in
                  violation of any term of any judgments, decrees, injunctions,

                                       23

                  or orders outstanding against them, except to the extent that
                  such events, violations or incidents set forth in (i) through
                  (iii) above in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse
                  Effect on RIG. RIG will furnish to ACNB Corp prior to the
                  Closing, in writing, a description of all litigation, actions,
                  suits, proceedings, arbitrations, investigations known to it,
                  judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders pending; or to its
                  Knowledge, threatened against or involving RIG or any of the
                  RIG Shareholder, or any of their properties or rights as of
                  the date hereof.

         5.10     ABSENCE OF REGULATORY ACTIONS.  RIG is not subject to any
                  federal or state governmental actions by any authority
                  charged with the supervision or regulation of insurance
                  agencies or insurance producers, agents or brokers.

         5.11     CONTRACTS.

                           mortgages, notes, security agreements, leases,
                           agreements, or understandings, whether written or

                           operations of RIG or to which RIG or any of the RIG
                           Shareholder or their respective assets or operations

                           to be in full force and effect would not,
                           individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
                           Adverse Effect. Schedule 5.11 sets forth a complete
                           description of all Material Contracts.

                           plan of an ERISA Affiliate that were required by
                           Section 302 of ERISA and were due prior to the date

                           the present value of the "benefit liabilities" (as
                           defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such

                  (7)      Neither it nor any ERISA Affiliate has committed any
                           act or omission or engaged in any transaction that
                           has caused it to incur, or created a Material risk

                           Sections 4971 through 4980B of the Code, other than

                  (8)      There is no pending or threatened litigation,
                           administrative action or proceeding relating to any

                           benefits.

                  (9)      There has been no announcement or legally binding
                           commitment by it to create an additional Employee

                           amendments required by applicable law which do not
                           Materially increase the cost of such Employee Plan,
                           and, except as disclosed on Schedule 5.13 hereto, it
                           does not have any obligations for retiree health and
                           life benefits under any Employee Plan that cannot be
                           terminated without incurring any liability
                           thereunder.

                  (10)     The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
                           consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
                           will not result in any payment or series of payments
                           by RIG to any person which is an "excess parachute
                           payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code)

         5.14     TITLE TO ASSETS.

                  (1)      RIG does not own any real property. RIG has good and
                           marketable title, free and clear of all liens and
                           encumbrances, to all other property and assets,
                           tangible and intangible, reflected in the RIG 2003
                           Financial Statements or purported to have been
                           acquired by it since the date thereof except liens
                           for taxes or assessments not delinquent, and such
                           other liens and encumbrances and imperfections of
                           title as do not Materially affect the value of such
                           property or as reflected in the RIG 2003 Financial
                           Statements and which do not interfere with or impair
                           its present and continued use. All real properties
                           leased or operated by the RIG Shareholder (the "RIG
                           Shareholder Real Property") that are Material to the
                           business, operations or financial condition of RIG
                           are in substantially good operating condition and
                           repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted). None of the
                           Material structures on the RIG Shareholder Real
                           Property encroaches upon real property of another
                           Person, and no structure of any Person encroaches
                           upon the RIG Shareholder Real Property. The RIG
                           Shareholder Real Property and its continued use,
                           occupancy and operation as currently used, occupied
                           and operated does not in any Material respect
                           constitute a nonconforming use under any applicable
                           law, statute, ordinance, code, order, regulation or
                           standard.

                  (2)      All properties held by RIG under leases are held by
                           it under valid, binding and enforceable leases
                           (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
                           reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and
                           similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally
                           and subject, as to enforceability, to general
                           principles of equity), with such exceptions as are
                           not Material and do not interfere with the conduct of
                           its business, as the case may be, and it enjoys quiet
                           and peaceful possession of such leased properties.
                           RIG, and to its Knowledge any third party, is not in
                           default in any Material respect under any Material

                           lease, agreement or obligation regarding RIG's
                           properties or to which RIG is a party or by which it
                           is bound.

         5.15     COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

                  (1)      RIG and each RIG Shareholder and employee holds all
                           licenses, permits, and governmental authorizations
                           necessary for the lawful conduct of its business, and
                           to the Knowledge of RIG and the RIG Shareholder, the
                           business of RIG is not being conducted in violation
                           of, any provision of any federal, state, local, or
                           foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation,
                           judgment, decree, order, concession, grant,
                           franchise, permit or license, or other governmental
                           authorization or approval applicable to RIG or any
                           RIG Shareholder, officer, director or employee except
                           for such licenses, permits or governmental
                           authorizations, the failure of which, and violations
                           which, would not have in the aggregate a Material
                           Adverse Effect on RIG.

                  (2)      (i) Where required or advisable, RIG and each RIG
                           Shareholder, officer, director and employee, is duly
                           registered as an insurance producer, agent or broker
                           (or in a similar capacity) with all appropriate
                           governmental authorities, and each such registration
                           is in full force and effect except where the failure
                           to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a
                           Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) except where the
                           failure to so register, when aggregated with all
                           other such failures, would not reasonably be expected
                           to have a Material Adverse Effect on RIG. Schedule
                           5.15(2) sets forth the list of each RIG Shareholder,
                           officer, director and employee that acts or has acted
                           as an insurance producer, agent or broker in the
                           United States or otherwise within the past five
                           years. RIG has made available to ACNB Corp its
                           current compliance manual and any other supervisory
                           and compliance policies and procedures, as
                           applicable.

                  (3)      RIG has been duly authorized by all applicable state
                           insurance regulatory authorities to issue the
                           insurance policies that it is currently writing in
                           the respective states in which it conducts its
                           business, except for authorizations the failure to
                           have which would not, individually or in the
                           aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. RIG has
                           all other Material licenses, permits, consents,
                           approvals and authorizations of any governmental
                           entity ("Permits") necessary to conduct its business
                           in the manner and in the jurisdictions in which it is
                           presently being conducted, and all such Permits are
                           valid and in full force and effect, except where the
                           failure to have such a Permit or the invalidity or
                           ineffectiveness thereof would not, individually or in
                           the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (4)      RIG has made (or in the case of filings after the
                           date hereof, will make) available to ACNB Corp true
                           and complete copies of (i) all filings made by RIG

                           two years, (ii) all inspection reports related to RIG
                           provided by any governmental authority during the
                           past four years and (iii) all Material correspondence
                           relating to any inquiry or investigation by a
                           governmental authority relating to RIG provided to
                           RIG since December 31, 2003.

         5.16     BROKERS. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.16, neither RIG nor
                  any of its officers, directors, employees or agents have
                  employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for
                  any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions, or
                  finder's fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or
                  indirectly for it in connection with this Agreement or the
                  transactions contemplated hereby.

         5.17     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (3)      There is no legal, administrative, arbitration or
                           other proceeding, claim, action, cause of action or

                           impose, or that, to the Knowledge of RIG and the RIG
                           Shareholder, could result in the imposition on RIG of
                           any liability arising under any local, state or
                           federal environmental statute, regulation or
                           ordinance including, without limitation, the
                           Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
                           and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or
                           threatened against RIG; to the Knowledge of RIG and
                           the RIG Shareholder, there is no reasonable basis for

                           investigation; and RIG is not subject to any
                           agreement, order, judgment, decree or memorandum by

                  Code Section 1361(a). A valid election under Code Section 1362
                  (and a comparable election under state or local law in each
                  jurisdiction where RIG is required to file Tax Returns and
                  reports that provides for such an election) has been in effect

                  Shareholder has filed, in a timely fashion, with each of the
                  IRS and any other applicable state taxing authority, to the

                  be, subject to Tax under Code Section 1374 or 1375 (or any
                  comparable provision of state or local law) for any period
                  prior to Closing. Further, except to the extent provided and
                  accrued in the provision for Taxes reflected on RIG's
                  Financial Statements, no additional federal, state or local
                  Tax liability will accrue to ACNB Corp for that portion of tax
                  year 2004 occurring prior to the Effective Time. The federal,
                  state and local allocable share of income to the shareholder
                  of RIG has been or will be accurately and completely stated on
                  the Forms K-1 issued by RIG to the shareholder for the tax

                  RIG to conduct its business. All policies of insurance
                  insuring RIG or its business, assets, employees, officers,
                  shareholders and directors are in full force and effect. As of
                  the date hereof, there are no claims by RIG or any RIG
                  officer, director, employee, or shareholder under any such
                  policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is
                  denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights
                  clause. At Closing, all RIG insurance policies will continue
                  in full force and effect. Schedule 5.19 lists all of RIG's
                  insurance policies.

         5.20     DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The only dividends or other
                  distributions which RIG has made on its capital stock since
                  January 31, 2003, are set forth on Schedule 5.20.

         5.37     NO UNDISCLOSED INFORMATION. No provision of this Section 5 or
                  any annex, schedule or any document agreement furnished by RIG
                  contains any untrue statement of a Material fact, or omits to

<PAGE>

                  circumstances under which such statements were made, not
                  misleading. No pre-closing investigation of RIG and its assets
                  for its business shall relieve the RIG Shareholder of their
                  indemnification and obligation under this Agreement.

         5.38     REQUIRED VOTE OF RIG SHAREHOLDER. The unanimous consent of the
                  holders of the outstanding shares of RIG Common Stock
                  approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has
                  been executed and delivered to ACNB Corp as of the date of
                  this Agreement. No other vote of the shareholders of RIG is
                  required by law, the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of
                  RIG or otherwise in order for RIG to consummate the
                  transactions contemplated hereby.

         5.39     ASSUMABILITY OF CONTRACTS AND LEASES. Except as disclosed on
                  Schedule 5.39, all contracts between RIG and any other entity
                  or person are assumable and assignable and do not contain any
                  term or provision that would accelerate or increase payments
                  that would otherwise be due by RIG to such person or entity,
                  or change or modify the provisions or terms of such leases,
                  contracts and agreements by reason of this Agreement or the
                  transactions contemplated hereby. Each lease pursuant to which
                  RIG, as lessee, leases real or personal property is valid and
                  in effect in accordance with its respective terms, and there
                  is not, under any of such leases, on the part of the lessee
                  any Material existing default or any event which with notice
                  or lapse of time, or both, would constitute such a default,
                  other than defaults which would not individually or in the
                  aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on the financial
                  condition, business, prospects, or operating results of RIG.

         5.40     REAL PROPERTY. RIG does not own any real property or interests
                  in real property, other than the leasehold interest in the
                  corporate offices. RIG has delivered to ACNB Corp complete
                  copies of all operative documents with respect to the rights
                  of RIG as to the leased properties. The leases are in full
                  force and effect and are valid and enforceable in accordance
                  with their terms. Neither the landlords, RIG nor the RIG
                  Shareholder are in default, technical or otherwise with
                  respect to their obligation pursuant to any lease and RIG has
                  not received any notices from the landlords or any
                  governmental agency that would prevent RIG from operating its
                  business at any of the leased properties.

         5.41     DISASTER RECOVERY/BACKUP SITE PLAN. RIG maintains a disaster
                  recovery plan and maintains backup files and all other backup
                  systems as required by any regulatory agencies, to implement
                  such disaster recovery plan so as to reasonably provide for
                  conducting its business promptly and in a timely manner in the
                  event of a disaster.

         5.42     FEES AND EXPENSES. Schedule 5.42 delineates all RIG fees and
                  expenses, including all attorney, accountant, advisory, and
                  brokers fees, in connection with the transactions contemplated
                  by this Agreement, including the Armor Transaction and the
                  NeSmith Transaction ("RIG Transaction Fees"). All RIG

                  shall be the responsibility of and paid by the RIG Shareholder
                  within thirty days of the Effective Date.

                  regulations thereunder as an insurance producer or agent and
                  broker. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.43, neither the
                  execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
                  of the transactions contemplated hereby will affect the
                  validity or any License currently possessed by RIG or its
                  employees, and all such Licenses will remain in full force and
                  effect after the Closing Date. Schedule 5.43 lists each state

                  a License. Schedule 5.43 also sets forth all complaints,
                  formal or informal, filed or alleged against RIG and/or its
                  current or former employees with the Maryland Insurance
                  Department and/or any of the insurance entities that RIG
                  represents or represented.

                  methodologies and in accordance with sound loss reserving
                  principles, consistently applied; provided that the foregoing
                  representation does not and is not intended to constitute in

                  of Acquisition Subsidiary, to the extent that such books and
                  records relate to a Pre-Closing Period, and personnel, for the
                  purpose of enabling the RIG Shareholder to: (i) prepare Tax
                  Returns, (ii) investigate or contest any tax matter which the
                  RIG Shareholder has the authority to conduct, and (iii)

                  Acquisition Subsidiary at ACNB Corp's sole discretion and RIG
                  and the RIG Shareholders shall take all actions necessary or
                  advisable to consummate such merger. The merger of RIG into
                  Acquisition Subsidiary will not constitute a change in control
                  nor trigger any rights to payment under the respective
                  Employment Agreement attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 1 .

         6.19     TAX RETURNS AND TAX AUDITS. RIG shall prepare or cause to be

                  are filed after the Effective Date. The Tax Returns shall
                  conform to RIG's historical tax treatment and be consistent
                  with past practice. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by

                  with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Subsection
                  6.19, and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
                  respect to such Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
                  retention and (upon any Party's request) the provision of

                  Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disclosures made
                  subsequent to the date of this Agreement shall not relieve

                  and disclosures to RIG and the RIG Shareholder.

         7.4      NOTICE. ACNB Corp shall promptly notify RIG in writing of any
                  actions, claims, investigations or other developments which,
                  if pending or in existence on the date of this Agreement,

                           consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
                           Agreement.

         9.1      by the mutual written consent of the Parties hereto;

         9.2      by RIG, if (i) by written notice to ACNB Corp that there has
                  been a Material breach of any obligation of ACNB Corp
                  contained herein and such breach has not been remedied within
                  twenty (20) days after receipt by ACNB Corp of written notice
                  specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be
                  remedied or (ii) by written notice to ACNB Corp that any
                  condition in Subsections 8.1 and 8.3 to RIG's obligations
                  hereunder has not been satisfied prior to Closing or such
                  earlier date as may be specified herein;

         9.3      (a) by ACNB Corp, if (i) by written notice to RIG that there
                  has been a Material breach of any obligation of RIG contained
                  herein and such breach has not been remedied within twenty
                  (20) days after receipt by RIG of written notice specifying
                  the nature of such breach and requesting that it be remedied
                  (ii) by written notice to RIG that any condition in
                  Subsections 8.1 and 8.2 to ACNB Corp's obligations hereunder
                  has not been satisfied prior to Closing or such earlier date
                  as may be specified herein or (iii) by written notice to RIG
                  if any matter has come to the attention of ACNB in the course

                  respect to the Armor Transaction or the NeSmith Transaction
                  that, in ACNB's sole opinion, that leads ACNB to believe that
                  it would be inadvisable for ACNB in ACNB's sole and exclusive
                  judgment, to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement; (b) for the purpose of Section 9.3(a)(i) the
                  failure to Close by December 31, 2004 in and of itself will
                  not be a Material breach.

         9.4      by ACNB Corp or RIG, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
                  or prior to December 31, 2004, unless the failure of such
                  occurrence shall be due to the Material failure of the Party
                  seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe its
                  agreements as set forth in this Agreement required to be
                  performed or observed by such Party on or before the Closing;
                  provided, however, that such date may be extended by the
                  written agreement of the Parties; or

         9.5      by ACNB Corp or RIG, if the conditions set forth in Subsection
                  8.1(2) are unable to be fulfilled as a result of either
                  Party's inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and
                  consents by December 31, 2004; provided, however, that such
                  date may be extended by the written agreement of the Parties.


                        SECTION 10. EFFECT OF TERMINATION

         10.1     EFFECT. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
                  provided above, this Agreement shall immediately become null
                  and void and the transactions contemplated herein shall
                  thereupon be abandoned, except that the provisions relating to
                  brokers Subsections 4.8 and 5.16, limited liability Subsection
                  10.2, confidentiality Subsection 10.3, publicity Section 18,
                  and expenses Section 11 of this Agreement shall survive.

         10.2     LIMITED LIABILITY. The termination of this Agreement in
                  accordance with the terms of Section 9 shall create no
                  liability on the part of any Party, or on the part of any
                  Party's directors, officers, shareholders, agents or
                  representatives, except that if this Agreement is terminated
                  by ACNB Corp by reason of a Material breach by RIG, or if this
                  Agreement is terminated by RIG by reason of a Material breach
                  by ACNB Corp, the breaching Party shall be liable to the
                  nonbreaching Party or Parties for all costs or such liability
                  as may be pursued and found as a matter of law or in equity,
                  including but not limited to, reasonable out-of-pocket costs
                  and expenses reasonably incurred by the nonbreaching Party or
                  Parties in connection with the preparation, execution and
                  consummation of this Agreement, including the fees of its or
                  their counsel, accountants, consultants and other
                  representatives.

         10.3     CONFIDENTIALITY. In the event of the termination of this
                  Agreement, neither ACNB Corp nor RIG shall use or disclose to
                  any other person any confidential information obtained by it
                  during the course of its investigation of the other party or
                  parties.


                              SECTION 11. EXPENSES

         11.1     Each Party hereto will bear all expenses incurred by it in
                  connection with this Agreement and the transactions
                  contemplated hereby. In the event of termination of this


                                       54

<PAGE>

                  Agreement pursuant to Section 9, this Agreement shall
                  thereafter become void and there shall be no liability on the
                  part of any Party hereto or their respective officers or
                  directors, except as provided in Subsections 10.2 and 10.3 and
                  11.2 hereof, and except that any such termination shall be
                  without prejudice to the rights of any Party hereto arising
                  out of the intentional or willful breach of any covenant or
                  intentional or willful misrepresentation contained in this
                  Agreement by any other Party hereto.

         11.2     So long as ACNB Corp shall not have breached its obligations
                  hereunder, if this Agreement is terminated by ACNB Corp
                  pursuant to Subsection 9.3(i), RIG shall promptly, but in no
                  event later than thirty (30) business days after such
                  termination, pay ACNB Corp a fee of $250,000, which amount
                  shall be payable by check and shall be liquidated and
                  exclusive damages. If RIG fails to promptly pay the amount due
                  pursuant to this Subsection 11.2, and, in order to obtain
                  payment, ACNB Corp commences a suit which results in judgment
                  against RIG for all or a substantial portion of the fee set
                  forth in this Subsection 11.2, RIG shall pay to ACNB Corp all
                  costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees)
                  incurred by ACNB Corp in connection with such suit.

         11.3     INTENTIONALLY OMITTED..

                           SECTION 12. CONFIDENTIALITY

         Any non-public or confidential information disclosed by RIG, the RIG
Shareholder or by ACNB Corp pursuant to this Agreement or as a result of the
discussions and negotiations leading to this Agreement, or otherwise disclosed,
or to which any other party has acquired or may acquire access, and indicated
(either expressly, in writing or orally, or by the context of the disclosure or
access) by the disclosing Party to be non-public or confidential, or which by
the context thereof reasonably appears to be non-public or confidential, shall
be kept strictly confidential and shall not be used in any manner by the
recipient except in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To that end, the Parties hereto will each, to the maximum extent
practicable, restrict knowledge of and access to non-public or confidential
information of the other Party to its officers, directors, employees and
professional advisors who are directly involved in the transactions contemplated
hereby and reasonably need to know such information. Further to that end, all
non-public or confidential documents (including all copies thereof) obtained or
created hereunder by any Party shall be returned as soon as practicable after
any termination of this Agreement.

                      SECTION 13.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS
                              AND WARRANTIES, ETC.

         Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13, the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 4 and 5 hereof shall be deemed to have been
relied upon by the Party to whom they are made and shall survive Closing unless
by their terms, an earlier time is specified. All covenants and duties which
relate to a time after Closing, including but not limited to those contained in
Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 6.11, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, 6.18, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 27 shall survive Closing and all other
covenants and duties which do not relate to a time after Closing shall not
survive Closing. No investigation made by or on behalf of either Party shall
affect the representations and warranties made pursuant to this Agreement.

                              SECTION 14. EMPLOYEES

         14.1     Except as may be otherwise specifically agreed to in writing
                  by the Parties and subject to ACNB Corp's satisfactory review
                  of personnel records, ACNB Corp and any of its affiliates
                  (collectively, the "ACNB Corp Affiliates") shall continue to
                  employ all persons who are officers and employees of RIG
                  immediately before the Effective Time as officers and
                  employees of RIG or an ACNB Corp Affiliate immediately
                  following the Effective Time. Except for Frank C. Russell,
                  Jr., the hired officers and employees will be employees'
                  at-will with no express or implied right to continued
                  employment. It shall be a condition to employment by ACNB Corp
                  or any ACNB Corp Affiliate that any former officer or employee
                  of RIG agree to cancel any existing employment contract,
                  agreement or understanding between him or herself and RIG,
                  including, without limitation, all benefits related to
                  severance arrangements, bonuses, upon a change of control or
                  otherwise and release ACNB Corp, ACNB Corp Affiliates and RIG
                  from all contractual obligations under such agreements, prior
                  to accepting such new employment and without accepting any of
                  the severance benefits or other benefits or payments
                  associated with such contract, agreement or understanding.

         14.2     ACNB Corp reserves any and all rights it may have regarding
                  modification, amendment or termination of RIG's present
                  health, welfare, benefit, pension and profit sharing plans.
                  Any rights that ACNB Corp has to modify, amend or terminate
                  such plans are unconditional if they are done to alleviate or
                  correct any problems or deficiencies in the structure or
                  administration of the plans. All other modifications,
                  amendments or terminations of the plans are subject to the
                  plans remaining, in the aggregate, at least equal to or better
                  than RIG's existing plans.

                           SECTION 16. INDEMNIFICATION

         16.1     From and for 3 years after the Effective Time, subject to the
                  terms and conditions of this Agreement, the RIG Shareholder
                  shall indemnify and hold harmless ACNB Corp from and against
                  any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages, judgments,
                  settlements, penalties, fines, interest, obligations or
                  expenses of any kind whatsoever (including, without
                  limitation, reasonable attorneys' accountants', consultants'
                  or experts' fees and disbursements) ("Losses") which ACNB Corp
                  or any of its affiliates actually suffers, incurs or sustains
                  arising out of or attributable to (whether or not arising out
                  of third party claims) (i) any breach of any representation or
                  warranty made by RIG or the RIG Shareholder in this Agreement,
                  (ii) any breach of any covenant to be performed by RIG or the
                  RIG Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) any Loss
                  incurred by ACNB Corp in respect of any legal, administrative,
                  arbitral, governmental or other proceedings, actions or
                  governmental investigations of any nature ("Legal
                  Proceedings") in progress, open, pending or threatened on the
                  Effective Time and (iv) any actions, suits or proceedings,
                  whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
                  (including an action by or in the right of the corporation),
                  commenced on or after the Effective Date which relate to
                  facts, circumstances, events or actions on or prior to the
                  Effective Date against ACNB Corp, brought by reason of the
                  fact that ACNB Corp is a successor by operation of law to RIG.

         16.2     The RIG Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless ACNB
                  Corp from and against any Losses, that ACNB Corp may sustain
                  or become subject to as a result of the assertion against ACNB
                  Corp of any liability or obligation with respect to any and
                  all taxes, charges, fees, levies, penalties or other
                  assessments imposed by any United States federal, state, local
                  or foreign taxing authority, including, but not limited to,
                  income, excise, property, sales, transfer, franchise payroll,
                  gains, withholding, ad valorem, social security, surplus lines
                  or other taxes, including any interest penalties or additions
                  attributable thereto ("Taxes") attributable to RIG prior to
                  the Effective Date. This Section 16.2 and the obligations
                  hereunder shall be, and continue without limitation and shall
                  not be subject to any of the limitations on time or amounts as
                  set forth in this Section 16.


         16.3     (I) The RIG Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless ACNB
                  Corp and its assigns, successors, affiliates, directors,
                  officers and representatives from any and all Losses resulting
                  from or in connection with any investigation, litigation,
                  claims, suits and causes of action that are associated with or
                  arise from the criminal investigation of William Miller and
                  the administrative order previously issued or the facts


                                       57
<PAGE>

                  associated therewith. Further, the RIG Shareholder shall fully
                  cooperate in any manner with regard to defending any
                  litigation, claims, suits and causes of action that are
                  associated with William Miller. This Section 16.3(i) and the
                  obligations hereunder shall be, and continue without
                  limitation and shall not be subject to any of the limitations
                  on time or amounts as set forth in this Section 16.

                  (II) The RIG Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless
                  ACNB Corp and its assigns, successors, affiliates, directors,
                  officers and representatives from any and all Losses resulting
                  from or in connection with any investigation, litigation,
                  claims, suits and causes of action or UCC Financing Statements
                  that are associated with or arise from the contracts entered
                  into by and between Frank C, Russell, Jr, RIG and Norvergence
                  or any further assignment of such contracts; or contracts
                  entered into by and between Frank C, Russell, Jr, RIG and
                  Continental Casualty Company or any further assignment of such
                  contracts. This Section 16.3(ii) and the obligations hereunder
                  shall be, and continue without limitation and shall not be
                  subject to any of the limitations on time or amounts as set
                  forth in this Section 16.

         16.4     From and for 3 years after the Effective Time, subject to the
                  terms and conditions of this Agreement, ACNB Corp shall
                  indemnify and hold harmless, the RIG Shareholder from and
                  against any and all Losses which either actually suffers,
                  incurs or sustains arising out of or attributable to (whether
                  or not arising out of third party claims) (i) any breach of
                  any representation or warranty made by ACNB Corp in this
                  Agreement (ii) any breach of any covenant to be performed by
                  ACNB Corp pursuant to this Agreement.

         16.5     The indemnified Party shall promptly notify the indemnifying
                  Party of the discovery by it of, or the assertion against it
                  of, any claim or potential liability for which indemnification
                  is provided herein or the commencement of any action or
                  proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought
                  hereunder; provided, however; that the failure promptly to
                  give such notice shall affect any indemnified Party's rights
                  hereunder only to the extent that such failure shall (i)
                  actually materially and adversely affect any indemnifying
                  Party or its rights hereunder or (ii) result in the
                  indemnified Party failing to give notice of a claim for
                  indemnification prior to the expiration of the survival period
                  set forth in Section 16 hereof to which the claim relates.

         16.6     The right of an indemnified Party under this Section 16 shall
                  be subject to the following conditions and limitations: (1)
                  notice of any claim for indemnification under Section 16 shall
                  have been given prior to the expiration of the survival period
                  set forth in Subsections 16.1 and 16.4; (2) notice of any
                  claim for indemnification with respect to Taxes and Losses
                  attributable thereto, as set forth in Subsection 16.1 and
                  Subsection 16.4, shall have been given prior to the expiration
                  of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any

                                       58
<PAGE>

                  extensions thereof) for the assertion of claims by the
                  relevant tax authority; and (3) with respect to a claim for
                  indemnification arising out of or involving an assertion by a
                  third party of liability on the part of an indemnified Party,
                  the indemnified Party shall advise the indemnifying Party of
                  all facts relating to such assertion within the knowledge of
                  the indemnified Party, and shall afford the indemnifying Party
                  the opportunity, at the indemnifying Party's cost and expense,
                  to defend against such claims for liability; in any such
                  action or proceeding, the indemnified Party shall have the
                  right to retain its own counsel and to participate in the
                  defense, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
                  the expense of the indemnified Party unless (1) the
                  indemnifying Party and indemnified Party mutually agree in
                  writing to the retention of such counsel or (2) in the
                  reasonable judgment of counsel for the indemnifying Party,
                  representation of the indemnifying Party and the indemnified
                  Party by the same counsel would be inadvisable due to actual
                  or potential differing or conflicts of interest between them.

         16.7     Except in connection with the obligations under Sections 16.2
                  and 16.3(i) and 16.3(ii):

                  (a)      Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
                           contained herein and in addition to any of the other
                           conditions, limitations and exclusions set forth
                           herein, the RIG Shareholder shall not be required to
                           indemnify ACNB Corp, and neither ACNB Corp shall seek
                           indemnity from the RIG Shareholder for Losses for
                           which ACNB Corp is indemnified by any Person who is
                           not affiliated with a Party, whether pursuant to an
                           insurance policy, guarantee or otherwise.

                  (b)      The indemnification obligations under this Section
                           shall be net of any indemnity, contribution, or
                           similar payments received hereunder from any third
                           party not affiliated with a Party with respect to
                           Losses indemnified hereunder.

         16.8     The indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle or
                  compromise any claim or liability subject to indemnification
                  under this Section 16 which is susceptible to being settled or
                  compromised, provided, however, that any such settlement shall
                  require the consent of the indemnified Party, which consent
                  shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided further however,
                  that the consent of the indemnified Party shall not be
                  required if (i) the terms of the settlement require only the
                  payment of damages and payment of the full amount of the
                  relevant indemnification obligation to the indemnified Party
                  is assured and (ii) the indemnified Party is not otherwise
                  materially and adversely affected by the terms of the
                  settlement.

         16.9     For the limited purposes of determining the RIG Shareholder's
                  indemnification obligations under this Section 16, the
                  "materiality" test set up by the use of the terms material,
                  materially, material adverse effect or similar words to that

                                       59
<PAGE>

                  effect in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been met
                  where a Party has incurred, suffered or sustained an actual
                  Loss.

         16.10    The time periods and amounts for indemnification under this
                  Section 16 shall be unlimited if Losses or Taxes are the
                  result of or caused by fraud, the intentional or willful
                  actions, or criminal actions on the part of a Party. In
                  addition, the rights of a Party shall be unlimited in
                  connection with Losses that are caused by or the result of
                  fraud, the intentional and willful actions, or criminal
                  actions on the part of the other Party. In the case of willful
                  and intentional actions such actions require the actual
                  knowledge by the Party that (i) in the case of a breach of
                  representation or warranty that such representation or
                  warranty was materially inaccurate at the time it was made,
                  and (ii) in the case of a material breach of a covenant that
                  such action or inaction that caused the breach was taken or
                  not taken with the intent to take or not take said action. The
                  indemnification provisions of Section 16 are in addition to,
                  and not in derogation of, any statutory, equitable, or common
                  law remedy any Party may have in connection with matters
                  within Section 16.10 of this Agreement.

         16.11    The RIG Shareholder shall obtain and maintain an errors and
                  omissions insurance "tail coverage" policy for three years
                  after the Effective Time that will include the directors and
                  officers of RIG.

         16.12    The RIG Shareholder hereby agrees that he will not make any
                  claim for indemnification against ACNB Corp by reason of the
                  fact that he was a shareholder, director, officer, employee,
                  or agent of RIG or was serving at the request of such entity
                  as a partner, trustee, shareholder, director, officer,
                  employee, or agent of another entity, whether such claim is
                  for judgments, damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid
                  in settlement, losses, expenses, or otherwise and whether such
                  claim is pursuant to any statute, charter, complaint, claim or
                  demand brought by ACNB Corp against such RIG Shareholder
                  (whether such action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim, or
                  demand is pursuant to this Agreement, applicable law, or
                  otherwise).

         16.13    (a) Except as provided in Subsections 16.2 and 16.3(i) and
                  16.3(ii), the RIG Shareholder shall have no liability (for
                  indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the matters
                  described in this Section until the total of all Losses with
                  respect to such matters exceeds $50,000, and then only for the
                  amount by which such Losses exceed $50,000.

                  (b) Except as provided in Subsections 16.2 and 16.3(i) and
                  16.3(ii), notwithstanding any other provisions of this
                  Agreement or any other document, the maximum aggregate
                  liability of the RIG Shareholder under this Agreement shall be
                  one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the aggregate
                  Purchase Price Consideration actually received by the RIG
                  Shareholder.

         16.14    If ACNB Corp proposes to set-off against the Contingent Cash
                  Consideration earned with respect to the indemnification
                  obligations of the RIG Shareholder, then ACNB Corp and the RIG
                  Shareholder shall attempt to mutually agree on the amount of
                  the scheduled amount of the Contingent Cash Consideration to
                  be set-off.

                 AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT


         This AMENDMENT NO. 1 to THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, is dated as of
December 31, 2004 (the "Amendment"), and entered into among ACNB Acquisition
Subsidiary LLC, a Maryland limited liability company ("Acquisition Subsidiary"),
ACNB Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("ACNB"), Russell Insurance Group,
Inc. ("RIG"), a Maryland corporation and Frank C. Russell, Jr., an adult
individual ("Seller" or the "RIG Shareholder") (each a "Party") (all parties are
collectively referred to as the "Parties").

         WHEREAS, the Parties entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as
of November 19, 2004 (the "Agreement");

         WHEREAS, the Parties hereto wish to modify and amend the Agreement as
set forth herein;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, covenants and
agreements hereinafter set forth, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Amendment to Section 2.1 of the Agreement.

Section 2.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows:

         Provided that all conditions precedent set forth in this Agreement
         shall have been satisfied or shall have been waived in accordance with
         Section 19 of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the
         offices of ACNB Corp, 16 Lincoln Square, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, or
         such other mutually agreed upon location, on such date and at such time
         as shall be agreed upon by the Parties, which date shall, unless
         otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, be the first business day of a
         calendar month and not be later than the 15th business day after the
         last approval of required governmental authorities is granted and any
         related waiting periods expire, but in no event later then January 7,
         2005, unless extended by both Parties in writing. At the Closing, the
         Parties shall deliver the certificates required by Sections 8.2(1) and
         8.3(1) of this Agreement, the tax forms required by Section 6.14 and
         such other documents and instruments as may be necessary or appropriate
         to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement.


2. Amendment to Section 9.3 of the Agreement.

Section 9.3 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows:



                  (a) by ACNB Corp, if (i) by written notice to RIG that there
                  has been a Material breach of any obligation of RIG contained
                  herein and such breach has not been remedied within twenty
                  (20) days after receipt by RIG of written notice specifying
                  the nature of such breach and requesting that it be remedied
                  (ii) by written notice to RIG that any condition in

<PAGE>

                  Subsections 8.1 and 8.2 to ACNB Corp's obligations hereunder
                  has not been satisfied prior to Closing or such earlier date
                  as may be specified herein or (iii) by written notice to RIG
                  if any matter has come to the attention of ACNB in the course
                  of their due diligence investigation, or otherwise, with
                  respect to the Armor Transaction or the NeSmith Transaction
                  that, in ACNB's sole opinion, that leads ACNB to believe that
                  it would be inadvisable for ACNB in ACNB's sole and exclusive
                  judgment, to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
                  this Agreement; (b) for the purpose of Section 9.3(a)(i) the
                  failure to Close by January 7, 2005 in and of itself will not
                  be a Material breach.

3. Amendment to Section 9.4 of the Agreement.

Section 9.4 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows:

                  by ACNB Corp or RIG, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
                  or prior to January 7, 2005, unless the failure of such
                  occurrence shall be due to the Material failure of the Party
                  seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe its
                  agreements as set forth in this Agreement required to be
                  performed or observed by such Party on or before the Closing;
                  provided, however, that such date may be extended by the
                  written agreement of the Parties; or

4. Amendment to Section 9.5 of the Agreement.

Section 9.5 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows:

                  by ACNB Corp or RIG, if the conditions set forth in Subsection
                  8.1(2) are unable to be fulfilled as a result of either
                  Party's inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and
                  consents by January 7, 2005; provided, however, that such date
                  may be extended by the written agreement of the Parties.

5. Miscellaneous.

(a) The Agreement is incorporated herein by reference.

(b) Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Agreement, as amended hereby,
shall remain in full force and effect and the Parties shall have all the rights
and remedies provided thereunder with the same force and effect as if the
Agreement was restated herein in its entirety.

(c) The provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective executors, heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns.

(d) This Amendment may be executed and delivered in several counterparts with
the intention that all such counterparts, when taken together, constitute one
and the same instrument.

<PAGE>


6.       This Amendment shall constitute an amendment to the Agreement in
accordance with Section 19 of the Agreement.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Amendment as
