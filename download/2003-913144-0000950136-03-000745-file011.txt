                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:

         A. The Account Parties have requested that the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders make available to the Account Parties a secured letter of credit
facility in an initial amount of up to $385,000,000 to provide for the issuance
of letters of credit for the account of one or more of the Account Parties. The
Issuing Bank and the Lenders have indicated their willingness to agree to make
such letters of credit available on the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, including the requirement that each Account
Party fully collateralize its several letter of credit obligations with a
perfected first priority security interest in satisfactory collateral, including
cash, eligible marketable securities and (so long as certain conditions are met)
Redeemable Preference Shares of Renaissance Investment Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda
company ("RIHL").

         B. Each of the Account Parties is a holder of such Redeemable
Preference Shares, and wishes to pledge sufficient Redeemable Preference Shares
to the Collateral Agent to secure such Account Party's obligations to the Agents
and the Lenders in connection with this letter of credit facility. Each Account
Party's Redeemable Preference Shares are held in a separate custodial account
with Mellon and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent pursuant to a Pledge
Agreement in favor of the Collateral Agent for such Account Party, and a related
Control Agreement among such Account Party, Mellon and the Collateral Agent.

         C. RIHL's sole business is to invest in a portfolio of high quality

will provide certain undertakings to the Agents and Lenders pursuant to the RIHL
Agreement in support of this letter of credit facility, including maintenance of
its status as a single purpose company and its agreement to redeem the pledged
Redeemable Preference Shares as required by the Collateral Agent after the
occurrence of certain events.

                                       1

         D. RIHL will also agree in the RIHL Agreement to guarantee the
obligations of one or more of the Account Parties under this letter of credit
facility upon the occurrence of certain events with respect to RIHL or the
Account Parties. RIHL will secure its obligations under such guaranty by
pledging an allocable portion of RIHL's assets to the Collateral Agent pursuant
to the RIHL Pledge Agreement in favor of the Collateral Agent, and a related
Control Agreement among RIHL, Mellon and the Collateral Agent

         E. All of the common shares of RIHL are owned by RenRe, and the
day-to-day investment activities of RIHL are managed by Renaissance Underwriting
Managers Ltd., a Bermuda company ("RUM"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of
RenRe. RenRe and RUM will provide certain undertakings to the Agents and Lenders
pursuant to the RenRe Agreement in support of this letter of credit facility,
including exercise of their control over RIHL to cause RIHL to comply with its
obligations under the Credit Documents and maintenance of RIHL's status as a
single purpose company.

Requirement of Law applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive

Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such

Letter of Credit would violate the provisions of subsection (a) above.

Reimbursement.

         (a) Request for Issuance. RenRe, on behalf of an Applicable Account
Party, may from time to time request, upon at least three Business Days' notice
(given not later than 11:00 A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the last day
permitted therefor), the Issuing Bank to issue or renew (other than any
automatic renewal thereof) a Letter of Credit by:

             (i) delivering to the Issuing Bank, with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent, either (x) a written request to such effect or
         (y) a request made in electronic form through the Issuing Bank's remote
         access system and in accordance with the terms and conditions
         (including any written agreements between the Issuing Bank and RenRe or
         the Applicable Account Party) applicable thereto, in each case
         specifying the date on which such Letter of Credit is to be issued
         (which shall be a Business Day), the expiration date thereof, the
         Available Amount thereof, the name and address of the beneficiary
         thereof and the requested form thereof, and in each case with a copy of
         such request (or, in the

                                       21
<PAGE>

         case of clause (y) above, a written or electronic summary thereof) to
         the Administrative Agent; and

             (ii) in the case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, delivering
         to the Issuing Bank a completed agreement and application with respect
         to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank may specify for use in
         connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a "Letter of Credit
         Agreement"), together with such other certificates, documents and other
         papers or information as are specified in such Letter of Credit
         Agreement or as may be required pursuant to the Issuing Bank's
         customary practices for the issuance of letters of credit (including
         requirements relating to requests made through the Issuing Bank's
         remote access system).

In addition, RenRe shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Collateral Value
Report not later than 11:00 A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the Business
Day immediately preceding the date on which such Letter of Credit is to be
issued.

The Administrative Agent shall, promptly upon receiving a copy of the notice
referred to in clause (i) above, notify the Lenders of such proposed Letter of
Credit or such proposed renewal of a Letter of Credit, and shall determine, as
of 11:00 A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the Business Day immediately
preceding such proposed issuance, whether such proposed Letter of Credit
complies with the conditions set forth in SECTION 2.01 hereof. If such
conditions set forth in SECTION 2.01 are not satisfied or if the Required
Lenders have given notice to the Administrative Agent to cease issuing or
renewing Letters of Credit as contemplated by this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent shall immediately notify the Issuing Bank (in writing or by telephone
immediately confirmed in writing) that the Issuing Bank is not authorized to
issue or renew, as the case may be, such Letter of Credit. If the Issuing Bank
issues or renews a Letter of Credit, it shall deliver the original of such
Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as RenRe, on behalf of the
Applicable Account Party, shall otherwise direct, and shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent thereof and furnish a copy thereof to the Administrative
Agent. The Issuing Bank may issue Letters of Credit through any of its branches
or Affiliates (whether domestic or foreign) that issue letters of credit, and
RenRe and each Account Party authorizes and directs the Issuing Bank to select
the branch or Affiliate that will issue or process any Letter of Credit.

         (b) Request for Extension or Increase. RenRe, on behalf of an Account
Party, may from time to time request the Issuing Bank to extend the expiration
date of an outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its account or increase (or,
with the consent of the beneficiary, decrease) the Available Amount of such
Letter of Credit. Such extension or increase shall for all purposes hereunder
(including for purposes of SECTION 2.01 and SECTION 2.02(a)) be treated as
though such Account Party had requested issuance of a new or replacement Letter
of Credit (except only that the Issuing Bank may, if it elects, issue a notice
of extension or increase in lieu of issuing a new Letter of Credit in
substitution for the outstanding Letter of Credit).

         (c) Limitations on Issuance, Extension, Renewal and Amendment. As
between the Issuing Bank, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on
the other hand, the Issuing Bank shall be justified and fully protected in
issuing or renewing a Letter of Credit unless it shall have received notice from
the Administrative Agent as provided in SECTION 2.02(a) hereof that it

                                       22
<PAGE>

is not authorized to do so (and, in the case of automatic renewals, ten days
shall have passed following the date of the Issuing Bank's receipt of such
notice), notwithstanding any subsequent notices to the Issuing Bank, any
knowledge of a Suspension Event or a Default or Event of Default, any knowledge
of failure of any condition specified in ARTICLE III to be satisfied, any other
knowledge of the Issuing Bank, or any other event, condition or circumstance
whatsoever. The Issuing Bank may amend, modify or supplement Letters of Credit
or Letter of Credit Agreements without the consent of, and without liability to,
any Agent or any Lender, provided that any such amendment, modification or
supplement that extends the expiration date of, or increases the Available
Amount of or the amount available to be drawn on, an outstanding Letter of
Credit shall be subject to SECTION 2.01. With respect to each Letter of Credit
that remains outstanding at any time after the Expiration Date and that provides
by its terms for automatic renewal, the Issuing Bank shall notify the
beneficiary thereof, in accordance with the terms specified for such notice in
such Letter of Credit, of the Issuing Bank's election not to renew such Letter
of Credit.

         (d) Letter of Credit Participating Interests. Concurrently with the
issuance of each Letter of Credit and without any further action by any party to
this Agreement, the Issuing Bank automatically shall be deemed, irrevocably and
unconditionally, to have sold, assigned, transferred and conveyed to each other
Lender, and each other Lender automatically shall be deemed, irrevocably and
unconditionally, severally to have purchased, acquired, accepted and assumed
from the Issuing Bank, without recourse to, or representation or warranty by,
the Issuing Bank, an undivided interest, in a proportion equal to such Lender's
Pro Rata Share, in all of the Issuing Bank's rights and obligations in, to or
under such Letter of Credit, the related Letter of Credit Agreement, each
drawing made thereunder, all obligations of the Applicable Account Party under
the Credit Documents with respect to such Letter of Credit, and all Collateral,
guarantees and other rights from time to time directly or indirectly securing
the foregoing (such interest of each Lender being referred to herein as a
"Letter of Credit Participating Interest"); provided, however, that the fees and
charges relating to Letters of Credit described in SECTION 2.05(c)(ii) and (iii)
shall be payable directly to the Issuing Bank as provided therein, and the
Lenders shall have no right to receive any portion thereof. Each Lender
irrevocably and unconditionally accepts and agrees to the terms set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, such agreement being herein referred to as such
Lender's "Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitment". Upon any change
in the Commitments of any of the Lenders pursuant to SECTION 9.05, with respect
to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Reimbursement Obligations there shall
be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section to
reflect the new pro rata shares of the assigning Lender and the Assignee. On the
date that any New Lender becomes a party to this Agreement in accordance with
SECTION 2.18, Letter of Credit Participating Interests in all outstanding
Letters of Credit held by each of the Lenders (other than the New Lender) shall
be proportionately reallocated between such New Lender and the existing Lenders.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, each Lender hereby agrees that its
obligation to participate in each Letter of Credit, its obligation to make the
payments specified in SECTION 2.02(e), and the right of the Issuing Bank to
receive such payments in the manner specified therein, are each absolute,
irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be affected by any event, condition
or circumstance whatever. The failure of any Lender to make any such payment
shall not relieve any other Lender of its funding obligation hereunder on the
date due, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender
to meet its funding obligations hereunder.

         (e) Payment by Lenders on Account of Unreimbursed Draws. If the Issuing
Bank makes a payment under any Letter of Credit and is not reimbursed in full on
the date of such payment in accordance with SECTION 2.03(a), the Issuing Bank
may notify the Administrative Agent thereof (which notice may be by telephone),
and the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify each Lender (which notice
may be by telephone promptly confirmed in writing) thereof. No later than the
Administrative Agent's close of business on the date such notice is given (if
notice is given by 2:00 P.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time) or 10:00 A.M.
Charlotte, North Carolina time the following day (if notice is given after 2:00
P.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time or in the case of any Lender whose Lending
Office is located in Europe), each Lender will pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds, an amount
equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the unreimbursed portion of such
payment by the Issuing Bank. Amounts received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Issuing Bank shall be forthwith transferred, in immediately
available funds, to the Issuing Bank. If and to the extent that any Lender fails
to make such payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Bank on such date, such Lender shall pay such amount on demand, together with
interest, for the Issuing Bank's own account, for each day from and including
the date such payment is due from such Lender to the Issuing Bank to but not
including the date of repayment to the Issuing Bank (before and after judgment)
at a rate per annum for each day (i) from and including the date of payment by
the Issuing Bank to and including the date such payment is due from such Lender
equal to the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) thereafter equal to the rate of
interest payable by the Applicable Account Party under SECTION 2.03(a)(i). For
avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed by the Lenders that Letters of
Credit issued prior to the Expiration Date may, by their terms, remain
outstanding after the Expiration Date and that the obligations of the Lenders to
make payments under this SECTION 2.02(e) shall continue from and after the
Expiration Date until the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit,
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

         (f) Letter of Credit Advances. The term "Letter of Credit Advance" is
used in this Agreement in accordance with the meanings set forth in this SECTION
2.02(f). The making of any payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
is sometimes referred to herein as the making of a Letter of Credit Advance by
the Issuing Bank in the amount of such payment. The making of any payment by a
Lender for the account of the Issuing Bank under SECTION 2.02(e) on account of
an unreimbursed drawing on a Letter of Credit is also sometimes referred to
herein as the making of a Letter of Credit Advance to the Applicable Account
Party by such Lender. The making of such a Letter of Credit Advance by a Lender
with respect to an unreimbursed drawing on a Letter of Credit shall reduce, by a
like amount, the outstanding Letter of Credit Advance of the Issuing Bank with
respect to such unreimbursed drawing.

         (g) Letter of Credit Reports. The Issuing Bank will furnish to the
Administrative Agent prompt written notice of each issuance or renewal of a
Letter of Credit (including the Available Amount and expiration date thereof),
amendment to a Letter of Credit, cancellation of a Letter of Credit and payment
on a Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent will furnish to each Lender
prior to the tenth Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report (i)
summarizing issuance, renewal and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued
or renewed during the preceding calendar quarter, (ii) identifying payments and
reductions in Available Amount during such calendar quarter and (iii) setting
forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during such calendar quarter.

         Section 2.03 Repayment of Letter of Credit Advances.

         (a) Account Parties' Reimbursement Obligation.

             (i) Each Account Party hereby severally agrees to reimburse the
         Issuing Bank in immediately available funds (by making payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank in accordance
         with SECTION 2.07) in the amount of each payment made by the Issuing
         Bank under any Letter of Credit issued for such Account Party's account
         (each such amount so paid until reimbursed, together with interest
         thereon payable as provided hereinbelow, a "Reimbursement Obligation")
         no later than the third succeeding Business Day (the "Due Date") after
         the date such payment under such Letter of Credit is made by the
         Issuing Bank (the "Draw Date"), together with interest as provided
         below on the amount so paid by the Issuing Bank (to the extent not
         reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the
         Draw Date) for the period from the Draw Date to the date the
         Reimbursement Obligation created thereby is satisfied in full (the
         "Payment Date"). If the Payment Date is on or prior to the Due Date,
         such interest shall be payable at the Base Rate as in effect from time
         to time during the period from the Draw Date to the Payment Date. If
         the Payment Date is after the Due Date, such interest shall be payable
         (x) at the Base Rate as in effect from time to time during the period
         from and including the Draw Date to and not including the Payment Date,
         and (y) at the Base Rate as in effect from time to time plus 2% from
         and including the Due Date to and not including the Payment Date. All
         such interest shall also be payable on demand. The Issuing Bank will
         provide the Administrative Agent, RenRe and the Applicable Account
         Party with prompt notice of any payment or disbursement made under any
         Letter of Credit, although the failure to give, or any delay in giving,
         any such notice shall not release, diminish or otherwise affect the
         Applicable Account Party's obligations under this Section or any other
         provision of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay
         to the Issuing Bank and the Lenders which have funded their respective
         shares of Reimbursement Obligation remaining unpaid by such Account
         Party any such amounts received by it under this Section. Such
         reimbursement obligation shall be payable without further notice,
         protest or demand, all of which are hereby waived, and an action
         therefor shall immediately accrue. Each Account Party acknowledges and
         agrees that it has in its Control Agreement unconditionally and
         irrevocably authorized the Collateral Agent to instruct the Custodian
         to redeem Redeemable Preference Shares or obtain and apply other
         Collateral of such Account Party to the payment of any Reimbursement
         Obligation not paid in full on the Draw Date as directed by the
         Collateral Agent; provided that, with respect to any Reimbursement
         Obligation of less than $25,000,000, the Collateral Agent shall not
         give the instruction for such a redemption if RenRe shall have given
         notice to the Administrative Agent on or before the Business Day first
         succeeding the Draw Date that the Reimbursement Obligation will be paid
         in cash on or before the Due Date and thereafter such payment is made.

             (ii) The obligation of each Account Party to reimburse the Issuing
         Bank for any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of
         Credit issued for the account of such Account Party, and the obligation
         of each Lender under SECTION 2.02(e) with respect thereto, shall be
         unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in

                                       25
<PAGE>

         accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the applicable Letter of
         Credit Agreement and any other applicable agreement or instrument under
         all circumstances, including without limitation the following
         circumstances:

                  (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Credit
             Document, any Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument
             relating thereto (all of the foregoing being, collectively, the

                  (B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
             in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of any Account
             Party or any other Person in respect of any L/C Related Document or
             any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from
             all or any of the L/C Related Documents;

                  (C) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
             right that any Account Party or any other Person may have at any
             time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of
             Credit (or any Persons for which any such beneficiary or any such
             transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person,
             whether in connection with the transactions contemplated by the L/C
             Related Documents or any unrelated transaction (including any
             underlying transaction between any Credit Party and the beneficiary
             named in any such Letter of Credit);

                  (D) any statement or any other document presented under a
             Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
             insufficient in any respect, any statement therein being untrue or
             inaccurate in any respect, any errors, omissions, interruptions or
             delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail,
             telecopier or otherwise, or any errors in translation or in
             interpretation of technical terms;

                  (E) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
             against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
             strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or any
             defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of
             Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit (provided
             that any draft, certificate or other document presented pursuant to
             such Letter of Credit appears on its face to comply with the terms
             thereof), any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary
             or any transferee of the proceeds of such drawing or any other act
             or omission of such beneficiary or transferee in connection with
             such Letter of Credit;

                  (F) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral,
             or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure
             from the Security Documents, for all or any of the obligations of
             any Account Party or any other Person in respect of the L/C Related
             Documents;

                  (G) the occurrence of any Substitution Event, Suspension
             Event, Default or Event of Default; or

                                       26
<PAGE>

                  (H) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
             not similar to any of the foregoing, including without limitation
             any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense
             available to, or a discharge of, any Account Party or a guarantor.

         (b) Rescission. If any amount received by the Issuing Bank on account
of any Letter of Credit Advance, Reimbursement Obligation or other Obligation
shall be avoided, rescinded or otherwise returned or paid over by the Issuing
Bank for any reason at any time, whether before or after the termination of this
Agreement (or the Issuing Bank believes in good faith that such avoidance,
rescission, return or payment is required, whether or not such matter has been
adjudicated), each Lender will (except to the extent a corresponding amount
received by such Lender on account of its Letter of Credit Advance relating to
the same payment on a Letter of Credit has been avoided, rescinded or otherwise
returned or paid over by such Lender), promptly upon notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, pay over to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share of such amount, together
with its Pro Rata Share of any interest or penalties payable with respect
thereto.

         Section 2.04 Termination or Reduction of the L/C Commitments. RenRe
may, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent,
terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portion of the L/C Commitments;
provided, however, that each partial reduction (i) shall be in an aggregate
amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,
(ii) shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their L/C
Commitments and (iii) shall automatically reduce the Total Commitment, as
contemplated by the definition of that term.

         Section 2.05 Fees.

         (a) Commitment Fee. The Account Parties and RenRe jointly and severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a
commitment fee, from the Effective Date until the Expiration Date, payable in

December commencing March 31, 2003 and on the Expiration Date, at a rate equal
to 0.08% per annum on the average daily Unused L/C Commitment of such Lender
during such quarter (or shorter period); provided, however, that no commitment
fee shall accrue on the L/C Commitment of a Defaulting Lender so long as such
Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender.

         (b) Administrative Agent's and Collateral Agent's Fees. The Account
Parties and RenRe jointly and severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent for their own accounts such fees as are set forth in
the Fee Letter and as may from time to time be agreed between RenRe and the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, respectively.

         (c) Letter of Credit Fees, Etc.

             (i) Each Account Party severally agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commission,
         payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March,
         June, September and December commencing March 31, 2003, and on the
         Expiration Date, on such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the average daily

                                       27
<PAGE>

         aggregate Available Amount during such quarter (or shorter period) of
         all Letters of Credit for the account of such Account Party outstanding
         from time to time at a rate equal to 0.30% per annum.

             (ii) Each Account Party severally agrees to pay to the Issuing
         Bank, for its own account, a facing fee, payable in arrears quarterly
         on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
         commencing March 31, 2003, and on the Expiration Date, on the average
         daily aggregate of the Available Amount, less the Pro Rata Share of the
         Issuing Bank in its capacity as a Lender, during such quarter (or
         shorter period) of all Letters of Credit for the account of such
         Account Party outstanding from time to time at a rate equal to 0.03%
         per annum.

             (iii) Each Account Party severally agrees to pay to the Issuing
         Bank, for its own account, the Issuing Bank's customary issuance,
         presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard
         costs and charges, relating to letters of credit as are from time to
         time in effect.

         Section 2.06 Increased Costs, Etc.

         (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of, in each case after the date hereof, any law or regulation
or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued after the date
hereof from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender
of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of
Credit or the making of Letter of Credit Advances (excluding, for purposes of
this SECTION 2.06, any such increased costs resulting from (x) Taxes or Other
Taxes (as to which SECTION 2.08 shall govern) and (y) changes in the basis of
taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or
by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is
organized or has its Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then
the Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay, from time to time,
within five days after demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), which demand shall include a statement of the basis for
such demand and a calculation in reasonable detail of the amount demanded, to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as
to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to RenRe by such Lender, shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof,
or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued after the date
hereof from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender as a result of or based upon the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of such type, then,
within five days after demand by such Lender or such corporation (with a copy of
such demand to the Administrative Agent), which demand shall include a statement
of the basis for such demand and a calculation in reasonable detail of the
amount demanded, the Account Parties jointly and severally agree to pay to the
Administrative

                                       28
<PAGE>

Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such
Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of
such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment
to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or
maintenance of or participation in any Letters of Credit. A certificate as to
such amounts submitted to RenRe by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (c) Each Lender shall promptly notify RenRe and the Administrative
Agent of any event of which it has actual knowledge which will result in, and
will use reasonable commercial efforts available to it (and not, in such
Lender's good faith judgment, otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender) to
mitigate or avoid any obligation by the Account Parties to pay any amount
pursuant to SECTION 2.06(a) or (b) above or pursuant to SECTION 2.08(a) (and, if
any Lender has given notice of any such event and thereafter such event ceases
to exist, such Lender shall promptly so notify RenRe and the Administrative
Agent). Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender will designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid (or reduce the cost to the Account
Parties of) any event described in the preceding sentence and such designation
will not, in such Lender's good faith judgment, be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender.

         (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 2.06(a) or (b) or SECTION
2.08 (and without limiting subsection (c) above), no Lender shall be entitled to
compensation from the Account Parties for any amount arising prior to the date
which is 90 days before the date on which such Lender notifies RenRe of such
event or circumstance. As used in this SECTION 2.06 the term "Lender" includes
the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.

         Section 2.07 Payments and Computations.

         (a) The Account Parties (and RenRe, as applicable) shall make each
payment hereunder irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not
later than 11:00 A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the day when due, in
U.S. dollars, to the Administrative Agent in same day funds, with payments being
received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will
promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by
such Account Party is in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any
other amount then payable hereunder to more than one Lender, to such Lenders for
the account of their respective Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the
amounts of such respective amount then payable to such Lenders and (ii) if such
payment by such Account Party is in respect of any amount then payable hereunder
to one Lender, to such Lender for the account of its Lending Office, in each
case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to SECTION 9.05(d), from and after
the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent
shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to
the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and
Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods
prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

                                       29
<PAGE>

         (b) All computations of interest on Letter of Credit Advances (and any
other amount payable by reference to the Base Rate) when the Base Rate is
determined by reference to Wachovia's prime rate shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or, if applicable, 366 days;
all other computations of interest, fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall
be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days. All such
computations shall be made for the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest,
fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         (c) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be.

         Section 2.08 Taxes.

         (a) Any and all payments by any Credit Party hereunder or under any
other Credit Document shall be made, in accordance with SECTION 2.07, free and
clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and each Agent, taxes that are
imposed on its overall net income by the United States and taxes that are
imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof)
by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or such
Agent, as the case may be, is organized or any political subdivision thereof
and, in the case of each Lender, taxes that are imposed on its overall net
income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or foreign
jurisdiction of such Lender's Lending Office or any political subdivision
thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments hereunder being herein
referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall be required by law to deduct
any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or to any Lender or
any Agent, (i) the sum payable by such Credit Party shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after such Credit Party and the Administrative Agent have made
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this SECTION 2.08) such Lender or such Agent, as the case may be,
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make all such deductions and
(iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (b) In addition, each Credit Party shall pay any present or future
stamp, documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies that
arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
or any other Credit Document (herein referred to as "Other Taxes").

         (c) Each Credit Party shall indemnify each Lender and each Agent for
and hold them harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for
the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this SECTION 2.08, imposed on or paid by such Lender or such Agent
(as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties,

                                       30
<PAGE>

additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto. This indemnification payment shall be made within 10 days from the date
such Lender or such Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

         (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each Credit
Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in
SECTION 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such
payment.

         (e) If any Lender is incorporated or organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any state thereof (a
"Non-U.S. Lender") and is entitled to an exemption from or a reduction of United
States withholding tax pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, such Non-U.S.
Lender will deliver to each of the Administrative Agent and RenRe, on or prior
to the Effective Date (or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that becomes a party
to this Agreement as a result of an assignment after the Effective Date, on the
effective date of such assignment), (i) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is
a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a
properly completed Internal Revenue Service Form 4224, 1001, W-8BEN, W-8ECI or
W-8EXP, as applicable (or successor forms), certifying that such Non-U.S. Lender
is entitled to an exemption from or a reduction of withholding or deduction for
or on account of United States federal income taxes in connection with payments
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, together with a properly
completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable (or successor
forms), and (ii) in the case of a Non-U. S. Lender that is not a "bank" for
purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a certificate in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and RenRe
and to the effect that (x) such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" for purposes of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not subject to regulatory
or other legal requirements as a bank in any jurisdiction, and has not been
treated as a bank for purposes of any tax, securities law or other filing or
submission made to any governmental authority, any application made to a rating
agency or qualification for any exemption from any tax, securities law or other
legal requirements, (y) is not a 10-percent shareholder for purposes of Section
881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and (z) is not a controlled foreign
corporation receiving interest from a related person for purposes of Section
881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, together with a properly completed
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as applicable (or successor forms).
Each such Non-U.S. Lender further agrees to deliver to each of the
Administrative Agent and RenRe an additional copy of each such relevant form on
or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event (including a change in its Lending Office) requiring a
change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, in each case certifying that
such Non-U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from or a reduction of
withholding or deduction for or on account of United States federal income taxes
in connection with payments under this Agreement, unless an event (including
without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior
to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required, which event
renders all such forms inapplicable or the exemption to which such forms relate
unavailable and such Non-U.S. Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and RenRe
that it is not entitled to receive payments without deduction or withholding of
United States federal income taxes. Each such Non-U.S. Lender will promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and RenRe of any changes in circumstances that
would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

         (f) The Credit Parties shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S.
Lender, or to pay any additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of
United States federal withholding tax to the extent that (i) the obligation to
withhold amounts with respect to United States federal withholding tax existed
on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement; provided,
however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to the extent that (y) the
indemnity payments or additional amounts any Lender would be entitled to receive
(without regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or
additional amounts that the person making the assignment, participation or
transfer to such Lender would have been entitled to receive in the absence of
such assignment, participation or transfer, or (z) such assignment,
participation or transfer was requested by RenRe, (ii) the obligation to pay
such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Non-U.S.
Lender to comply with the provisions of SECTION 2.08(e) or (iii) any of the
representations or certifications made by a Non-U.S. Lender pursuant to SECTION
2.08(e) are incorrect at the time a payment hereunder is made, other than by
reason of any change in treaty, law or regulation having effect after the date
such representations or certifications were made.

         (g) At RenRe's request and at the Credit Parties' cost, each Lender
shall take reasonable steps (i) to contest such Lender's liability for Taxes
that have not been paid or (ii) to seek a refund of Taxes. Nothing in this
SECTION 2.08 shall obligate any Lender to disclose any information regarding its
tax affairs or computations to any Credit Party.

         (h) For any period with respect to which a Lender which may lawfully do
so has failed to provide RenRe with the appropriate form described in SECTION
2.08(e) above (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring
after the date on which a form originally was required to be provided or if such
form otherwise is not required under such section), such Lender shall not be
entitled to indemnification under SECTION 2.08(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes
imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that
should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
required hereunder, RenRe shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably
request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

         Section 2.09 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain at
any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment
pursuant to SECTION 9.05(a)) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to
such Lender hereunder at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such
Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and
payable to all Lenders hereunder at such time) of payments on account of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder at such time obtained by
all the Lenders at such time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due
and payable) to such Lender hereunder at such time in excess of its ratable
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing
to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder at such time) of
payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lenders hereunder at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, such
Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such interests or
participating interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as
the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share
the excess payment ratably with

                                       32
<PAGE>

each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from
each other Lender shall be rescinded and such other Lender shall repay to the
purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such Lender's ratable
share (according to the proportion of (A) the purchase price paid to such Lender
to (B) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lenders) of such recovery
together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the
proportion of (x) the amount of such other Lender's required repayment to (y)
the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or
other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total
amount so recovered. Each Credit Party agrees that any Lender so purchasing an
interest or participating interest from another Lender pursuant to this SECTION
2.09 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or
participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such interest or
participating interest, as the case may be.

         Section 2.10 Use of Letters of Credit. The Letters of Credit shall be
used to support obligations under the Account Parties' insurance and reinsurance
liabilities.

         Section 2.11 Defaulting Lenders.

         (a) In the event that, at any time, (i) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount to
any Agent or any of the other Lenders and (iii) any Credit Party shall make any
payment hereunder or under any other Credit Document to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, on
its behalf or on behalf of such other Lenders and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, apply at such time the amount so paid by such
Credit Party to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender to the payment of
each such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to pay such Defaulted Amount.
In the event that the Administrative Agent shall so apply any such amount to the
payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied by the
Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents payment, to such extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such
date. Any such amount so applied by the Administrative Agent shall be retained
by the Administrative Agent or distributed by the Administrative Agent to such
other Lenders, ratably in accordance with the respective portions of such
Defaulted Amounts payable at such time to the Administrative Agent and such
other Lenders and, if the amount of such payment made by such Credit Party shall
at such time be insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to
the Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lenders, in the
following order of priority:

                 first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then owing to
                 the Agents in their capacities as such;

                 second, to the Issuing Bank for any amount then due and payable
                 to it, in its capacity as such, by such Defaulting Lender,
                 ratably in accordance with such amounts then due and payable to
                 the Issuing Bank; and

                                       33
<PAGE>

                 third, to any other Lenders for any Defaulted Amounts then
                 owing to such other Lenders, ratably in accordance with such
                 respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lenders.

Any portion of such amount paid by such Credit Party for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) of this SECTION 2.11.

         (b) In the event that, at any time, (i) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not then owe a Defaulted
Amount and (iii) any Credit Party, any Agent or other Lender shall be required
to pay or distribute any amount hereunder or under any other Credit Document to
or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then such Credit Party or such
Agent or such other Lender shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent to
be held by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, in escrow and the Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by
it. Any funds held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection
(b) shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent in an account with Wachovia
in the name and under the control of the Administrative Agent, but subject to
the provisions of this subsection (b). The terms applicable to such account,
including the rate of interest payable with respect to the credit balance of
such account from time to time, shall be Wachovia's standard terms applicable to
escrow accounts maintained with it. Any interest credited to such account from
time to time shall be held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under, and
applied by the Administrative Agent from time to time in accordance with the
provisions of, this subsection (b). The Administrative Agent shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so held in escrow
from time to time to the extent necessary to make any Letter of Credit Advances
required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and to pay any amount payable by
such Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Credit Documents to the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, as and when such Letter of Credit
Advances or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the amount so held
in escrow shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all such Letter of
Credit Advances and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, in the
following order of priority:

                 first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable by
                 such Defaulting Lender to the Agents in their capacities as
                 such;

                 second, to the Issuing Bank for any amount then due and payable
                 to it, in its capacity as such, by such Defaulting Lender,
                 ratably in accordance with such amounts then due and payable to
                 such Issuing Bank; and

                 third, to any other Lenders for any amount then due and payable
                 by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lenders hereunder,
                 ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and
                 payable to such other Lenders.

                                       34
<PAGE>

In the event that any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender shall cease to be a
Defaulting Lender and all amounts owing by such Lender to the Agents and the
other Lenders shall have been paid in full, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender shall be distributed by
the Administrative Agent to such Lender and applied by such Lender to the
Obligations owing to such Lender at such time under this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents ratably in accordance with the respective amounts of such
Obligations outstanding at such time.

         (c) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this
SECTION 2.11 are in addition to other rights and remedies that any Agent or any
Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted
Amount.

         Section 2.12 Replacement of Affected Lender. At any time any Lender is
an Affected Lender, the RenRe may replace such Affected Lender as a party to
this Agreement with one or more other Lenders and/or Eligible Assignees, and
upon notice from RenRe such Affected Lender shall assign pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance, and without recourse or warranty (other than as to
the absence of Liens arising by, through or under such Affected Lender), its L/C
Commitment, its Letter of Credit Advances, its obligations to fund Letter of
Credit payments, its participation in, and its rights and obligations with
respect to, Letters of Credit, and all of its other rights and obligations
hereunder to such other Lenders and/or Eligible Assignees for a purchase price
equal to the sum of the principal amount of the Letter of Credit Advances so
assigned, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, such Affected Lender's
ratable share of all accrued and unpaid fees payable pursuant to SECTION 2.05
and all other Obligations owed to such Affected Lender hereunder.

         Section 2.13 Certain Provisions Relating to the Issuing Bank and
Letters of Credit.

         (a) Letter of Credit Agreements. The representations, warranties and
covenants by the Account Parties under, and the rights and remedies of the
Issuing Bank under, any Letter of Credit Agreement relating to any Letter of
Credit are in addition to, and not in limitation or derogation of,
representations, warranties and covenants by the Credit Parties under, and
rights and remedies of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders under, this Agreement
and applicable law. Each Account Party acknowledges and agrees that all rights
of the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of each Lender to the extent of its Letter of Credit Participating
Interest Commitment and Letter of Credit Advances as fully as if such Lender was
a party to such Letter of Credit Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and any Letter of Credit Agreement, this
Agreement shall prevail.

         (b) Certain Provisions. The Issuing Bank shall have no duties or
responsibilities to any Agent or any Lender except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement, and no implied duties or responsibilities on the part of the
Issuing Bank shall be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist. The
duties and responsibilities of the Issuing Bank to the Lenders and the Agents
under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature, and the Issuing Bank shall not have a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Agent, any Lender or any other Person. The
Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it under or in connection with this Agreement or any Credit Document or Letter
of Credit, except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful

                                       35
<PAGE>

misconduct of the Issuing Bank, as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to ascertain,
inquire or give any notice to any Agent or any Lender relating to (i) the
performance or observance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or
any other Credit Document on the part of any Credit Party, (ii) the business,
operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Credit
Parties or any other Person, or (iii) the existence of any Suspension Event,
Default or Event of Default. Each Credit Party assumes all risks of the acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect
to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Issuing Bank nor any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for: (w)
the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (x) the validity, sufficiency
or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such
documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
fraudulent or forged; (y) payment by the Issuing Bank against presentation of
documents that do not strictly comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit,
including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference
to the Letter of Credit; or (z) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or
failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Applicable
Account Party shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank
shall be liable to such Account Party, to the extent of any direct, but not
consequential, damages suffered by such Account Party that such Account Party
proves were caused by (a) the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross
negligence as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction in determining whether documents presented under any
Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (b) the
Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit
after the presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with
the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear
on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation,
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary. It is expressly
understood and agreed that, for purposes of determining whether a wrongful
payment under a Letter of Credit resulted from the Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, (1) the Issuing Bank's acceptance of documents
that appear on their face to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit,
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, (2) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the
documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters
set forth therein, including the amount of any draft presented under such Letter
of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals
the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to
such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect (so long as such
document appears on its face to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit),
and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant
to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein
proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever, and (3) any
noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such
Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. The
Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to provide any Agent or any Lender with any notices, reports
or information of any nature, whether in its possession presently or hereafter,
except for such notices, reports and other information expressly required by
this Agreement to be so furnished. The Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for
the execution,

                                       36
<PAGE>

delivery, effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity or adequacy of
this Agreement or any Credit Document.

         (c) Administration. The Issuing Bank may rely upon any notice or other
communication of any nature (written, electronic or oral, including but not
limited to telephone conversations and transmissions through the Issuing Bank's
remote access system, whether or not such notice or other communication is made
in a manner permitted or required by this Agreement or any other Credit
Document) purportedly made by or on behalf of the proper party or parties, and
the Issuing Bank shall not have any duty to verify the identity or authority of
any Person giving such notice or other communication. The Issuing Bank may
consult with legal counsel (including without limitation in-house counsel for
the Issuing Bank or in-house or other counsel for the Credit Parties),
independent public accountants and any other experts selected by it from time to
time, and the Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts. Whenever the Issuing Bank shall deem it necessary or
desirable that a matter be proved or established with respect to any Credit
Party, any Agent or any Lender, such matter may be established by a certificate
of such Credit Party, such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and the
Issuing Bank may conclusively rely upon such certificate. The Issuing Bank shall
not be deemed to have any knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any
Suspension Event, Default or Event of Default unless the Issuing Bank has
received notice from a Lender, an Agent or a Credit Party referring to this
Agreement, describing such Suspension Event, Default, or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of Default" or "notice of Suspension
Event".

         (d) Indemnification of Issuing Bank by Lenders. Each Lender hereby
agrees to reimburse and indemnify the Issuing Bank and each of its directors,
officers, employees and agents (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit
Parties and without limitation of the obligations of the Credit Parties to do
so), in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, from and against any and all
amounts, losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature
(including without limitation the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
for the Issuing Bank or such other Person in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not
the Issuing Bank or such other Person shall be designated a party thereto) that
may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Issuing Bank,
in its capacity as such, or such other Person, as a result of, or arising out
of, or in any way related to or by reason of, this Agreement, any other Credit
Document or any Letter of Credit, any transaction from time to time contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any transaction financed in whole or in part or directly
or indirectly with the proceeds of any Letter of Credit, provided, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such amounts, losses, liabilities,
claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs or disbursements to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank or such other indemnified Person, as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

         (e) Issuing Bank in its Individual Capacity. With respect to its
commitments and the obligations owing to it, the Issuing Bank shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement and each other Credit Document as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Issuing
Bank, and the term "Lenders" and like terms shall include the Issuing Bank in
its individual capacity as such. The Issuing Bank and its affiliates may,
without

                                       37
<PAGE>

liability to account to any Person, make loans to, accept deposits from, acquire
debt or equity interests in, act as trustee under indentures of, act as agent
under other credit facilities for, and engage in any other business with, any
Credit Party and any stockholder, subsidiary or affiliate of any Credit Party,
as though the Issuing Bank were not the Issuing Bank hereunder.

         Section 2.14 Downgrade Event with Respect to a Lender.

         (a) If a Downgrade Event shall occur with respect to any Lender, then
the Issuing Bank may, by notice to such Downgraded Lender, the Administrative
Agent and RenRe within 45 days after such Downgrade Event (any such notice, a
"Downgrade Notice"), request that RenRe use reasonable efforts to replace such
Lender as a party to this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 2.12. If such Lender is
not so replaced within 45 days after receipt by RenRe of such Downgrade Notice,
then such Downgraded Lender shall be obligated to provide (in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank) cash collateral to the Issuing Bank
for (or if such Downgraded Lender is unable, without regulatory approval, to
provide cash collateral, a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuing Bank) covering its contingent obligations to reimburse the Issuing Bank
for any payment under any Letter of Credit as provided in SECTION 2.02(e) (its
"L/C Participation Obligations"), in which event such Downgraded Lender
thereupon shall (and each Lender agrees that in such circumstances it will)
deliver to the Issuing Bank (I) immediately, cash collateral (or, as aforesaid,
a letter of credit) in an amount equal to its L/C Participation Obligations and
(II) from time to time thereafter (so long as it is a Downgraded Lender), cash
collateral (or, as aforesaid, a letter of credit) sufficient to cover any
increase in its L/C Participation Obligations as a result of any proposed
issuance of or increase in a Letter of Credit. Any funds provided by a
Downgraded Lender for such purpose shall be maintained in a segregated deposit
account in the name of the Issuing Bank at the Issuing Bank's principal office
in the United States (a "Downgrade Account"). The funds so deposited in any
Downgrade Account (or any drawing under such a letter of credit) shall be used
only in accordance with the following provisions of this SECTION 2.14.

         (b) If such Downgraded Lender has failed to comply with its obligations
under clause (a) of this SECTION 2.14, then:

             (i) the Total Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of the L/C
         Commitment of such Downgraded Lender in respect of which its
         obligations are not satisfied,

             (ii) the Account Parties shall prepay all amounts owed to such
         Downgraded Lender hereunder or in connection herewith, and

             (iii) if, upon the reduction of the Total Commitment under clause
         (i) above and the payment under clause (ii) above, the sum of the
         principal amount of all Letter of Credit Advances plus the Available
         Amount of all Letters of Credit would exceed the Total Commitment by an
         amount in excess of the cash collateral (or the stated amount of any
         letter of credit) posted by such Downgraded Lender, then the Account
         Parties will immediately either (x) eliminate such excess by causing
         the Available Amount of one or more Letters of Credit to be reduced, or
         (y) deposit the amount of such excess into a Cash Collateral Account
         with the Issuing Bank.

                                       38
<PAGE>

         (c) If any Downgraded Lender shall be required to fund its
participation in a payment under a Letter of Credit pursuant to SECTION 2.02(e),
then the Issuing Bank shall apply the funds deposited in the applicable
Downgrade Account by such Downgraded Lender (or any drawing under such a letter
of credit) to fund such participation. The deposit of funds in a Downgrade
Account by any Downgraded Lender (or any drawing under such a letter of credit)
shall not constitute a Letter of Credit Advance (and the Downgraded Lender shall
not be entitled to interest on such funds except as provided in SECTION 2.14(d)
unless and until (and then only to the extent that) such funds (or any drawing
under such a letter of credit) are used by the Issuing Bank to fund the
participation of such Downgraded Lender pursuant to the first sentence of this
SECTION 2.14(c).

         (d) Funds in a Downgrade Account shall be invested in such investments
as may be agreed between the Issuing Bank and the applicable Downgraded Lender,
and the income from such investments shall be distributed to such Downgraded
Lender from time to time (but not less often than monthly) as agreed between the
Issuing Bank and such Downgraded Lender. The Issuing Bank will (i) from time to
time, upon request by a Downgraded Lender, release to such Downgraded Lender any
amount on deposit in the applicable Downgrade Account in excess of the L/C
Participation Obligations of such Downgraded Lender (or, if applicable, not draw
under any such letter of credit in excess of the L/C Participation Obligations
of such Downgraded Lender) and (ii) upon the earliest to occur of (A) the
effective date of any replacement of such Downgraded Lender as a party hereto
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, (B) the termination of such Downgraded
Lender's L/C Commitment pursuant to clause (a) or (C) the first Business Day
after receipt by the Issuing Bank of evidence (reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuing Bank) that such Lender is no longer a Downgraded Lender, release to such
Lender all amounts on deposit in the applicable Downgrade Account (or, if
applicable, return such letter of credit to such Lender for cancellation).

         (e) At any time any Downgraded Lender is required to maintain cash
collateral with the Issuing Bank pursuant to this SECTION 2.14, the Issuing Bank
shall have no obligation to issue or increase any Letter of Credit unless such
Downgraded Lender has provided sufficient funds as cash collateral to the
Issuing Bank to cover all L/C Participation Obligations of such Downgraded
Lender (including in respect of the Letter of Credit to be issued or increased).

         Section 2.15 Downgrade Event or Other Event with Respect to the Issuing
Bank. At any time the Issuing Bank is a Downgraded Lender or at such other times
as the Issuing Bank and RenRe may agree, RenRe may, upon not less than three
Business Days' notice to the Issuing Bank (in this Section sometimes referred to
as the "Old Issuing Bank") and the Administrative Agent, designate any Lender
(so long as such Lender has agreed to such designation) as an additional Issuing
Bank hereunder (in this Section sometimes referred to as the "New Issuing
Bank"). Such notice shall specify the date (which shall be a Business Day) on
which the New Issuing Bank is to become an additional Issuing Bank hereunder.
From and after such date, all new Letters of Credit requested to be issued
hereunder shall be issued by the New Issuing Bank. From and after such date (and
until the first date on which no Letters of Credit issued by the Old Issuing
Bank are outstanding and no reimbursement obligations are owed to the Old
Issuing Bank, on which date the Old Issuing Bank shall cease to be an Issuing
Bank hereunder), references in this Agreement to the Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to refer (a) to the Old Issuing Bank, with respect to Letters of Credit
issued by it, (b) to the New Issuing Bank, with respect to

                                       39
<PAGE>

Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by it, and (c) to each of the Old
Issuing Bank and the New Issuing Bank, with respect to other matters.
Notwithstanding the fact that an Old Issuing Bank shall cease to be an Issuing
Bank hereunder, all of the exculpatory, indemnification and similar provisions
hereof in favor of the Issuing Bank shall inure to such Old Issuing Bank's
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted by it while it was an Issuing Bank
under this Agreement. The Account Parties and RenRe agree that after any
appointment of a New Issuing Bank hereunder, the Account Parties and RenRe shall
use reasonable commercial efforts to promptly replace (or otherwise cause the
applicable beneficiary to return to the Old Issuing Bank for cancellation) each
letter of credit issued by the Old Issuing Bank with a Letter of Credit issued
by the New Issuing Bank.

         Section 2.16 Collateral.

         (a) It is a condition of the issuance and maintenance of Letters of
Credit hereunder that the Letter of Credit Outstandings be at all times fully
secured by Collateral consisting of cash, eligible marketable securities or, so
long as eligible, Redeemable Preference Shares. Pursuant to the Security
Documents and as collateral security for the payment and performance of the
Obligations, the Account Parties shall grant and convey, or cause to be granted
and conveyed, to the Collateral Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the
Lenders, a Lien and security interest in, to and upon the Collateral, prior and
superior to all other Liens other than Permitted Liens. Each Account Party shall
cause the Collateral to be charged or pledged and be made subject to the
Security Documents (in form and substance acceptable to the Collateral Agent)
necessary for the perfection of the Lien and security interest in, to and upon
the Collateral and for the exercise by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders of their rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder. In
addition, RIHL has agreed to guarantee certain of the Obligations under certain
circumstances as provided in the RIHL Agreement (the "RIHL Guaranty"), and has
agreed to secure the RIHL Guaranty pursuant to the RIHL Pledge and RIHL Control
Agreement.

         (b) (i) On the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed date of
issuance or renewal of a Letter of Credit under SECTION 2.02(a), (ii) within ten
(10) Business Days after the end of each calendar month, and (iii) at and as of
such other times as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may
reasonably request in its (or their) sole discretion, RenRe shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate in the form of
EXHIBIT H or otherwise in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, setting forth with respect to each Applicable Account Party and RIHL the
information provided for in such form and such other information as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request (such certificate, a "Collateral
Value Report"). Such certificate shall be subject to review and verification by
the Administrative Agent, it being understood and agreed that the Administrative
Agent shall have the right to redetermine the Collateral Value of the Collateral
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Security
Documents.

         (c) At any time from and after the occurrence of any Substitution
Event, Suspension Event, Default or Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall
have the right to redeem (through the Custodian or by exercising the proxy of
the Custodian) the Redeemable Preference Shares held in the applicable Custodial
Accounts for cash within three Business Days or, at the election of the
Collateral Agent, for marketable securities acceptable to the Collateral Agent
within one

                                       40
<PAGE>

Business Day; provided, that if the relevant event is exclusively a Substitution
Event, RIHL may elect to make such redemption in cash or in kind within the
foregoing time periods. Such redemptions shall be made pursuant to the terms of
the Security Documents and the RIHL Bye-laws.

         (d) The Account Parties may from time to time add or substitute
eligible Collateral to or sell, deliver, transfer or otherwise withdraw
Collateral from any Custodial Account (including without limitation by trading
of securities), as and to the extent permitted by the Security Documents.

         Section 2.17 Cash Collateral Accounts. At any time and from time to
time (i) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
with respect to any Account Party, the Administrative Agent, at the direction or
with the consent of the Required Lenders, may require such Account Party to
deliver to the Collateral Agent such additional amount of cash as is equal to
the aggregate Letter of Credit Exposure for such Account Party at any time
outstanding (whether or not any beneficiary under any Letter of Credit shall
have drawn or be entitled at such time to draw thereunder) and (ii) that an
Account Party elects to make a payment into a Cash Collateral Account as
provided in SECTION 2.14, such amounts under clause (i) above to be held by the
Collateral Agent and under clause (ii) above to be held by the Issuing Bank, in
a cash collateral account (each being a "Cash Collateral Account"). Each Account
Party hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing
Bank, the Agents and the Lenders, and to the Issuing Bank for its own benefit, a
Lien upon and security interest in its Cash Collateral Account and all amounts
held therein from time to time as security for such Account Party's Obligations,
and for application to such Account Party's Obligations as and when the same
shall arise. The Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank shall have exclusive dominion
and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such accounts
held by them. Other than any interest on the investment of such amounts in cash
equivalent investments, which investments shall be made at the direction of the
Account Party (unless a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, in which case the determination as to investments shall be made at
the option and in the discretion of the Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank, as
applicable), amounts in the Cash Collateral Account shall not bear interest.
Interest and profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such
account. In the event of a drawing, and subsequent payment by the Issuing Bank,
under any Letter of Credit at any time during which any amounts are held in the
Applicable Account Party's Cash Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent will
deliver to the Issuing Bank or the Issuing Bank will withdraw an amount equal to
the reimbursement obligation created as a result of such payment (or, if the
amounts so held are less than such reimbursement obligation, all of such
amounts) to reimburse the Issuing Bank therefor. Any amounts remaining in an
Account Party's Cash Collateral Account after the expiration of all Letters of
Credit of such Account Party and reimbursement in full of the Issuing Bank for
all of such Account Party's Obligations thereunder shall be held by the
Collateral Agent or Issuing Bank, for the benefit of the applicable Account
Party, to be applied against the Obligations of such Account Party in such order
and manner as the Administrative Agent may direct. If the Account Parties
provide cash collateral pursuant to SECTION 2.14(b)(iii), such amount (to the
extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Account Parties on
demand, provided that after giving effect to such return (i) the conditions that
required such cash collateral shall no longer be continuing and (ii) no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time. If an
Account Party is required to provide cash collateral as a result of

                                       41
<PAGE>

an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
be returned to the Account Party within three Business Days after all Events of
Default have been cured or waived.

         Section 2.18 Increase of Total Commitment. Upon (a) the execution of a
signature page to this Agreement by a new bank or financial institution (a "New
Lender") and acceptance thereof by the Administrative Agent and RenRe, and (b)
delivery of notice to the other Lenders by the Administrative Agent setting
forth the effective date of the addition of the New Lender hereunder and the
amount of such New Lender's L/C Commitment, such New Lender shall, without the
necessity of any further action by any other Lender or Agent, be for all
purposes a Lender party to this Agreement with an L/C Commitment as set forth on
the signature page executed by the New Lender; provided, however, (i) the Total
Commitment shall not exceed in the aggregate $500,000,000, (ii) the Total
Commitment may not be increased at any time a Suspension Event, Default or Event
of Default exists or the Lenders have unreimbursed Letter of Credit Advances
pursuant to SECTION 2.02(e), and (iii) the L/C Commitments and obligations of
all Lenders party hereto prior to the addition of any New Lender shall not be
affected by the addition of such New Lender, other than the resulting adjustment
to the pro rata share which each Lender has of the aggregate Letter of Credit
Participating Interests, it being intended that the New Lender's L/C Commitment
and Letter of Credit Participating Interests shall be pari passu with those of
the other Lenders. An existing Lender may also increase its L/C Commitment on
the same terms as a New Lender.

         Section 2.19 Extension of Expiration Date. RenRe may, at its option,
give the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank written notice (an "Extension
Request") at any time not more than sixty days, nor less than thirty days, prior
to the Expiration Date in effect at such time (the "Current Expiration Date") of
the Credit Parties' desire to extend the Expiration Date to a date which is not
later than 364 days after the Current Expiration Date. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of such Extension Request, and each Lender
shall endeavor to respond to such Extension Request, whether affirmatively or
negatively (such determination to be in the sole discretion of such Lender and
may be separately denied for any Account Party), by notice to RenRe and the
Administrative Agent within 10 days of receipt of such request. A Lender that
has not affirmatively responded within such 10-day period shall be deemed to
have responded negatively. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify RenRe
of Lenders' responses (or deemed responses) and the aggregate amount (the
"Rejected Amount") of the L/C Commitments of the Lenders (the "Rejecting
Lenders") that have not agreed to the Extension Request. If the Rejected Amount
exceeds 50% of the Total Commitment (or if Wachovia shall be a Rejecting
Lender), the Current Expiration Date shall not be extended. If the Rejected
Amount does not exceed 50% of the Total Commitment, RenRe shall have the right,
in consultation with and through the Administrative Agent, prior to the Current
Expiration Date, as the case may be, to request one or more Lenders that have
agreed to the requested extension (the "Accepting Lenders") to increase their
L/C Commitments by an aggregate amount not to exceed the Rejected Amount. Each
Accepting Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to
increase its L/C Commitment by an amount not to exceed the amount requested by
RenRe, which offer shall be made by notice from such Accepting Lender to the
Administrative Agent, not later than 10 days after such Accepting Lender is
notified of such request by the Administrative Agent, specifying the amount of
the offered increase in such Accepting Lender's L/C Commitment. Such increase
shall be effected on the Current Expiration Date by a pro rata assignment of a
Rejecting Lender's or Rejecting Lenders' Letter of Credit Advances and L/C

                                       42
<PAGE>

Commitment pursuant to SECTION 9.05 (without regard to the minimum assignment
amount set forth therein), which each Rejecting Lender agrees to make. If the
aggregate amount of the offered increases in the L/C Commitments of all
Accepting Lenders does not equal the Rejected Amount, RenRe shall have the
right, prior to the Current Expiration Date, to require the Rejecting Lender or
Rejecting Lenders to assign on a pro rata basis its or their Loans and L/C
Commitments to one or more Eligible Assignees (the "Purchasing Lenders")
pursuant to SECTION 9.05, each of which Purchasing Lenders shall have a L/C
Commitment not less than $5,000,000, and which Purchasing Lenders shall have
aggregate L/C Commitments not greater than the Rejected Amount less any
increases in the L/C Commitments of the Accepting Lenders. Such assignment shall
be effected on the Current Expiration Date. Each Purchasing Lender shall be
deemed to have consented to the extension of the Current Expiration Date. If
there remains any Rejected Amount after giving effect to the assignments to the
Accepting Lenders and the Purchasing Lenders described in this SECTION 2.19, on
or before the Current Expiration Date, RenRe may, by notice to the
Administrative Agent, elect to reduce the Total Commitment by such remaining
Rejected Amount, and, if RenRe so elects, on the Current Expiration Date, the
Account Parties shall cause all Obligations owing to the applicable Rejecting
Lender or Rejecting Lenders to be repaid, and upon such repayment, the Total
Commitment shall be reduced by the amount of such remaining Rejected Amount. If
the conditions to extension set forth above have been met, then, on the Current
Expiration Date, the Expiration Date shall be deemed to have been extended to,
and shall be, the date specified in such Extension Request. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly after any such extension advise the Lenders of any changes
in the Total Commitments and the Letter of Credit Participating Interest
Percentages. No such extension shall become effective unless, immediately upon
the proposed effectiveness thereof, the aggregate Letter of Credit Exposure
would be less than the Total Commitment.

         Section 2.20 Effectiveness. Notwithstanding any termination of the L/C
Commitments, the obligations of the Credit Parties under this Article shall
remain in full force and effect until the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall
have no further obligations to make any payments or disbursements under any
circumstances with respect to any Letter of Credit and the Termination Date
shall have occurred.

and documents required to be retained by it pursuant to any law, ordinance,
rule, regulation, order, policy, guideline or other requirement of any
Governmental Authority, if the failure to so retain such records and documents

Effect. No ERISA Event (i) has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) to the
knowledge of each Covered Credit Party, is reasonably expected to occur with
respect to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan.

compliance in all material respects with the Requirements of Law applicable to
such Foreign Government Scheme or Arrangement or Foreign Plan and (ii) each such
Foreign Government Scheme or Arrangement or Foreign Plan is being administered
by the applicable Covered Credit Party in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Requirements of Law, except where the failure to do so,

Material Adverse Effect. No event that could reasonably be considered the
substantive equivalent of an ERISA Event with respect to any Foreign Government
Scheme or Arrangement or Foreign Plan (i) has occurred and is continuing, or
(ii) to the knowledge of each Covered Credit Party, is reasonably expected to
occur.

License therein listed. The Material Insurance Companies do not transact any

kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Account Parties and (C)
the obligation of such Account Parties to provide cash collateral under SECTION
7.03(b) shall automatically become effective.

         (b) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with
respect to any or all of the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent may, or
shall at the request of the Required Lenders, after having taken any of the
actions described in SECTION 7.03(a) or otherwise, (i) make demand upon such
Account Parties to, and forthwith upon such demand such Account Parties will,
pay to the Administrative Agent all amounts to be placed in the Cash Collateral
Accounts pursuant to SECTION 2.17 and (ii) redeem the Redeemable Preference
Shares as described in SECTION 2.16(c).

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   THE AGENTS

Section 8.01 Authorization and Action. Each Lender (in its capacity as a Lender)
hereby appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Credit Documents,
no Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act (in the case of the Administrative Agent) or to refrain
from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from
acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders where
unanimity is required, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders;
provided, however, that no Agent shall be required to take any action that
exposes such Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement
or applicable law.

Section 8.02 Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither any Agent nor any of its respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Credit
Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each

                                       64
<PAGE>

Agent: (a) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Credit
Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (b)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection with the Credit Documents; (c) shall not have
any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any
of the terms, covenants or conditions of any Credit Document on the part of any
Credit Party or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any
Credit Party; (d) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, any Credit Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (e) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Credit Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram or
telecopy) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
proper party or parties.

         Section 8.03 Wachovia and Affiliates. With respect to its L/C
Commitments and the Letter of Credit Advances, Wachovia shall have the same
rights and powers under the Credit Documents as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not an Agent; and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wachovia in its
individual capacity. Wachovia and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Credit
Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that may do business with or own
securities of any Credit Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if Wachovia were
not an Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

         Section 8.04 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and
based on the financial statements referred to in SECTION 4.06(b) and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

         Section 8.05 Indemnification.

         (a) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify each Agent and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and Affiliates (to the extent
not promptly reimbursed by the Credit Parties) from and against such Lender's
ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against such Agent or any such other Person in any
way relating to or arising out of the Credit Documents or any action taken or
omitted by such Agent under the Credit Documents; provided, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from such Agent's or other Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the

                                       65
<PAGE>

foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse each Agent promptly upon demand for
its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including without limitation
Attorneys Costs) payable by the Credit Parties under SECTION 9.03, to the extent
that such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the
Credit Parties.

         (b) For purposes of this SECTION 8.05, the Lenders' respective ratable
shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time, according to the sum of
(i) the aggregate principal amount of the Letter of Credit Advances outstanding
at such time and owing to the respective Lenders, (ii) their respective Pro Rata
Shares of the aggregate Available Amounts of all Letters of Credit outstanding
at such time and (iii) their respective Unused L/C Commitments at such time. The
failure of any Lender to reimburse any Agent promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the Lenders to such Agent as
provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder
to reimburse such Agent for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse such Agent
for such other Lender's ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the
survival of any other agreement of any Lender hereunder, the agreement and
obligations of each Lender contained in this SECTION 8.05 shall survive the
payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder
and under the other Credit Documents.

         Section 8.06 Successor Administrative Agent. Any Agent may resign at
any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and RenRe and may be
removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, subject (so long as
no Event of Default exists) to the consent of RenRe (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative
Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
organized under the laws of the United States or of any State thereof and having
a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under the Credit Documents. If within 45 days
after written notice is given of the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
or removal under this SECTION 8.06 no successor Administrative Agent shall have
been appointed and shall have accepted such appointment, then on such 45th day
(i) the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal shall become
effective, (ii) the retiring Administrative Agent shall thereupon be discharged
from its duties and obligations under the Credit Documents and (iii) the
Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent under the Credit Documents until such time, if any, as the
Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.
After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent shall have
become effective, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under
this Agreement. If the Collateral Agent resigns or is removed at any time and no
successor Collateral Agent has been appointed and agreed to serve as such, the

                                       66
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent shall be the Collateral Agent. If any Co-Documentation
Agent ceases to be a Lender hereunder, it shall be deemed to have resigned as
Co-Documentation Agent and no replacement shall be appointed. If Lloyds TSB Bank
ceases to be a Lender hereunder, it shall be deemed to have resigned as managing
agent and no replacement shall be appointed.

         Section 8.07 Collateral Matters.

         (a) The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are authorized on
behalf of the Lenders, without the necessity of any further notice to or consent
from any of the Lenders, from time to time to take any action with respect to
any Collateral or Security Document that may be necessary or as it may deem to
be appropriate to perfect, maintain and protect the security interests in and
Liens on the Collateral granted pursuant to the Security Documents.

         (b) The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent (acting
directly or through the Collateral Agent) to release any security interest in or
Lien on the Collateral held by it pursuant to the Security Documents (i) upon
the termination of the Issuing Bank's obligation to issue Letters of Credit
hereunder, the payment in full of the Obligations and the satisfaction and
termination in full of all other Letter of Credit Outstandings, (ii) that is
sold or disposed of as permitted hereunder or any other Credit Document or to
which the requisite number or percentage of Lenders have consented or (iii)
otherwise pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of any applicable
Credit Document. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release
Collateral pursuant to this subsection (b).

         Section 8.08 Co-Documentation Agents, Managing Agent. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, the
Co-Documentation Agents and any managing agent are named as such for recognition
purposes only, and in their capacities as such shall have no powers, rights,
duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.01 Amendments, Etc. Except as expressly provided in SECTION
2.19 with respect to any extension of the Expiration Date, no amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, nor
consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Issuing Bank and
the Required Lenders (and, in the case of an amendment, RenRe), and then any
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders
(other than (A) any Lender that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender, and (B)
in the case of clauses (vi) and (vii) below, any Lender which is not and will
not be (and is not and will not be owed any obligation which is or will be)
affected thereby); do any of the following at any time: (i) waive any of the
conditions specified in SECTION 3.02 or, in the case of the Effective Date,
SECTION 3.01, (ii) change the percentage of (x)

                                       67
<PAGE>

the L/C Commitments, (y) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Letter of
Credit Advances or (z) the aggregate Available Amount of outstanding Letters of
Credit that, in each case, shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to
take any action hereunder, (iii) release any Credit Party or otherwise limit
such Credit Party's liability with respect to the Obligations owing to the
Agents and the Lenders, (iv) amend this SECTION 9.01, (v) except as provided in
SECTION 2.18, increase the L/C Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders
to any additional obligations, (vi) reduce the principal of, or interest on, any
reimbursement obligation or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, or
increase any Lender's L/C Commitment except as provided in SECTION 2.18, (vii)
postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any
reimbursement obligation or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (viii)
limit the liability of any Credit Party under any of the Credit Documents, or
(ix) release any of the Collateral if such release would cause the aggregate
Collateral Value to be less than the Letter of Credit Outstandings; provided
further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by an Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action,
affect the rights or duties of such Agent under this Agreement or the other
Credit Documents.

         Section 9.02 Notices, Etc.

         (a) All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall

until received by the Administrative Agent. Manual delivery by telecopier of an
executed counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered hereunder shall
be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all communications and reports from the Credit

5.01(d)) may be made by posting to the IntraLinks (or comparable successor

         (b) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally authorizes
RenRe to deliver any and all notices, statements, consents or other
communications required or allowed on behalf of each of the Credit Parties
pursuant to the Credit Documents, and the Administrative

                                       68
<PAGE>

Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders shall be fully
protected in relying upon any such notice, statement, consent or other
communication delivered by RenRe.

         Section 9.03 Costs and Expenses; Indemnification.

         (a) RenRe and each Account Party agrees whether or not the transactions

Default or Event of Default or any events or circumstances that may give rise to
a Default or Event of Default and with respect to presenting claims in or

proceeding affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation
the reasonable Attorney Costs for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender with respect thereto).

         (b) RenRe agrees whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be consummated, to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, the
Arranger, the Issuing Bank, each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an
"Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities and expenses (including without Attorney Costs) that may be incurred
by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising
out of or in connection with or by reason of (including without limitation in
connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a
defense in connection therewith) this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the
actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit Advances or any
of the transactions contemplated thereby or any transaction financed or
supported by (or to be financed or supported by) in whole or in part, directly
or indirectly,

                                       69
<PAGE>

with the proceeds of any Letters of Credit, or any action, suit or proceeding
(including any inquiry or investigation) by any Person, whether threatened or
initiated, related to any of the foregoing, and in any case whether or not such
Indemnified Party is a party to any such action, proceeding or suit or a subject
of any such inquiry or investigation, except to the extent such claim, damage,
loss, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation,
litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this SECTION 9.03(b)
applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation,
litigation or proceeding is brought by any Credit Party, its directors,
shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated by
the Credit Documents are consummated. Each of RenRe and the Account Parties also
agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent, the Arranger, any Lender or
any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating
to the credit facilities provided hereunder, the actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Letter of Credit Advances or the Letters of Credit, the Credit
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents. All
of the foregoing indemnified costs of any Indemnified Party shall be paid or
reimbursed by RenRe, as and when incurred and upon demand.

         (c) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any
Credit Party hereunder or under any other Credit Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Credit Parties contained in SECTION 2.07 and this SECTION
9.03 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other
amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Credit Documents.

         Section 9.04 Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default with respect to such Credit Party and (b)
the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by SECTION
7.02 to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare amounts owing hereunder by
such Credit Party to be due and payable pursuant to the provisions of SECTION
7.02, each Agent and each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all deposits of such
Credit Party (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent, such Lender or
such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of such Credit Party against
any and all of the Obligations of such Credit Party now or hereafter existing
under the Credit Documents, irrespective of whether such Agent or such Lender
shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such Obligations
may be unmatured. Each Agent and each Lender agrees promptly to notify RenRe
after any such set-off and application; provided, however, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
The rights of each Agent and each Lender and their respective Affiliates under
this SECTION 9.04 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
without limitation other rights of set-off) that such Agent, such Lender and
their respective Affiliates may have.

         Section 9.05 Assignments and Participations.

         (a) Each Lender may, and so long as no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, if demanded by RenRe (following a demand
by such Lender pursuant to SECTION 2.12) upon at least five (5) Business Days
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, will, assign to one or more
Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including without limitation all or a portion of its L/C Commitment,
its Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitment and the Letter of Credit
Advances owing to it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be
of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations of
such Lender hereunder, except for any non-pro rata assignment made by a
Downgraded Lender after a request by the Issuing Bank pursuant to SECTION 2.14
(and any subsequent non-pro rata assignment of the interest so assigned by the
Downgraded Lender) and any other non-pro rata assignment approved by the
Administrative Agent and RenRe, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a
Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an Affiliate
of any Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, the aggregate amount of the L/C Commitments being assigned to
such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such assignment (determined as of the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event
be less than $10,000,000 unless it is an assignment of the entire amount of such
assignor's L/C Commitment, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
Assignee, (iv) each assignment made as a result of a demand by RenRe pursuant to
SECTION 2.12 shall be arranged by RenRe after consultation with the
Administrative Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and
obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a
portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such
assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and
obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be
obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by RenRe pursuant
to SECTION 2.12 unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more
payments from either the applicable Account Party or other Eligible Assignees in
an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of the Letter of Credit Advances made by such Lender, together with accrued
interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other
amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, (vi) as a result of such
assignment, no Account Party shall be subject to additional amounts under
SECTION 2.06 or 2.08 and (vii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the
Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,500.00. In connection with each assignment permitted
hereunder, RenRe agrees to cause to be provided to the assignee, upon request,
the opinions described in SECTION 3.01(i)(J) (whether by a reliance provision in
the original opinion or by a reliance letter or new opinion delivered to the
assignee).

         (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender, hereunder and (ii) the
Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (other than its rights under SECTIONS 2.06, 2.08 and 9.03
to the extent any claim thereunder

                                       71
<PAGE>

relates to an event arising prior to such assignment and any other rights that
are expressly provided hereunder to survive) and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto).

         (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, each
Lender assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties thereto and hereto as follows: (i) other
than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes
no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any
Credit Document or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien
or security interest created or purported to be created under or in connection
with, any Credit Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
thereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and

obligations under any Credit Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a
copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements
referred to in SECTION 5.01 and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
the Credit Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

         (d) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose (but only for
this purpose) as the agent of the Account Parties, shall maintain at its address
referred to in SECTION 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and the L/C Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Letter of Credit Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error, and the Credit Parties, the Agents and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by any Credit Party or any Agent or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee, the Administrative Agent shall, if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
EXHIBIT B hereto, (i) accept such Assignment

                                       72
<PAGE>

and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to RenRe and to the parties to such
Assignment and Acceptance.

         (f) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons (other
than any Credit Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation all or
a portion of its L/C Commitment, its Letter of Credit Participating Interest
Commitment and the Letter of Credit Advances owing to it); provided, however,
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including without
limitation its Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitment) shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Credit Parties, the
Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and (iv) no participant under any such participation shall have any
right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Credit
Document, or any consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, except
to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal
of, or interest on, reimbursement obligations or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation,
postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
reimbursement obligations or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in
each case to the extent subject to such participation. Each Lender shall, as
agent of the Account Parties solely for the purposes of this Section, record in
book entries maintained by such Lender, the name and amount of the participating
interest of each Person entitled to receive payments in respect of any
participating interests sold pursuant to this Section.

         (g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this SECTION 9.05, disclose
to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any
information relating to any Credit Party furnished to such Lender by or on
behalf of any Credit Party; provided, however, that, prior to any such
disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
received by it from such Lender.

         (h) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including without limitation the Letter of
Credit Advances owing to it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance
with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

         Section 9.06 No Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the
Lenders expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents are
cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and
remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise. No failure or delay on the
part of any Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a
waiver of any Substitution Event, Suspension Event, Default or Event of Default.
No course of dealing between any of the Credit Parties and the Agents or the
Lenders or their agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify or
discharge any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or to

                                       73
<PAGE>

constitute a waiver of any Substitution Event, Suspension Event, Default or
Event of Default. No notice to or demand upon any Credit Party in any case shall
entitle such Credit Party or any other Credit Party to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the
right of any Agent or any Lender to exercise any right or remedy or take any
other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

         Section 9.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto, and all references herein to any party shall
be deemed to include its successors and assigns; provided, however, that (i)
none of the Credit Parties shall sell, assign or transfer any of its rights,
interests, duties or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of all of the Lenders and (ii) any assignees and participants shall have
such rights and obligations with respect to this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents as are provided for under and pursuant to the provisions of SECTION
9.05.

         Section 9.08 Survival. All representations, warranties and agreements
made by or on behalf of the Credit Parties in this Agreement and in the other
Credit Documents shall survive the execution and delivery hereof or thereof and
the issuance and repayment of the Letters of Credit. In addition,
notwithstanding anything herein or under applicable law to the contrary, the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents relating to
indemnification or payment of fees, costs and expenses shall survive the
termination of all Letter of Credit Participating Interest Commitments and
commitments to issue Letters of Credit, the termination or expiration of all
Letters of Credit and the payment in full of all principal and interest with
respect to Letter of Credit Advances, and any termination of this Agreement or
any of the other Credit Documents.

         Section 9.09 Severability. To the extent any provision of this
Agreement is prohibited by or invalid under the applicable law of any
jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity and only in such jurisdiction, without prohibiting or
invalidating such provision in any other jurisdiction or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.

         Section 9.10 Construction. The headings of the various articles,
sections and subsections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience
only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any of the
provisions hereof. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and in the
other Credit Documents, in the event of any inconsistency or conflict between
any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any of the other Credit
Documents, the provision of this Agreement shall control.

         Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to keep confidential,
pursuant to its customary procedures for handling confidential information of a
similar nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, all
nonpublic information provided to it by or on behalf of the Credit Parties in
connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided, however,
that any Lender may disclose such information (a) to its directors, employees
and agents and to its auditors, counsel and other professional advisors, (b) at
the demand or request of any bank regulatory authority, court or other
Governmental Authority having or asserting jurisdiction over such Lender, as may
be required pursuant to subpoena or other legal process, or

                                       74
<PAGE>

otherwise in order to comply with any applicable Requirement of Law, (c) in
connection with any proceeding to enforce its rights hereunder, under any other
Credit Document or in any other litigation or proceeding in connection with the
Credit Documents, (d) to the Agents or any other Lender, (e) to the extent the
same has become publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this
Agreement and (f) pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of SECTION
9.05.

         Section 9.12 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an

instrument. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a
counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto and receipt by the
Administrative Agent and RenRe of written or telephonic notification of such
