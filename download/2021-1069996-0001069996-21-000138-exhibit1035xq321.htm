FIN_5166.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;NET QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;NO. FIN_5166.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Agreement&quot;) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;between &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;FEDNAT INSURANCE COMPANY &nbsp;&nbsp;Sunrise, Florida &nbsp;&nbsp; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Company&quot;) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;SWISS REINSURANCE AMERICA CORPORATION &nbsp;&nbsp;Armonk, New York &nbsp;&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Reinsurer&quot;) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE I - BUSINESS COVERED &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A. By this Agreement the Company obligates itself to cede to the Reinsurer and the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer obligates itself to accept from the Company a 20% Quota Share &nbsp;&nbsp;participation of the Company's Ultimate Net Liability for Policies in force as of July &nbsp;&nbsp;1, 2021, and new and renewal Policies becoming effective on or after July 1, 2021, &nbsp;&nbsp;as respects losses occurring on or after July 1, 2021, subject to Paragraph B.  This &nbsp;&nbsp;Quota Share is subject to the maximum cession limits set forth below: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Property Business &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;$[***] each risk (20% share of the Company's Ultimate Net Liability of $[***]), &nbsp;&nbsp;but in no event shall the Reinsurer's liability from all risks in any one Loss &nbsp;&nbsp;Occurrence exceed $[***] (20% of $[***]).  It is understood that the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company's $[***] limit reflects their portion of the retention under the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company's Catastrophe Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement of July 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;2021 (&quot;Common Agreement&quot;) which also reinsures Monarch National &nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance Company and Maison Insurance Company (neither of which are &nbsp;&nbsp;subject to this Agreement).  Should the event from which a Loss Occurrence &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder arises also include losses sustained by Monarch National &nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance Company and/or Maison Insurance Company under the &nbsp;&nbsp;Common Agreement, the $[***] limit addressed in this paragraph could be &nbsp;&nbsp;reduced proportionately to reflect the Company&#8217;s retained share of the total &nbsp;&nbsp;losses under the retention of the Common Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the limits stated above, the Reinsurer's liability shall not &nbsp;&nbsp;exceed $[***] (20% of $[***]) as respects all Loss Occurrences taking place &nbsp;&nbsp;during the term of this Agreement.  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Casualty Business &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;EFFECTIVE: JULY 1, 2021                                   2.  FIN_5166.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;$[***] each Policy each Loss Occurrence (20% share of the Company's &nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimate Net Liability of $[***].)   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;B. The cession percentage set forth in Paragraph A. of this Article may be adjusted up &nbsp;&nbsp;to three times during the Agreement Year, subject to the following:   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Company has provided the Reinsurer no less than 45 day's written &nbsp;&nbsp;notice prior to the end of any calendar quarter during the Agreement Year, &nbsp;&nbsp;of its desire to adjust the cession percentage prospectively.   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;2. The adjusted cession percentage shall not be less than 2% nor greater than &nbsp;&nbsp;20%.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;3. The cession adjustment is to take effect as respects in force, new and &nbsp;&nbsp;renewal business on a prospective basis on the last day of the calendar &nbsp;&nbsp;quarter in which such notice was given as respects Loss Occurrences taking &nbsp;&nbsp;place on or after such date; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Such cession adjustment shall be at the election of the Company only if the &nbsp;&nbsp;Loss Ratio from Agreement inception through the end of the quarter in which &nbsp;&nbsp;such notice was given is less than or equal to 30%. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;5. If such Loss Ratio is greater than 30%, any such cession adjustment must &nbsp;&nbsp;be mutually agreed by both parties.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;6. Mutual agreement of the parties to any cession adjustment is evidenced by &nbsp;&nbsp;addendum to this Agreement signed by both parties. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Paragraph B., &quot;Loss Ratio&quot; shall mean the actual ratio of &nbsp;&nbsp;Incurred Losses to Earned Premiums from Agreement inception to the end of the &nbsp;&nbsp;calendar quarter for which calculation is being made.  The terms &quot;Incurred Losses&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;and &quot;Earned Premiums&quot; shall be defined as they are under Article X - Sliding Scale &nbsp;&nbsp;Commission, provided however, as respects Incurred Losses, there will be no &nbsp;&nbsp;Incurred But Not Reported (&quot;IBNR&quot;) losses included. &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Loss Adjustment Expenses and any loss arising under this Agreement with respect &nbsp;&nbsp;to Loss In Excess of Policy Limits and Extra Contractual Obligations, as defined &nbsp;&nbsp;herein, shall be recovered in the same proportion as the contractual loss &nbsp;&nbsp;recoverable hereunder; provided such contractual loss plus Loss Adjustment &nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses, Loss In Excess of Policy Limits and Extra Contractual Obligations shall &nbsp;&nbsp;never exceed the maximum cession limits set forth under Paragraph A. above. &nbsp;&nbsp;D. This Agreement is solely between the Company and the Reinsurer, and nothing &nbsp;&nbsp;contained in this Agreement shall create any obligations or establish any rights &nbsp;&nbsp;against the Reinsurer in favor of any person or entity not a party hereto. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E. The performance of obligations by both parties under this Agreement shall be in &nbsp;&nbsp;accordance with a fiduciary standard of good faith and fair dealing. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

Under this Agreement, the indemnity for reinsured loss applies only to the following &nbsp;&nbsp;Property and Casualty Business except as excluded under Article VI - Exclusions &nbsp;&nbsp;of this Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;PROPERTY LINES OF BUSINESS &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowners (Section I only) &nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelling Fire (Section I only) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;CASUALTY LINES OF BUSINESS &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowners (Section II only)  &nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelling Fire (Section II only) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE II - EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A. This Agreement shall become effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, July &nbsp;&nbsp;1, 2021, and shall terminate at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Standard Time on July 1, 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Upon termination of this Agreement:  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1. All reinsurance hereunder shall be automatically cancelled as of the date of &nbsp;&nbsp;termination and the Reinsurer shall be released of all liability as respects &nbsp;&nbsp;losses occurring on or after the date of termination.  The Reinsurer shall &nbsp;&nbsp;return to the Company the unearned premiums on the business in force &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder at the date of termination, less the commission allowed thereon. &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Alternatively, at the Company's option, and provided written notice of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company's election of such option is given to the Reinsurer by certified mail, &nbsp;&nbsp;electronic mail or by a courier service each producing evidence of receipt &nbsp;&nbsp;by the Reinsurer prior to the date of termination, this Agreement will &nbsp;&nbsp;terminate on a &quot;Run-off&quot; basis and the Reinsurer shall be liable for losses &nbsp;&nbsp;occurring on or after to the date of termination for all Policies covered &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder and in force at the date of termination of this Agreement until &nbsp;&nbsp;their natural expiry, cancellation or next anniversary of such business, &nbsp;&nbsp;whichever first occurs; but in no case shall the Reinsurer be liable for losses &nbsp;&nbsp;occurring more than 12 months after the termination date unless the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company is required by statute or regulation to continue coverage on a &nbsp;&nbsp;Policy.  In such case, the Reinsurer shall continue to be liable for losses &nbsp;&nbsp;occurring subsequent to the date of termination until the earliest date on &nbsp;&nbsp;which the Company may cancel such Policy.  The Reinsurer shall return to &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company the unearned premiums, if any, less commissions applicable, &nbsp;&nbsp;for the unexpired periods. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE III &#8211; TERRITORY &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As respects Property Business, this Agreement applies to risks located in Florida. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;EFFECTIVE: JULY 1, 2021                                   4.  FIN_5166.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As respects Casualty Business, the Agreement applies to Policies issued by the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;within Florida and shall apply to losses covered hereunder wherever occurring. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE IV - RETENTION &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The Company warrants that it shall retain net for its own account and not reinsure &nbsp;&nbsp;in any way, 60% of its Ultimate Net Liability.  In addition to the initial cession of 20% &nbsp;&nbsp;of its Ultimate Net Liability to the Reinsurer pursuant to this Agreement, it is &nbsp;&nbsp;understood that the Company is also reinsuring an additional 20% of its Ultimate &nbsp;&nbsp;Net Liability for the Business Covered as follows:  (i) a 10% cession pursuant to an &nbsp;&nbsp;additional Quota Share Agreement with the Reinsurer in effect from November 15, &nbsp;&nbsp;2020 to November 15, 2021, and (ii) a 10% cession through additional reinsurance &nbsp;&nbsp;procured through the broker market. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. In the event there is a cession adjustment pursuant to Paragraph B. of Article I &#8211; &nbsp;&nbsp;Business Covered, the Company's net retention shall be revised to reflect the &nbsp;&nbsp;difference between the revised cession percentage and 100% as of the effective &nbsp;&nbsp;date of the change. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE V &#8211; DEFINITIONS &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A. AGREEMENT YEAR &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Agreement Year&quot; shall mean the 12-month period commencing July 1, 2021 and &nbsp;&nbsp;continuing through June 30, 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B.

The date on which an Extra Contractual Obligation is incurred by the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company shall be deemed, in all circumstances, to be the date of the &nbsp;&nbsp;original accident, casualty, disaster or loss occurrence. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;3. However, coverage hereunder as respects Extra Contractual Obligations &nbsp;&nbsp;shall not apply where the loss has been incurred due to the fraud of a &nbsp;&nbsp;member of the Board of Directors or a corporate officer of the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;acting individually or collectively or in collusion with any individual or &nbsp;&nbsp;corporation or any other organization or party involved in the presentation, &nbsp;&nbsp;defense or settlement of any claim covered hereunder. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Recoveries, collectibles or retention from any other form of insurance or &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsurance including deductibles or self-insured retention which protect the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company against Extra Contractual Obligations, whether collectible or not, &nbsp;&nbsp;shall inure to the benefit of the Reinsurer and shall be deducted from the &nbsp;&nbsp;total amount of Extra Contractual Obligations for purposes of determining &nbsp;&nbsp;the loss hereunder. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;5.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the word &quot;loss&quot; shall mean any amounts &nbsp;&nbsp;which the Company would have been contractually liable to pay had it not &nbsp;&nbsp;been for the limit of the original Policy. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4. With respect to coverage provided under this paragraph, recoveries from &nbsp;&nbsp;any insurance or reinsurance other than this Agreement, whether collectible &nbsp;&nbsp;or not, shall be deducted to arrive at the amount of the Company's Ultimate &nbsp;&nbsp;Net Liability. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;G.

Procedure Governing Arbitration - All proceedings before the panel shall be &nbsp;&nbsp;informal and the panel shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence.  The &nbsp;&nbsp;panel shall have the power to fix all procedural rules relating to the arbitration &nbsp;&nbsp;proceeding.

The Reinsurer &nbsp;&nbsp;shall have the right to investigate each such claim or loss and interpose, at its own &nbsp;&nbsp;expense, in the proceedings where the claim or loss is to be adjudicated, any &nbsp;&nbsp;defense which it may deem available to the Company, its liquidator, receiver, &nbsp;&nbsp;conservator or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be chargeable, subject to court approval, against the insolvent Company as &nbsp;&nbsp;part of the expense of liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit &nbsp;&nbsp;which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by &nbsp;&nbsp;the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C.
