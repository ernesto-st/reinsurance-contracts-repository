<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Obligors and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, hereby acknowledge and agree that the security interest created hereby in the Collateral (i)&nbsp;constitutes continuing collateral security for all of the Secured Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter arising and (ii)&nbsp;is not to be construed as an assignment of any copyrights, patents, trademarks or any licenses therefor.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</B>3.&#9;<U>Representations and Warranties</U>. Each Obligor hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, that until such time as the Secured Obligations have been Fully Satisfied:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Ownership</U>. Each Obligor has the right to pledge, sell, assign or transfer the Collateral in which it has an interest. There exists no "adverse claim" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;8-302 of the UCC as of the date hereof with respect to the Subsidiary Equity of such Obligor. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Security Interest/Priority</U>. This Agreement, when executed and delivered and upon the making of the initial Loans under the Credit Agreement, creates a valid security interest in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in the Collateral of such Obligor and, when properly perfected by filing, shall constitute a valid perfected security interest in such Collateral (including all uncertificated Subsidiary Equity consisting of partnership or limited liability company interests that do not constitute a security pursuant to Section 8-103(c) of the UCC), to the extent such security can be perfected by filing under the UCC, free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. The taking possession by the Administrative Agent of the certificates (if any) representing the Subsidiary Equity and all other Instruments constituting Collateral will perfect and establish the first priority of the Administrative Agent's security interest in all certificated Subsidiary Equity and such Instruments. With respect to any Collateral consisting of a Securities Entitlement or held in a Securities Account, upon execution and delivery by the applicable Obligor, the applicable Securities Intermediary and the Administrative Agent of an agreement granting Control to the Administrative Agent over such Collateral, the Administrative Agent shall have a first priority perfected security interest in such Collateral.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Types of Collateral</U>. None of the Collateral consists of, or is the Proceeds of, (i) As-Extracted Collateral, (ii) Consumer Goods, (iii) Farm Products, (iv) Manufactured Homes or (v) Standing Timber.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(e)&#9;<U>Equipment and Inventory</U>. With respect to any material Equipment and/or Inventory of an Obligor, each such Obligor has exclusive possession and control of such Equipment and Inventory of such Obligor except for (i) Equipment leased by such Obligor as a lessee, (ii) Equipment or Inventory in transit with common or other carriers, or (iii) Equipment or Inventory located at premises leased by such Obligor for which the Loan Parties are using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver from the landlord of such premises to the extent required by <U>Section 7.16(b)</U> of the Credit Agreement. No material Inventory is held by an Obligor pursuant to consignment, sale or return, sale on approval or similar arrangement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(f)&#9;<U>Authorization of Subsidiary Equity</U>. All Subsidiary Equity is duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and is not subject to the preemptive rights of any Person.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(g)&#9;<U>Exercising of Rights</U>. The exercise by the Administrative Agent of its rights and remedies hereunder will not violate any law or governmental regulation or any material contractual restriction that, in either case, is binding on or affecting an Obligor or any of its Property, except (1) as contemplated by <U>Section 7(g)</U> hereof, and (2) as contemplated by <U>Section 6.03</U> of the Credit Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(h)&#9;<U>Obligor's Authority</U>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;<U>No Other Shares</U>. As of the Closing Date, no Obligor owns any shares of Capital Stock of any Person required to be pledged pursuant to <U>Section 7.13</U> of the Credit Agreement other than the Subsidiary Equity set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;1(b)</U> attached hereto.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(j)&#9;<U>Initial Pledged Debt</U>. As of the Closing Date, and except for any Instruments evidencing Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Investment pursuant to <U>Section 8.02(a)</U> of the Credit Agreement, the Initial Pledged Debt constitutes (i) all of the Instruments payable to or owned by such Obligor, except for notes and other Instruments with an outstanding principal amount of less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and (ii) all of the Instruments required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to <U>Section 7.13</U> of the Credit Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(k)&#9;<U>Partnership and Limited Liability Company Interests</U>. Except as previously disclosed to the Administrative Agent, none of the Subsidiary Equity consisting of partnership or limited liability company interests (i) is dealt in or traded on a securities exchange or in a securities market, (ii) by its terms expressly provides that it is a security governed by Article 8 of the UCC, (iii) is an investment company security, (iv) is held in a securities account or (v) constitutes a "security" or a "financial asset" as such terms are defined in Article 8 of the UCC.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(ii) In accordance with and subject to the terms of <U>Section 7.13</U> of the Credit Agreement, each Obligor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent promptly upon the receipt thereof by or on behalf of an Obligor, all other certificates and instruments constituting Subsidiary Equity of an Obligor. Prior to delivery to the Administrative Agent, all such certificates and instruments constituting Subsidiary Equity of an Obligor shall be held in trust by such Obligor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent pursuant hereto. All such certificates representing Subsidiary Equity shall be delivered in suitable form for transfer by delivery or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, substantially in the form provided in <U>Schedule&nbsp;4(a)(ii)</U> attached hereto.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Change in Corporate Structure or Location</U>. Not, without providing 30 days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and without filing such amendments to any previously filed financing statements as the Administrative Agent may require, change its registered legal name, be party to a merger, consolidation or other change in corporate structure or change its jurisdiction of organization other than as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;6.20(c)</U> of the Credit Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Filing of Financing Statements, Notices, etc</U>. Each Obligor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to prepare and file such financing statements (including renewal statements) or amendments thereof or supplements thereto or other instruments as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably deem necessary or appropriate in order to perfect and maintain the security interests granted hereunder in accordance with the UCC. Each Obligor shall also execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such agreements, assignments or instruments (including affidavits, notices, reaffirmations and amendments and restatements of existing documents, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request) and do all such other things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate (i)&nbsp;to assure to the Administrative Agent its security interests hereunder, including (A)&nbsp;such financing statements (including renewal statements) or amendments thereof or supplements thereto or other instruments as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request in order to perfect and maintain the security interests granted hereunder in accordance with the UCC, (B)&nbsp;with regard to copyrights and copyright applications, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Copyrights in the form of <U>Schedule&nbsp;4(c)(i)</U>, (C)&nbsp;with regard to patents and patent applications, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Patents for filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the form of <U>Schedule&nbsp;4(c)(ii)</U> attached hereto and (D)&nbsp;with regard to trademarks and trademark applications, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Trademarks for filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the form of <U>Schedule&nbsp;4(c)(iii)</U> attached hereto, (ii)&nbsp;to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)&nbsp;to otherwise protect and assure the Administrative Agent of its rights and interests hereunder. To that end, each Obligor agrees that the Administrative Agent may file one or more financing statements disclosing the Administrative Agent's security interest in any or all of the Collateral of such Obligor without, to the extent permitted by law, such Obligor's signature thereon, and further each Obligor also hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Administrative Agent, its nominee or any other person whom the Administrative Agent may designate, as such Obligor's attorney in fact with full power and for the limited purpose to sign in the name of such Obligor any such financing statements, or amendments and supplements to financing statements, renewal financing statements, notices or any similar documents which in the Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion would be necessary, appropriate or convenient in order to perfect and maintain perfection of the security interests granted hereunder, such power, being coupled with an interest, being and remaining irrevocable until such time as the Secured Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. Each Obligor hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent is authorized to file a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any such financing statement as a financing statement by the Administrative Agent without notice thereof to such Obligor wherever the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion desire to file the same. In the event for any reason the law of any jurisdiction other than New York becomes or is applicable to the Collateral of any Obligor or any part thereof, or to any of the Secured Obligations, such Obligor agrees to execute and deliver all such instruments and to do all such other things as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion reasonably deems necessary or appropriate to preserve, protect and enforce the security interests of the Administrative Agent under the law of such other jurisdiction (and, if an Obligor shall fail to do so promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may execute any and all such requested documents on behalf of such Obligor pursuant to the power of attorney granted hereinabove). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(d)&#9;<U>Control</U>.

Not without executing and delivering, or causing to be executed and delivered, to the Administrative Agent such agreements, documents and instruments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require, issue or acquire any Capital Stock consisting of an interest in a partnership or a limited liability company that (i) is dealt in or traded on a securities exchange or in a securities market, (ii) by its terms expressly provides that it is a security governed by Article 8 of the UCC, (iii) is an investment company security, (iv) is held in a securities account or (v) constitutes a "security" or a "financial asset" as such terms are defined in Article 8 of the UCC, other than with respect to Capital Stock of Excluded Subsidiaries.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;</B>(m)&#9;To the extent any proceeds of any Loan are used to purchase Collateral, the Borrower's repayment of such Loan shall apply on a "first-in-first-out" basis so that the portion of such Loan used to purchase a particular item of Collateral shall be paid in the chronological order that such Collateral was purchased.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(n)&#9;<U>Insurance</U>. Insure, repair and replace the Collateral of such Obligor as set forth in the Credit Agreement.

</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;5.&#9;<U>Advances by Lenders</U>. On failure of any Obligor to perform any of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole option and in its sole discretion, perform the same and in so doing may expend such sums as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem advisable in the performance thereof, including, without limitation, the payment of any insurance premiums, the payment of any taxes, a payment to obtain a release of a Lien or potential Lien, expenditures made in defending against any adverse claim and all other expenditures which the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may make for the protection of the security hereof or which may be compelled to make by operation of law. All such sums and amounts so expended shall be repayable by the Obligors on a joint and several basis promptly upon timely notice thereof and demand therefor, shall constitute additional Secured Obligations and shall bear interest from the date said amounts are expended at the Default Rate. No such performance of any covenant or agreement by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on behalf of any Obligor, and no such advance or expenditure therefor, shall relieve the Obligors of any Default or Event of Default. The Lenders may make any payment hereby authorized in accordance with any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office or holder of the claim to be discharged without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien, title or claim except to the extent such payment is being contested in good faith by an Obligor in appropriate proceedings and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;6.&#9;<U>Remedies</U>.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;<U>General Remedies</U>. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Lenders shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies provided herein, in the Loan Documents, in the Swap Contracts between any Obligor and any Lender, or under applicable Laws (including, but not limited to, levy of attachment, garnishment and the rights and remedies set forth in the Uniform Commercial Code of the jurisdiction applicable to the affected Collateral), the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (regardless of whether the UCC is the law of the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted and regardless of whether the UCC applies to the affected Collateral), and further, the Administrative Agent may, with or without judicial process or the aid and assistance of others, (i)&nbsp;enter on any premises on which any of the Collateral may be located and, without resistance or interference by the Obligors, take possession of the Collateral, (ii)&nbsp;dispose of any Collateral on any such premises, (iii)&nbsp;require the Obligors to assemble and make available to the Administrative Agent at the expense of the Obligors any Collateral at any place and time designated by the Administrative Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties, (iv)&nbsp;remove any Collateral from any such premises for the purpose of effecting sale or other disposition thereof, and/or (v)&nbsp;without demand and without advertisement, notice, hearing or process of law, all of which each of the Obligors hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, at any place and time or times, sell and deliver any or all Collateral held by or for it at public or private sale (which in the case of a private sale of Subsidiary Equity, shall be to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof), at any exchange or broker's board or elsewhere, by one or more contracts, in one or more parcels, for cash, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Administrative Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion (subject to any and all mandatory legal requirements). Each Obligor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and, in the case of a sale of Subsidiary Equity, that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to delay sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such securities to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933. To the extent the rights of notice cannot be legally waived hereunder, each Obligor agrees that any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the Borrower in accordance with the notice provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;11.02</U> of the Credit Agreement at least 10 Business Days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice. Each Obligor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell any Subsidiary Equity which has been (i)&nbsp;publicly advertised on a bona fide basis in a newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial community of New York, New York (to the extent that such offer may be advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act of 1933), or (ii)&nbsp;made privately in the manner described above shall be deemed to involve a "public sale" under the UCC, notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a "public offering" under the Securities Act of 1933, and the Administrative Agent may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by law, any Lender may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Obligors hereby waives all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject to the provisions of applicable law, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by law, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Remedies relating to Accounts</U>. During the continuation of an Event of Default, whether or not the Administrative Agent has exercised any or all of its rights and remedies hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enforce any Obligor's rights against any account debtors and obligors on such Obligor's Accounts. Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Proceeds of its Accounts remitted to or on behalf of the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be solely for the Administrative Agent's own convenience and that such Obligor shall not have any right, title or interest in such Accounts or in any such other amounts except as expressly provided herein. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no liability or responsibility to any Obligor for acceptance of a check, draft or other order for payment of money bearing the legend "payment in full" or words of similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement or be responsible for determining the correctness of any remittance. Furthermore, during the continuation of an Event of Default, (i)&nbsp;the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make test verifications of the Accounts in any manner and through any medium that it reasonably considers advisable, and the Obligors shall furnish all such assistance and information as the Administrative Agent may require in connection with such test verifications, (ii) upon the Administrative Agent's request and at the expense of the Obligors, the Obligors shall cause independent public accountants or others satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to furnish to the Administrative Agent reports showing reconciliations, aging and test verifications of, and trial balances for, the Accounts and (iii) the Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may communicate with account debtors on the Accounts to verify with them to the Administrative Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any Accounts.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Access</U>. In addition to the rights and remedies hereunder, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enter and remain upon the various premises of the Obligors without cost or charge to the Administrative Agent, and use the same, together with materials, supplies, books and records of the Obligors for the purpose of collecting and liquidating the Collateral, or for preparing for sale and conducting the sale of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise. In addition, the Administrative Agent may remove Collateral, or any part thereof, from such premises and/or any records with respect thereto, in order to effectively collect or liquidate such Collateral.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(d)&#9;<U>Nonexclusive Nature of Remedies</U>. Failure by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to exercise any right, remedy or option under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Swap Contract between any Obligor and any Lender, or as provided by law, or any delay by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in exercising the same, shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, remedy or option. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically stated, which in the case of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall only be granted as provided herein. To the extent permitted by law, neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, nor any party acting as attorney for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than their gross negligence or willful misconduct hereunder. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agents and the Lenders under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or the Lenders may have.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(e)&#9;<U>Retention of Collateral</U>. The Administrative Agent may, in compliance with Sections&nbsp;9-620 and 9-621 of the UCC or otherwise complying with the requirements of applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction, accept or retain the Collateral in satisfaction of the Secured Obligations. Unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have provided such notices, however, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have retained any Collateral in satisfaction of any Secured Obligations for any reason.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(f)&#9;<U>Deficiency</U>. In the event that the proceeds of any sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Administrative Agent or the Lenders are legally entitled, the Obligors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate, together with the costs of collection and the reasonable fees of any attorneys employed by the Administrative Agent to collect such deficiency. Any surplus remaining after the full payment and satisfaction of the Secured Obligations shall be returned to the Obligors or to whomsoever a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine to be entitled thereto.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(a)&#9;<U>Power of Attorney</U>. In addition to other powers of attorney contained herein, each Obligor hereby designates and appoints the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, and each of its designees or agents, as attorney-in-fact of such Obligor, irrevocably and with power of substitution, with authority to take any or all of the following actions upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(i)&#9;to demand, collect, settle, compromise, adjust or give discharges and releases, all as the Administrative Agent may reasonably determine;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(ii)&#9;to commence and prosecute any actions at any court for the purposes of collecting any Collateral and enforcing any other right in respect thereof;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(iii)&#9;to defend, settle or compromise any action brought and, in connection therewith, give such discharge or release as the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably appropriate;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(iv)&#9;receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to an Obligor and endorse checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or other instruments or documents evidencing payment, shipment or storage of the goods giving rise to the Collateral of such Obligor on behalf of and in the name of such Obligor, or securing, or relating to such Collateral;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(v)&#9;sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any Collateral or the goods or services which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(vi)&#9;adjust and settle claims under any insurance policy relating thereto;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(vii)&#9;execute and deliver all assignments, conveyances, statements, financing statements, renewal financing statements, security agreements, affidavits, notices and other agreements, instruments and documents that the Administrative Agent may determine necessary in order to perfect and maintain the security interests and liens granted in this Agreement and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated therein;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;(viii)&#9;institute any foreclosure proceedings that the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(ix)&#9;do and perform all such other acts and things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem to be necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the Collateral.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until such time as the Secured Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct. This power of attorney is conferred on the Administrative Agent solely to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;<U>Performance by the Administrative Agent of Obligations</U>. If any Obligor fails to perform any agreement or obligation contained herein, the Administrative Agent itself may perform, or cause performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Obligors on a joint and several basis pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;11.04</U> of the Credit Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)&#9;<U>Assignment by the Administrative Agent</U>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(d)&#9;<U>The Administrative Agent's Duty of Care</U>. Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral while being held by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Obligors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral, and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to the Obligors. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up, repair or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(e) &#9;<U>Liability with Respect to Accounts</U>. The Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation or liability under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment relating to such Account pursuant hereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of an Obligor under or pursuant to any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.</P>
