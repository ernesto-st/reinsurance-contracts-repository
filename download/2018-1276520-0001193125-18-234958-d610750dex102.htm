(the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;).&nbsp;The corporate merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the &#147;Merger&#148;) is currently expected to be completed during 2018, although this is not guaranteed (if and when completed, the
&#147;Closing&#148;).&nbsp;The following provisions are contingent upon the Closing of the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(1) <U>Adjustment of
Award</U>.&nbsp;Pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.4 of the Plan, the Committee may in its sole discretion make such adjustments to the Award to reflect the Merger or otherwise prevent dilution or enlargement of rights or benefits thereunder, as it deems
appropriate.&nbsp;The Committee expects that it will make adjustments to the Award to reflect the expected impact of the Merger, which may include, without limitation, adjustments to the performance goals set forth on this <U>Exhibit A</U> for each
of the performance measurement periods hereunder, adjustments deemed necessary or appropriate to properly reflect the conversion to purchase GAAP accounting and any other changes in accounting rules or tax laws, and adjustments related to any
reorganization or restructuring plans programs.&nbsp;Any such adjustment will be communicated to you in writing, shall be binding on all persons and shall not constitute an amendment of this Award. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(2) Qualifying Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement and the Plan, the Committee has determined that the Closing of the Merger
pursuant to its current terms would be a Change of Control that constitutes a&nbsp;&#147;Qualifying Change of Control&#148; pursuant to which a &#147;Successor Entity&#148; will &#147;Assume and Maintain&#148; this Award of Units.&nbsp;Thus, the
provisions of Section&nbsp;6(b) of this Agreement, which provides special rules for the vesting of the Units upon certain terminations of employment within 12 months following a Change of Control, will apply following the Closing. </P>
