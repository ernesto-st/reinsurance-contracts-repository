If an Account Party shall be required by law to deduct any Covered Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under the Credit Documents to the Lender, (a) such Account Party shall forthwith pay to the Lender such additional amounts as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for Covered Taxes the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made and (b) such Account Party shall make such deductions and shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. Account Parties shall, upon request, provide appropriate documentation, including receipts, evidencing payment by Account Parties of any such Covered Taxes.

<p align=left><font size=2>The obligations of Account Parties under this Section 6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the repayment of all Reimbursement Amounts and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.</font></p>

    in, any applicable law, rule, regulation or official directive (whether or
    not having the force of law), or in the interpretation or application thereof
    by any Governmental Authority after the date hereof which results in an increase
    in the cost to Lender of making or maintaining, or which reduces the rate
    of return on capital of Lender as a consequence of its obligations with respect
    to, Letters of Credit by reason of reserve, capital adequacy or similar requirements,
    or which results in a reduction of amounts otherwise receivable by Lender
    from Account Parties of Reimbursement Amounts, interest or other fees and
    charges hereunder and thereunder by reason of any tax (other than tax on
    the overall net income of Lender), levy, impost, fee, charge, withholding
    or similar requirements of any kind, Account Parties will pay to Lender upon
    demand an amount equal to such actual increased cost or reduction; provided
    that this Section&nbsp;7 shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively
    by Section&nbsp;6 hereof. If an Account Party becomes liable for the payment
    of any additional amounts by reason of the immediately preceding sentence,
    it may avoid further liability for such additional amounts by seeking and
    obtaining replacements of such Letters of Credit from other financial institutions
    satisfactory to Lender which fully cancel all obligations of Lender under
    such Letters of Credit (which shall thereupon be promptly returned to Lender)
    and the relevant Application and paying to Lender in full on the date of
    replacement all Reimbursement Amounts, interest, fees and other amounts or
    charges due relating to such obligations. The obligations of Account Parties
    under this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the
    repayment of all Reimbursement Amounts and all other amounts payable hereunder
    and under the other Credit Documents.</font></p>
