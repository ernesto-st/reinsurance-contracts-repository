Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without the  implication that the following activities otherwise would be subject to the provisions of  this Clause 13.4, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude, prohibit or restrict the Seller  or any of its Relevant Affiliates from engaging, or require the Seller or any of its  Relevant Affiliates not to engage, in any manner in any of the following:  (a) making investments in the ordinary course of business, including in a general  or separate account of an insurance company, directly or indirectly, in a person  engaged in the Competing Business; provided, that each such investment is a  passive investment of less than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding  securities of such person and where neither the Seller nor any of its Relevant  Affiliates has the ability to control any such entity;  (b) selling any of its assets or businesses to any person;  (c) acquiring, merging or combining with any business, person or assets that would  otherwise violate the restrictions of this Clause 13.4 after the Completion Date  (an &#8220;After-Acquired Business&#8221;) and following such acquisition, merger or  combination, operating such After-Acquired Business; provided, that as of the  date of such acquisition, merger or combination, the net operating revenue from  such Competing Business constituted no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the  total net operating revenue of such After-Acquired Business on a consolidated  basis (measured in accordance with the accounting principles principally  applicable to such After-Acquired Business) for the most recent fiscal year  value; provided, further, that following such acquisition, merger or  combination, no Competing Business undertaken by such After-Acquired  Business shall represent, in any fiscal quarter during the three (3) year period  following the Completion Date, more than fifteen percent (15%) of the net  operating revenue on a consolidated basis of such After-Acquired Business; or  (d) those business lines set out in Schedule 16 (Business Lines) to the extent carried  on by the Retained Group immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.  General  13.5 The Parties acknowledge and confirm that the provisions of Clauses 13.1 to 13.4 are  reasonable in all the circumstances and any breach of Clauses 13.1 to 13.4 would have  a material impact on the Purchaser&#8217;s Group (or the relevant member(s) of the Purchaser  Group), and therefore the provisions of Clauses 13.1 to 13.4 are wholly reasonable as  to scope, nature and duration to protect the legitimate interests of the Purchaser Group.  </FONT></DIV>
