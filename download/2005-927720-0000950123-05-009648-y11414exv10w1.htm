expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller has the full and unrestricted power and
authority, limited liability company and otherwise, to own, lease and operate the Assets, to carry
on its business as now conducted, and to enter into and perform the terms of this Agreement, the
agreements, and instructions referred to herein, and the transactions contemplated hereby and

shall have failed prior to the Closing Date to obtain consents to the transfer of any Consent
Required Contract, the terms of this Section shall govern the transfer of the benefits of each such
contract. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that at the Closing Sellers shall not transfer or cause to be
transferred to Buyer any Consent Required Contract the consent to which has not been obtained prior
to the Closing Date. With respect to each such unassigned Consent Required Contract, after the
Closing Date Sellers shall continue to deal with the other contracting party or parties to such
Consent Required Contract as the prime contracting party and shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of all required parties to the transfer of such Consent
Required Contract to Buyer, but Buyer shall be entitled to the benefits of such Consent Required
Contract accruing after the Closing Date to the extent that Sellers may provide Buyer with such
benefits without violating the terms of such Consent Required Contract. To the extent permitted
under such Consent Required Contract, Buyer agrees to perform at its sole expense all the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">indemnified party pursuant to this Article&nbsp;X, such indemnified party shall promptly pay over
to the indemnifying party the amount so recovered, up to but not in excess of the sum of (i)&nbsp;any
amount previously so paid by the indemnifying party to or on behalf of the indemnified party in
respect of such matters and (ii)&nbsp;any amount expended by the indemnifying party in pursuing or
defending any claim arising out of such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any matter
subject to indemnification hereunder the amount of Damages sustained by an indemnified party
exceeds the amount previously paid by the indemnifying party to or on behalf of the indemnified
party in respect of such matter, the indemnified party shall have the right to first retain to the
extent of such excess the amount subsequently recovered from a third party in respect of such
matter and the remaining portion of such amount recovered from a third party shall be paid to the
indemnifying party.

such payment, be subrogated to the rights of the indemnified party against any third party in
respect to the Damages to which the payment relates. Without limiting the generality of any other
provision hereof, each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party will duly execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect such subrogation rights.

under Section&nbsp;10.2 or 10.3 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under such
Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the failure so to
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any
indemnified party except to the extent the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such
action is prejudiced thereby. In case any such action shall be brought against an indemnified
party and it shall give notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the
indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of such action, the indemnified party shall have
the right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the defense thereof.
If the indemnifying party elects not to assume (or fails to assume) the defense of such action, the
indemnified party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action with counsel of its own
choice, at the expense of the indemnifying party. If the action is asserted against both the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and there is a conflict of interests which renders it
inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall be responsible for paying for separate counsel for the
indemnified party; provided, however, that if there is more than one indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall not be responsible for paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys
to represent the indemnified parties, regardless of the number of indemnified parties. If the
