of its remedies under the Loan Documents), and without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Lender hereunder, Lender shall have the right to acquire the Innisbrook Property from Borrower
(the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Purchase Option</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") for either of the following forms of consideration: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
payment by Lender to Borrower, in cash, of the Fair Market Value of the Innisbrook Property on the date of exercise of the Purchase Option (subject to Borrower's
obligation to pay the outstanding principal amount of the Loan and accrued interest, together with any other payments due and owing under this Agreement or the Loan Documents, including the Additional
Interest Amount); or </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation
of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, including any obligation to pay the Additional Interest Amount, and the issuance by Lender to Borrower of
the Purchase Price/Lender's Shares (as increased by any stock splits or stock dividends issued by GTA&nbsp;Inc. during the term of this Agreement and adjusted for any successor entity to GTA by way
of merger or otherwise based on the exchange rate at the time of such merger). </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Upon
notice of exercise by Lender of the Purchase Option, Borrower shall execute a special warranty deed, bill of sale, and such other documents and instruments as Lender reasonably requires, and
shall take all other actions reasonably necessary or desirable to convey good and marketable title to the Innisbrook Property to Lender, subject only to Permitted Exceptions. Borrower shall not remove
any Tangible Personal Property from the Property upon termination of the Agreement and any amounts remaining in the Capital Replacement Reserve shall be paid over to Lender. Borrower shall pay for an
owner's title insurance policy for Lender, in customary form, and shall pay for all transfer and recording taxes applicable to such purchase and sale. The purchase option granted to Lender herein
shall be memorialized and recorded in the Deed of Trust. Upon consummation of Lender's option to purchase the Innisbrook Property pursuant to this Article&nbsp;XI, Borrower shall vacate and
surrender the Innisbrook Property to Lender in the condition in which the Innisbrook Property was in on the Closing Date, except as repaired, rebuilt, restored, altered or added to as permitted or
required by the provisions of this Agreement and except for ordinary wear and tear (subject to the obligation of Borrower to maintain the Property in good order and repair during the Term). Lender
shall cooperate with Borrower to minimize any adverse tax impact to Borrower upon Lender's exercise of the Purchase Option, including, without limitation, the purchase of the stock of the entity
owning the Innisbrook Property; provided such cooperation shall be at no additional cost to Lender, shall not result in Lender
having a different tax basis in the Innisbrook Property, shall not subject Lender to additional liabilities, nor delay the conveyance of the Innisbrook Property to Lender. </FONT></P>
