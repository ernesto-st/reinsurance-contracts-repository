<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Dear Mark:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to inform you that, pursuant to action taken by the Compensation Committee (the
&#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of Directors of Delphi Financial Group, Inc. (&#147;Delphi&#148;) under Section&nbsp;5
of the 2003 Employee Long-Term Incentive and Share Award Plan, as amended (the &#147;Plan&#148;), you have
been granted options to purchase up to 225,000 shares of Delphi&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (the
&#147;Stock&#148;) at the price of $29.14 per share (the &#147;Options&#148;), which was the fair market value of the
Stock as of February&nbsp;15, 2008, the effective date of such grant, as determined under the Plan.
Such option grant is subject in all respects to the terms and conditions described herein. This
agreement, once countersigned by you, shall constitute an &#147;Award Agreement&#148; as defined in Section
2(c) of the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Options will become exercisable, in accordance with the procedures described herein, if
and to the extent that SIG Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, &#147;SIG&#148;)
meet the following financial performance goals, as measured and determined in accordance with the
provisions of Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;If SIG&#146;s aggregate Pre-Tax Operating Income (as such term is defined in Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto)
for the period consisting of Delphi&#146;s 2008, 2009 and 2010 fiscal years is at least $473,459,000,
135,000 Options shall become exercisable. Alternatively, if SIG&#146;s aggregate Pre-Tax Operating
Income for such period does not reach $473,459,000, but is greater than

interpolating between zero and 135,000 in relation to the point at which the Pre-Tax Operating
Income amount falls in the range between $431,681,000 and $473,459,000 and rounding the number
obtained to the nearest whole number. For example, if Pre-Tax Operating Income for such period
were exactly $452,570,000, 67,500 Options would become exercisable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;If SIG&#146;s aggregate Pre-Tax Operating Income for the period consisting of Delphi&#146;s 2008,
2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 fiscal years is at least $919,293,000, 225,000 Options, less the number
of Options, if any, as shall previously have become exercisable pursuant to the preceding clause
(a) (the &#147;Previously Vested Options&#148;), shall become exercisable. Alternatively, if SIG&#146;s aggregate
Pre-Tax Operating Income for such period does not reach $919,293,000, but is greater than
$796,211,000, a reduced number of the Options shall become exercisable, such number to be
determined by interpolating between zero and 225,000 in relation to the point at which the Pre-Tax
Operating Income amount falls in the range between $796,211,000 and $919,293,000, rounding the
number obtained to the nearest whole number, and subtracting from such number the number of the
Previously Vested Options. For example, if Pre-Tax Operating Income for such period was
$857,752,000, and the number of the Previously Vested Options was 50,000, 62,500 Options would
become exercisable. If, in such example, there were no Previously Vested Options, 112,500 Options
would become exercisable.

aggregate Pre-Tax Operating Income in an amount representing a compound average annualized growth
rate of at least ten percent (10%), as compared with the 2007 Pre-Tax Operating Income base amount

Performance Condition would relate to the period from January&nbsp;1, 2008 through March&nbsp;31, 2009, and

herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Option Agreement. It is intended that SIG&#146;s
Pre-Tax Operating Income will be adjusted, upward or downward, to eliminate the effect of the
following items: structured settlement transactions; new affiliated reinsurance arrangements;
asset transfers; Federal Home Loan Bank or other borrowing-related activities; affiliated or
related party transactions; and any other items, expenses or transactions implemented, initiated,
imposed or determined by Delphi, its affiliates or related parties. The determination of Pre-Tax
Operating Income for each year will be made by Delphi annually within 65&nbsp;days of the end of such
year. The items referenced in the preceding sentence shall be referred to collectively herein as

excluding, in all cases, realized investment gains and losses and before extraordinary gain or loss
and federal income tax expense, all as determined in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, as in effect as of January&nbsp;1, 2008 (&#147;GAAP&#148;). However, if
subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2008, any change to GAAP becomes effective which either the SIG
Optionholders (as such term is defined below), on one hand, or Delphi, on the other, believes
should be taken into account for purposes of calculating Pre-Tax Operating Income hereunder
(including, for example, a situation in which such change is anticipated to have a significant
impact on Delphi&#146;s reported results), Delphi and the SIG Optionholders will jointly discuss and
consider in good faith whether any amendments to this Exhibit&nbsp;A would be appropriate to take such
change into account, and jointly recommend to the Committee for adoption any amendments mutually
