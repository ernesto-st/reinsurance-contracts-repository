Holder shall take all appropriate steps to safeguard Confidential Information in Holder&#8217;s possession and to protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft.  Holder shall deliver to the Company upon Holder&#8217;s Termination of Relationship, or at any time the Company may request, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data (and copies thereof) relating to the Confidential Information or the business of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Asset Management Company or any of their respective Affiliates which Holder may then possess or have under his or her control.

Holder agrees that if Holder were to become employed by, or substantially involved in, the business of a competitor of the Protected Companies during the Restricted Period, it would be very difficult for Holder not to rely on or use the Protected Companies&#8217; trade secrets and confidential information.

During Holder&#8217;s period of service and for a period of twelve (12)  months after the date of Holder&#8217;s Termination of Relationship, Holder shall not directly or indirectly through any other Person (a) induce or attempt to induce any employee or independent contractor of the Protected Companies to leave the employ or service, as applicable, of the Protected Companies, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Protected Companies, on the one hand, and any employee or independent contractor thereof, on the other hand, or (b) hire any person who was an employee of the Protected Companies, in each case, until six (6) months after such individual&#8217;s employment relationship with the Protected Companies has been terminated.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:96px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">6.4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Non-Solicitation of Customers</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">.  During Holder&#8217;s period of service and for a period of twelve (12) months after the date of Holder&#8217;s Termination of Relationship, Holder shall not directly or indirectly through any other Person influence or attempt to influence customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors, lessors, joint venturers, ceding companies, associates, consultants, agents, or partners of the Protected Companies to divert their business away from the Protected Companies, and Holder will not otherwise interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the business relationships, contractual or otherwise, between the Protected Companies, on the one hand, and any of their customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, joint venturers, associates, officers, employees, consultants, managers, partners, members or investors, on the other hand.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:96px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">6.5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Understanding of Covenants</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">.  Holder represents and agrees that he or she (a) is familiar with and carefully considered the foregoing covenants set forth in this </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Section 6</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">&#32;(together, the &#8220;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Restrictive Covenants</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">&#8221;), (b) is fully aware of his or her obligations hereunder, (c) agrees to the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage, as applicable, of the Restrictive Covenants, (d) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are necessary to protect the Protected Companies&#8217; confidential and proprietary information, good will, stable workforce and customer relations, and (e) agrees that the Restrictive Covenants will continue in effect for the applicable periods set forth above in this </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Section 6</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">&#32;regardless of whether Holder is then entitled to receive severance pay or benefits from any of the Protected Companies.  Holder understands that the Restrictive Covenants may limit his or her ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business of the Protected Companies, but he or she nevertheless believes that he or she has received and will receive sufficient consideration and other benefits as an employee of or other service provider to the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder to clearly justify such restrictions which, in any event (given his or her education, skills and ability), Holder does not believe would prevent him or her from otherwise earning a living.  Holder agrees that the Restrictive Covenants do not confer a benefit upon the Protected Companies disproportionate to the detriment of Holder.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;"><br></font></div><div><br></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div></div><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;text-indent:96px;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">6.6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Enforcement</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">.  Holder agrees that Holder&#8217;s services are unique and that he or she has access to Confidential Information.  Accordingly, Holder agrees that a breach by Holder of any of the Restrictive Covenants would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Company that would be difficult or impossible to measure, and that damages to the Company for any such injury would therefore be an inadequate remedy for any such breach.  Therefore, Holder agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Section 6</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to and without limitation upon all other remedies the Company may have under this Agreement, at law or otherwise, to obtain specific performance, injunctive relief and/or other appropriate relief (without posting any bond or deposit) in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Section 6</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">, as the case may be, or require Holder to account for and pay over to the Company all compensation, profits, moneys, accruals, increments or other benefits derived from or received as a result of any transactions constituting a breach of this </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Section 6</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">, if and when final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is so entered against Holder.  Holder further agrees that the applicable period of time any Restrictive Covenant is in effect following the date of Holder&#8217;s Termination of Relationship, as determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;text-decoration:underline;">Section 6</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">, shall be extended by the same amount of time that Holder is in breach of any Restrictive Covenant.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:left;font-size:9pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div><br></div><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div>	</body>
