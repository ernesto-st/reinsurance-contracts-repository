                          CONVERSION TO CORPORATE FORM

          2.1. FORMATION. The parties hereto continue a limited partnership
formed on May 25, 2001 pursuant to the Act.

          2.2. NAME. The name of the Partnership shall be "XL Principal Partners
I, L.P." The General Partner is authorized to make any variations in the
Partnership's name which the General Partner may deem necessary or advisable,
PROVIDED (a) that such name shall contain the words "Limited Partnership" or the
letters "L.P." or the equivalent translation thereof and any other designation
required by applicable law and (b) that the General Partner shall notify the
Registrar of Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands of any such change of
name in accordance with the Act. All Partnership business shall be conducted in
such name of the Partnership.

          2.3. PRINCIPAL OFFICE. The Partnership shall maintain its principal
office at, and its affairs shall be conducted from, Bermuda or such place or
places as the General Partner may, with notice to the Limited Partners, decide.

          2.4. PURPOSE. The purpose of the Partnership is to (a) achieve
long-term capital appreciation for its investors through a portfolio of
investments, including without limitation, private equity, venture capital and
hedge funds; equity and equity-related securities of all types; investments in
debt securities, preferred shares and other financial instruments; and
securities issued by companies providing financial guarantee, insurance and
reinsurance contracts. These investments are referred to collectively as the
"Investments;" (b) to engage in any other business activities that may be lawful
in or from within the Cayman Islands and to engage in any other business or
activity that now or hereafter may be necessary, incidental, proper, advisable
or convenient to accomplish the foregoing purposes (including, without
limitation, obtaining financing) and that is not forbidden by the law of the
jurisdiction in which the Partnership engages in that business; and (c) to act
as manager or agent for, or consultant or adviser to the business of any
exempted undertaking, as that expression is defined in the Bermuda Overseas
Partnerships Act 1995.

          2.5. ORGANIZATIONAL CERTIFICATES AND OTHER FILINGS; LIMITATIONS ON
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. (a) The General Partner has executed and caused to be filed
with the Registrar of Exempted Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands a
registration statement pursuant to Section 9 of the Act containing information
required by the Act. The General Partner may cause the Partnership to qualify as
a foreign limited partnership (or a partnership in which the Limited Partner has
limited liability) in any other jurisdiction.

          (b) If requested by the General Partner, the Limited Partners shall
promptly execute all certificates and other documents consistent with the terms
of this Agreement necessary for the General Partner to accomplish all filing,
recording, publishing and other acts as may be


<PAGE>

                                                                               7

appropriate to comply with all requirements for (i) the formation and operation
of a limited partnership under the laws of the Cayman Islands, (ii) the
operation of the Partnership as an entity or partnership in which the Limited
Partners have limited liability, in all jurisdictions where the Partnership
proposes to operate and (iii) all other filings required to be made by the
Partnership.

          (c) The General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause the
Partnership to maintain the limited liability of the Limited Partners. The
General Partner shall cause the Partnership to be qualified or registered under
assumed or fictitious names or foreign limited partnership statutes or similar
laws in any jurisdiction in which the Partnership owns property or transacts
business to the extent such qualification or registration is necessary or, in
the judgment of the General Partner, advisable in order to protect the limited
liability of the Limited Partners or to permit the Partnership to lawfully own
property or transact business, and shall cause the Partnership not to own
property or transact business in any such jurisdiction until it is so qualified
or registered. The General Partner shall execute, file and publish all such
certificates, notices, statements or other instruments necessary to permit the
Partnership lawfully to own property and conduct business as a limited
partnership in all jurisdictions where the Partnership elects to own property or
transact business and to maintain the limited liability of the Limited Partners.

          2.6. TERM. The Partnership shall continue until the close of business
on December 31, 2027, or upon earlier termination by the General Partner. The
Partnership is also subject to termination upon the occurrence of certain
specific events as set forth in Section 10.1 hereof. Upon the dissolution of the
Partnership, its liabilities are to be paid in the order provided herein. The
General Partner shall cause Partnership assets to be sold in such manner as the
General Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine. The General Partner may,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, purchase from the Partnership any
Partnership investments upon which there are significant restrictions or for
which another purchaser willing to pay fair market value is not readily
obtainable. The fair market value of any such investment shall be determined in
good faith by the General Partner at the time of the transfer and shall be
deemed fair and reasonable and not a violation of the General Partner's
fiduciary duty to the Partnership, absent manifest error. Pending sale of
Partnership assets, the General Partner shall have the right to continue to
operate and otherwise to deal with Partnership assets. After the payment of the
debts and liabilities of the Partnership and the setting up of reasonable
reserves, the remaining proceeds of the liquidation shall be distributed to the
Partners in proportion to their capital accounts in the Partnership.

          2.7. REGISTERED OFFICE AND PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS. The address of
the Partnership's registered office in the Cayman Islands shall be at the
offices of Huntlaw Corporate Services Ltd., Huntlaw Building, P.O. Box 1350GT,
75 Fort Street, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, and the address of its principal
place of business shall be c/o XL Capital Ltd, XL House, One Bermudiana Road,
Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. Such registered office and principal place of business
may be changed by the General Partner with the prior written consent of the
Minister of Finance of Bermuda; PROVIDED that the General Partner and its
Affiliates shall notify the Limited Partners of such change within a reasonable
period of time thereafter; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the registered office shall
always be in the Cayman Islands. The Partnership may from time to

                                                                               8

time have such other place or places of business within or outside the Cayman
Islands as may be determined by the General Partner.

          2.8. FISCAL YEAR. The fiscal year ("Fiscal Year") of the Partnership
shall be the calendar year or, in the case of the first and last fiscal years of
the Partnership, the fraction thereof commencing on the Closing or ending on the
date on which the winding-up of the Partnership is completed, as the case may
be. The General Partner shall have the authority to change the ending date of
the Fiscal Year if the General Partner shall determine that such change is
necessary or appropriate; PROVIDED that the General Partner shall promptly give
notice of any such change to the Limited Partners.

          2.9. ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT STRUCTURE. (a) If the General Partner
determines in good faith that for legal, tax, regulatory or other reasons it is
in the best interests of some or all of the Partners that an Investment be made
through an alternative investment structure, the General Partner shall be
permitted to structure the making of all or any portion of such Investment
outside of the Partnership, by requiring any Partner or Partners to make such
Investment either directly (which shall not include a general partner interest
or other similar interest) or indirectly through a partnership or other vehicle
(other than the Partnership) that will invest on a parallel basis (and on
effectively the same economic terms) with or in lieu of the Partnership, as the
case may be (any such structure or vehicle, an "Alternative Investment
Vehicle"). The Partners investing through such Alternative Investment Vehicle
shall be required to make capital contributions to such Alternative Investment
Vehicle to the same extent, for the same purposes and on the same terms and
conditions as Partners are required to make Capital Contributions to the
Partnership, and such capital contributions shall reduce the Unpaid Capital
Commitments of the Limited Partners to the same extent as if Capital
Contributions were made to the Partnership with respect thereto. Each Partner
shall have the same economic interest in all material respects in Investments
made pursuant to this Section 2.9 as such Partner would have if such Investment
had been made solely by the Partnership, and the other terms of such Alternative
Investment Vehicle shall be substantially identical in all material respects to
those of the Partnership, to the maximum extent applicable; PROVIDED that such
Alternative Investment Vehicle (or the entity in which such Alternative
Investment Vehicle invests) shall provide for the limited liability of the
Limited Partners as a matter of the organizational documents of such Alternative
Investment Vehicle (or the entity in which such Alternative Investment Vehicle
invests) and as a matter of local law; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the General
Partner or an Affiliate thereof will serve as the general partner or in some
other similar fiduciary capacity with respect to such Alternative Investment
Vehicle.

          (b) If the Partnership makes an Investment through an Alternative
Investment Vehicle the General Partner may make a distribution to Limited
Partners in order to permit them to fund the Alternative Investment Vehicle.

or propose to invest in the same types of investments as the Partnership.

                                LIMITED PARTNERS

          4.1. INITIAL LIMITED PARTNER. (a) The Initial Limited Partner has
become such only for the purpose of organizing the Partnership and has
contributed $10.00 to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution. Upon the
admission of one or more Limited Partners to the Partnership at the Closing, the
Initial Limited Partner shall (i) receive a return of any capital contribution
made by it in such capacity to the Partnership, (ii) withdraw as the Initial
Limited Partner of the Partnership and (iii) have no further right, interest or
obligation of any kind whatsoever as a Partner in the Partnership.

          (b) Unless the context otherwise specifically requires, references in
this Agreement to the Limited Partners, their capital and their rights and
obligations shall not be references to the Initial Limited Partner.

          4.2. ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNERS. (a) The General Partner is
authorized to admit Limited Partners to the Partnership pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and upon execution and delivery by each Limited Partner of a
subscription agreement and such other documents as the General Partner deems
necessary or advisable, each in form satisfactory to the General Partner,
relating to the Units or any other limited partnership interests in the
Partnership. The manner of the offering of the Units or such other limited
partnership interests, the terms and conditions under which subscriptions for
such Units or other limited partnership interests shall be accepted, and the
manner of and conditions to the sale of Units or other limited partnership
interests to subscribers therefor shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
various subscription agreements between the Partnership and each Limited
Partner, and subject to any provisions of any of them. A person shall be
admitted as a Limited Partner upon acceptance of the subscription agreement by
or on behalf of the Partnership and on the day his or her admission is reflected
on the Register of the Partnership. Upon such admission the Limited Partner
shall become a party to and be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The admission of additional Limited Partners hereunder shall not
cause the dissolution of the Partnership.

          (b) The General Partner shall make such other adjustment to the

Partners existing prior to the admission of such new Limited Partner including
such amendments as are necessary to reflect the economic arrangements of the
Partners including the manner in which distributions are shared among the
Partners.

business in the Partnership's name or have the power to sign documents for or
otherwise bind the Partnership. Limited Partners shall not participate in any
investment decisions made on behalf of the Partnership.

                    and make commitments on behalf of the Partnership and, in
                    general, to do and perform everything which may be
                    necessary, advisable, suitable or proper for the conduct of
                    the Partnership's business and for the carrying out of the
                    purposes and objects herein before enumerated, including the
                    delegation to any person or persons of such functions and
                    authority as the General Partner may determine; and

          (vii)     to employ attorneys and accountants to represent and audit
                    the books of the Partnership, which attorneys and
                    accountants may also serve as counsel and auditors to the
                    General Partner and any of its Affiliates.

          (b) Any person not a party to this Agreement dealing with the
Partnership shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority
of any officer or director of the General Partner to bind the Partnership in all
respects, and to execute agreements, instruments and other writings on behalf of
and in the name of the Partnership.

          5.2. RESTRICTIONS ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. Without the
approval of a majority in interest of the Limited Partners, the General Partner
shall not have the authority to alter the purpose of the Partnership.

          5.3. DUTIES. (a) Other than with respect to temporary investments, and
after setting aside suitable reserves, the General Partner shall use its
reasonable efforts to invest the Capital Contributions of the Partners and
reinvest the revenues of the Partnership in accordance with the purposes of the
Partnership, monitor the investments of the Partnership and manage the related
affairs of the Partnership.

          (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the General Partner
shall take all action that may be necessary or appropriate for the continuation
of the Partnership's valid existence as a limited partnership under the laws of
the Cayman Islands, and for the acquisition, holding and disposition, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and applicable laws and
regulations, of the investments of the Partnership.

          (c) The General Partner shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
shall file on or before the due date (or any extension thereof) any United
States federal, state or local tax returns required to be filed by the
Partnership. The General Partner shall cause the Partnership to pay, from
Partnership funds, any taxes payable by the Partnership.

          (d) The General Partner shall be under a fiduciary duty and obligation
to conduct the affairs of the Partnership in the best interests of the
Partnership, including the safekeeping and


<PAGE>

                                                                              13

use of all Partnership funds and assets (whether or not in the immediate
possession or control of the General Partner) for the benefit of the
Partnership. The General Partner shall at all times act with integrity and good
faith and exercise due diligence in all activities relating to the conduct of
the business of the Partnership and in resolving conflicts of interest.

          (e) The General Partner may delegate or assign any action that may be
or is required to be taken by the General Partner to any third party, including
without limitation, an Affiliate of the General Partner.

          5.4. INVESTMENT COMMITTEE. All investment decisions by the General
Partner shall be subject to the approval of a committee consisting of three to
four members (the "Investment Committee"), two of whom will be outside directors
of an Affiliate of the XL Group.

          5.5. LIABILITY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. Except as may be required by
the Act, the General Partner shall not be required to contribute to the capital
of the Partnership any funds in excess of 4.0 times the Limited Partners'
aggregate Capital Contributions (the "General Partner's Capital Contribution").
Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall have any personal
liability for the return or repayment of the Capital Contributions of any
Limited Partner.

          5.6. EXCULPATION, INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. Neither the
General Partner, any of its officers, directors, representatives or agents, nor
any member of the Investment Committee, nor any partners or principals of the XL
Group (including any directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates
thereof) nor any person who controls the General Partner or the XL Group (a
"control person") within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, shall be liable to the Partnership or the Limited Partners for
any act or failure to act relating in any way to the Partnership, its assets,
business or affairs so long as such act or failure to act does not (i) have a
material adverse effect on the Partnership and (ii) constitute such person's
willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the
duties involved in the conduct of the Partnership or such person's office. The
General Partner and its officers, directors, agents, representatives, and
members of the Investment Committee, and any partners or principals of the XL
Group (including any directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates
thereof) and control persons shall be indemnified by the Partnership to the
fullest extent permitted by law for any and all losses, claims, damages and
expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with any claim, action or
demand against the General Partner, the Partnership or any such indemnified
person relating to the Partnership, its assets, business or affairs (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses and any amounts paid in
settlement or compromise of any such claim, action or demand); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the foregoing indemnification shall not apply if a court of
competent jurisdiction makes a final decision that such claim, action or demand
resulted directly from such indemnified person's willful misconduct, bad faith,
gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of
the Partnership or such person's office.

          5.7. GENERAL PARTNER LOANS. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
3.4, in the event that the Partnership at any time lacks sufficient funds to
meet its financial obligations, the General Partner shall have the right to, but
shall not be required to, lend money to the Partnership on terms, including
interest rates, that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership (but in no event

                                                                              14

less than the rate required under United States tax law to avoid compensation
income to the Limited Partners) without any approval of the Limited Partners.
The General Partner may execute written agreements governing any such loans on
behalf of the Partnership.

                                   ARTICLE 6

                        CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; NO FURTHER
           CONTRIBUTIONS REQUIRED; INTEREST; ACCOUNTING AND VALUATION

          6.1. CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. (a) Subscriptions for Units shall be
accepted or rejected by the General Partner as it determines in its sole
discretion. Each Unit represents a capital commitment of $25,000. The minimum
Capital Contribution of each Limited Partner is one Unit ($25,000), or such
fractional Unit as permitted in the General Partner's sole discretion.
Additional whole Units may be purchased up to a maximum Capital Contribution as
determined on a case-by-case basis by the General Partner in its sole
discretion. The Initial Payment is due and payable upon execution and delivery
of the related subscription agreement unless the General Partner shall specify
one or more other dates on which the Initial Payment shall be due. The General
Partner may invest such Capital Contributions in temporary investments until
needed to fund one or more Partnership investments. Any Capital Contributions
made to the Partnership by a Limited Partner must be paid in cash. The
obligation of a Limited Partner to pay its Initial Payment Amount in full shall
be limited by the provisions of this Section 6.1 and Section 9.4. The General
Partner may decide not to make or participate in any further investments at any
time in its sole discretion.

          (b) The remaining portion of each Limited Partner's Commitment shall
be due upon a call date to be determined in the sole discretion of the General
Partner. The Fund shall provide each Limited Partner with a written notice at
least 20 days prior to the date of draw down (each, a "Capital Draw"); provided
that the General Partner may not call more than 25% of a Limited Partner's
Commitment (in addition to the Initial Payment) prior to the date designated by
XL Capital for the payment of annual bonuses in 2002. Any Capital Contributions
made to the Fund by a Limited Partner must be paid in cash.

          (c) Pending the making of investments for which the Partnership
requires capital, payments for the purchase price of each Limited Partner's
Units may be invested in temporary investments as the General Partner
determines. Amounts invested in temporary investments may not be subject to
redemption by Limited Partners, although income earned from temporary
investments may be distributed to the Limited Partners in the General Partner's
sole discretion. The General Partner shall dispose of temporary investments from
time to time as needed to fund specific Partnership investments or otherwise
fund Partnership expenses. Amounts held at the end of the Investment Period that
have not been used for Partnership purposes and which the Partnership has not
allocated for future use shall be distributed to the Limited Partners in
proportion to their allocable share of amounts originally contributed to the
Partnership.

          (d) The General Partner shall contribute to the capital of the
Partnership an amount equal to 4.0 times the aggregate amount contributed by the
Limited Partners. The General Partner shall

                                                                              15

make its Capital Contributions at the time the Partnership funds its investments
or otherwise to fund Partnership expenses. The General Partner's Capital
Contribution shall receive the benefit of a preferred return (the "Fixed
Return"), at the rate of 10% per annum.

          (e) METHOD OF FUNDING; NO COMPENSATION OR LOANS. Capital Contributions
shall be made by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds or such
other method as may be acceptable to the General Partner, to the account
specified in the related Payment Notice. Other than as set forth in this Section
6.4, no Partner shall be entitled to any interest or compensation by reason of
its Capital Contributions or by reason of serving as a Partner. No Partner shall
be required to lend any funds to the Partnership; PROVIDED that the General
Partner may in its sole discretion make loans to the Partnership on arms'-length
terms based on the Reference Rate or the cost of borrowing such funds by XL
Capital.

          (f) Upon the termination of the Commitment Period, a Limited Partner
will not be required to make any further Capital Contributions to the
Partnership, except to the extent necessary to (i) cover certain expenses borne
by the Partnership and (ii) make follow-on Investments in existing Investments
of the Partnership in an aggregate amount of up to 25% of the Partnership's
aggregate capital commitments from the Partners. In no event will a Limited
Partner be required to fund at any time an amount in excess of his or her
undrawn capital commitment at such time.

          6.2. SUBSEQUENT CLOSINGS. The General Partner may, in its sole
discretion, admit additional Limited Partners or permit any existing Limited
Partner to increase its Capital Contribution at one or more subsequent closings
("Subsequent Closings"), provided that no Subsequent Closing shall occur after
the six-month anniversary of the Closing. No additional Limited Partner shall be
admitted to the Partnership unless such Limited Partner has executed a
subscription agreement in the form provided to it by the General Partner (and
which subscription agreement has been accepted by the General Partner) and the
conditions set forth in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 are satisfied (with such
conditions being interpreted as applying to the admission of an additional
Limited Partner rather than an assignment or transfer of an interest in the
Partnership). Each Limited Partner that is admitted or increases its Capital
Contribution at a Subsequent Closing shall also make an additional contribution
and/or payment, if any, determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion
that represents the increase in the value of investments held by the
Partnership, if any, plus an additional amount thereon at the rate calculated by
the General Partner from the date of the initial closing. Limited Partners who
are admitted to the Partnership after the Closing or who increase their
commitments will be treated generally as if such subscriptions had been accepted
at the date of the first closing.

          6.3. FURTHER CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. No Limited Partner shall be
required to purchase additional Units or make any Capital Contribution to the
Partnership in excess of such Limited Partner's Unpaid Capital Commitment. After
all Capital Contributions have been made and all contributions, including
required General Partner contributions, have been invested by the Partnership,
if the General Partner determines it to be in the best interests of the
Partnership, the Partnership may, subject to subsection 4.2(b), offer existing
or new Limited Partners the opportunity to make additional contributions to the
Partnership's capital on a PRO RATA basis, as determined by the General Partner.

                                                                              16

          6.4. DEFAULTING LIMITED PARTNER. (a) If any Limited Partner fails to
make, when due, any portion of the Capital Contribution required to be
contributed by such Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement or such Limited
Partner's Subscription Agreement or to make any other payment required to be
made by such Limited Partner hereunder or thereunder when required to be made,
then the General Partner may provide written notice of such failure to such
Limited Partner. If such Limited Partner fails to make such Capital Contribution
or other payment within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice,
then, (i) such Limited Partner shall be deemed a "Defaulting Limited Partner"
and (ii) the following Sections 6.4(b) through (e) shall apply; PROVIDED that
the General Partner in its sole discretion may choose not to designate a Limited
Partner as a Defaulting Limited Partner and may agree to waive or permit the
cure of any default by a Defaulting Limited Partner, subject to such conditions
as the General Partner and the Defaulting Limited Partner may agree on.

          (b) A Defaulting Limited Partner shall forfeit to the General Partner,
as recompense for damages suffered, as follows: (i) with respect to such Limited
Partner's Pro Rata Share and related distributions, the General Partner shall
assess a 25% reduction, (ii) with respect to such Limited Partner's interest in
the vested portion of the Additional Share, the General Partner shall assess a
25% reduction and (iii) the General Partner shall cause such Defaulting Limited
Partner to be excluded from any vote of the Limited Partners. Any proceeds
forfeited by the Defaulting Limited Partner pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall be distributed to the General Partner.

          (c) The General Partner may, in its sole discretion cancel such
Defaulting Limited Partner's right to make further Capital Contributions and
allocate such right to the General Partner or one of its Affiliates, and the
Defaulting Limited Partner shall not be permitted to make any further Capital
Contributions to the Partnership in the event of such cancellation.

          (d) No right, power or remedy conferred upon the General Partner in
this Section 6.4 shall be exclusive, and each such right, power or remedy shall
be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power or remedy whether
conferred in this Section 6.4 or now or hereafter available at law or in equity
or by statute or otherwise. No course of dealing between the General Partner and
any Defaulting Limited Partner and no delay in exercising any right, power or
remedy conferred in this Section 6.4 or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or by statute or otherwise shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
prejudice any such right, power or remedy.

          (e) The powers conferred upon the General Partner in this Article VI
shall not limit any actions available at law or in equity or by statute that the
General Partner may undertake against a Defaulting Limited Partner. Each Limited
Partner acknowledges by its execution of a Subscription Agreement that it has
been admitted to the Partnership in reliance upon the terms of this Agreement,
that the General Partner may have no adequate remedy at law for a breach hereof
and that damages resulting from a breach hereof may be impossible to ascertain
at the time hereof or of such breach.

          6.5. INTEREST. No Limited Partner shall receive interest on such
Limited Partner's Capital Contributions.

                                                                              17

          6.6. TAXABLE YEARS. The taxable year of the Partnership shall be the
calendar year unless otherwise required under the Code. Subject to such
requirements, the General Partner shall have the authority to change the ending
date of the tax year if the General Partner shall determine that such change is
necessary or appropriate; PROVIDED that the General Partner shall promptly give
notice of any such change to the Limited Partners.

                                   ARTICLE 7

                                  TAX ADVANCES

          7.1. TAX ADVANCES. To the extent the General Partner reasonably
determines that the Partnership is required by law to withhold or to make tax
payments on behalf of or with respect to any Partner ("Tax Advances"), the
General Partner may withhold such amounts and make such tax payments as so
required. All Tax Advances (together with interest thereon at the Reference Rate
if such Tax Advance took the form of a tax payment rather than withholding) made
on behalf of a Partner shall, at the option of the General Partner, (i) be paid
promptly to the Partnership by the Partner on whose behalf such Tax Advances
were made or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next
succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made to
such Partner or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by
so reducing the proceeds of liquidation otherwise payable to such Partner.
Whenever the General Partner selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding
sentence for repayment of a Tax Advance by a Partner, for all other purposes of
this Agreement such Partner shall be treated as having received all
distributions (whether before or upon liquidation) unreduced by the amount of
such Tax Advance. Each Partner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Partnership and the other Partners from and against any liability (including,
without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to tax,
interest or failure to withhold taxes) with respect to income attributable to or
distributions or other payments to such Partner.

                                   ARTICLE 8

                            DISTRIBUTIONS; WITHDRAWAL

          8.1. GENERAL PARTNER DISCRETION. Distributions may be made in cash or
in kind in the General Partner's sole discretion. The General Partner may in its
sole discretion offer Limited Partners the right to elect whether to receive
cash or in kind distributions in connection with any distribution and, following
any such election, may (but shall not be required to) make a distribution to
some Limited Partners in cash and to others in kind. The General Partner shall
have no obligation to make cash or non-cash distributions to the Limited
Partners prior to termination of the Partnership, and may invest the earnings on
and proceeds of any of the Partnership's investments in temporary investments in
its sole discretion. The General Partner in its sole discretion shall determine
the aggregate amount of and payment dates for any cash and non-cash
distributions to Partners after establishing such reasonable reserves as the
General


<PAGE>

                                                                              18

Partner deems appropriate in its sole discretion for working capital,
contingencies or other items and for the satisfaction of liabilities (including,
without limitation, contingent liabilities and the Fixed Return) as they come
due or may come due.

          8.2. DISTRIBUTIONS. (a) Distributions from the Partnership generally
shall be made in the following order and priority:

          (i)       first, 100% to the General Partner until the amount received
                    by the General Partner is equal to the General Partner's
                    Fixed Return;

          (ii)      second, 100% to the General Partner until the General
                    Partner has received an amount from that distribution (not
                    including the amount received in (i) above) equal to the
                    Capital Contributions made by the General Partner;

          (iii)     third, 100% to the Limited Partners until the Limited
                    Partners have received an amount equal to the Limited
                    Partners' Capital Contributions; and

          (iv)      thereafter, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
                    General Partner.

Provided that for the avoidance of doubt nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as giving a Limited Partner a direct interest in the assets of the
Partnership or any particular asset of the Partnership.

          (b) Distributions to Limited Partners shall be apportioned among each
Limited Partner based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the Capital
Contributions by such Limited Partner (or his or her predecessor in interest)
and the denominator of which is the aggregate Capital Contributions of all
Limited Partners.

          (c) Notwithstanding Section 8.2(a), amounts otherwise distributable to
the Partners shall be paid instead to the Partners (other than any Defaulting
Limited Partners, regardless of their tax status) such that in a fiscal year
each Partner has received an amount equal to 40% of the amount of taxable income
that would be allocated to such Partner if the Partnership were treated as a
flow-through entity for tax purposes; PROVIDED that the General Partner may, at
its sole discretion, vary the amounts distributed pursuant to this Section
8.2(c); PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the timing of any distribution, pursuant to this
Section 8.2(c) shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion. The amount distributable to any Partner pursuant to any clause of
Section 8.2 shall be reduced by the amount distributed to such Partner pursuant
to this Section 8.2(c) and the amount so distributed under this Section 8.2(c)
shall be deemed to have been distributed to the extent of such reduction
pursuant to such clause of Section 8.2 for purposes of making the calculations
required by Sections 8.2.

          (d) As provided further in Section 9.4(a), distributions which would
otherwise be made to a Limited Partner pursuant to the foregoing may instead be
made to the General Partner with respect to the Unvested Interest of such
Limited Partner whose employment with a member of the XL Group has terminated
other than due to such Limited Partner's death or Disability.

          8.3. NON-CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. Whenever possible non-cash distributions,
including distributions under Sections 10.3(a) and (b), shall be made PRO RATA
among the Partners in accordance with the terms of Section 8.2. The value of any
non-cash assets that are distributed shall be determined by the General Partner
in accordance with Section 11.4 hereof.

          8.4. WITHHOLDING. The Partnership shall withhold from any amounts
otherwise distributable to any Partner the amounts required by law to be
withheld for income tax or other purposes. Any amounts so withheld and any taxes
paid or withheld with respect to the income of the Partnership (or any entity in
which it invests including the Investment Company) shall be treated as having
been distributed to the Partners in respect of which such payments were made (as
reasonably determined by the General Partner) for all purposes of this
Agreement.

          8.5. WITHDRAWAL. No Partner shall have the right to withdraw such
Partner's Capital Contribution or any part thereof from the Partnership or to
receive a return of such Partner's Capital Contribution or any part thereof
except upon termination and dissolution of the Partnership, except as may be
permitted by the General Partner in its sole discretion.

          8.6. REQUIRED WITHDRAWAL. (a) A Limited Partner may be required to
withdraw from the Partnership if the General Partner determines, in its sole
discretion, that such withdrawal is necessary or advisable because (i) by virtue
of that Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership, the Partnership is
reasonably likely to be subject to any reporting requirement under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the Limited Partner is no
longer employed by a member of the XL Group or, in the case of Immediate Family
Members, is no longer an Immediate Family Member of an employee of the XL Group
or (iii) by virtue of that Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership, the
Partnership is likely to experience a significant delay, extraordinary expense
or other material adverse effect on the Partnership or any of its Affiliates or
any of its investments or prospective investments.

          (b) Withdrawals pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall be effected by the
Partnership's purchase of the Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership at a
price equal to the fair market value of such interests as determined from time
to time by the General Partner in its sole discretion.

          9.1. RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ON TRANSFERS OF UNITS. (a) No direct
or indirect sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, creation of a security
interest in, or encumbrance on, or other disposition by a Limited Partner of all
or any portion of such Limited Partner's Units or any economic interest therein
(including without limitation by means of any participation or swap transaction
(each, a "Transfer")) shall be made except, with the prior written consent of
the General Partner (which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the
General Partner), and then only to Immediate Family Members of the transferor
Limited Partner, trusts or to other


<PAGE>

                                                                              20

investment vehicles established for the benefit of the Limited Partner or his or
her Immediately Family Members or to the General Partner. The General Partner
may not transfer any of its interest in the Partnership.

          (b) Any Transfer otherwise permitted under this Article 9 may only be
made if:

          (i)       such transfer would not violate the Securities Act or any
                    state securities or "Blue Sky" or other securities laws
                    applicable to the Partnership or the interest to be
                    transferred; and

          (ii)      such transfer would not cause the Partnership to become
                    subject to the Investment Company Act.

          (c) The General Partner, each Limited Partner, the Partnership and
their respective officers, directors, agents and control persons shall be
indemnified by a Limited Partner (the "Transferring Limited Partner") to the
fullest extent permitted by law for any and all losses, claims, damages and
expenses arising out of or reasonably incurred in connection with any claim,
action or demand against the General Partner, the Partnership or any such
indemnified person relating to the Partnership, its properties, business or
affairs (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses and any
amounts paid in settlement or compromise of any such claim, action or demand)
against expenses for which the Partnership, the General Partner or such other
person has not otherwise been reimbursed (including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by them
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and arising out of, relating
to, or in connection with, any Transfer of all or any portion of such
Transferring Limited Partner's Units, or in connection with the admission of a
substituted Limited Partner to the Partnership; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
foregoing indemnification shall not apply if a court of competent jurisdiction
makes a final decision that such claim, action or demand resulted primarily from
such indemnified person's willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the Partnership or
such person's office.

          (d) Subject to Section 6.1 and Section 9.4, no Unit may be subdivided
into fractional Units.

          9.2. ASSIGNEES. (a) The Partnership shall not recognize for any
purpose any purported Transfer of all or any portion of the Units of a Limited
Partner unless the provisions of Section 9.1 shall have been complied with and
there shall have been filed with the Partnership a Transfer Application, in form
satisfactory to the General Partner, executed and acknowledged by both the
seller, transferor or assignor and the purchaser, transferee or assignee and
such Transfer Application contains the acceptance by the purchaser, transferee
or assignee of all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, represents
that such Transfer was made in accordance with all applicable laws and
regulations and contains the purchaser's, transferee's or assignee's power of
attorney identical to that provided in Section 12.1 and, in addition, appoints
the General Partner his or her attorney-in-fact to execute this Agreement on
behalf of such purchaser, transferee or assignee. Any Transfer shall be
recognized by the Partnership as effective as of the date on which such Transfer
Application is filed with the Partnership.

                                                                              21

          (b) Any Limited Partner who shall assign all of his or her Units shall
not cease to be a Limited Partner unless and until a substituted Limited Partner
is admitted in his or her stead.

          (c) A person who is the assignee of all or any portion of the Units of
a Limited Partner, but does not become a substituted Limited Partner and desires
to make a further assignment of such Units, shall be subject to all the
provisions of this Article 9 to the same extent and in the same manner as any
Limited Partner desiring to effect a Transfer of his or her Units.

          9.3. SUBSTITUTED LIMITED PARTNERS. (a) No Limited Partner shall have
the right to substitute a purchaser, assignee, transferee, donee, heir, legatee,
distributee or other recipient of all or any portion of such Limited Partner's
Units as a Limited Partner in his or her place. Any such purchaser, assignee,
transferee, donee, heir, legatee, distributee or other recipient of Units shall
be admitted to the Partnership as a substituted Limited Partner only with the
consent of the General Partner, which consent shall be granted or withheld in
the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner and may be arbitrarily
withheld, and executed by all necessary parties and recorded, as and to the
extent required by law, in the proper records of each jurisdiction in which such
recordation is necessary to qualify the Partnership to conduct business or to
preserve the limited liability of the Limited Partners. The Limited Partners
hereby consent to the admission of a substituted Limited Partner whose admission
has been consented to by the General Partner. Any such consent by the General
Partner and the Limited Partners may be evidenced by the execution by the
General Partner of an amendment to this Agreement on its behalf and on behalf of
all Limited Partners evidencing the admission of such person as a Limited
Partner and the making of any filing required by law.

          (b) To the extent required by law, the General Partner shall file an
amended certificate of limited partnership with the appropriate authorities of
each jurisdiction in which the Partnership transacts business for the purpose of
adding as substituted Limited Partners all assignees of Units previously
approved by the General Partner for admission as substituted Limited Partners
and deleting any person who is no longer a Limited Partner or reflecting
accurately Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or to receive any
interest thereon.

          (c) No person shall become a substituted Limited Partner until such
person shall have delivered a Transfer Application as provided in Section 9.2(a)
and become a party to this Agreement. For the purpose of allocating profits,
losses and distributable cash, a person shall be treated as having become, and
as appearing in the records of the Partnership as, a Limited Partner on such
date as the Transfer to such person was recognized by the Partnership pursuant
to Section 9.2(a).

          9.4. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, DEATH OR DISABILITY OF LIMITED
PARTNER. (a) GENERALLY. If a Limited Partner's employment with a member of the
XL Group is terminated for any reason (other than termination of employment for
Cause or due to such Limited Partner's death or Disability), then the General
Partner shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion by written
notice sent by certified mail (or its equivalent) or via overnight courier to
such Limited Partner (or his or her Representative) within 30 days following
such termination of employment, to allocate and distribute profits and losses
that are realized after the date of termination in respect of the unvested
portion of such Limited Partner's interest in the

Partnership (the "Unvested Interest"), including distributions pursuant to
Article 8, to the General Partner. Vested Interest shall be determined according
to the schedule set forth below (the "Vesting Schedule"). The General Partner
shall conclusively determine in its sole and absolute discretion the closing
date for purposes of the Vesting Schedule.

</TABLE>


          The Limited Partner whose employment has been terminated shall
continue to receive an allocation and distribution of profits and losses on his
or her Units equal to the aggregate of (i) such Limited Partner's Pro Rata Share
and (ii) the vested portion of such Limited Partner's Additional Share of such
profits and losses as of the termination date. In such event of termination, the
Limited Partner shall not be required to return to the Partnership any cash or
assets that were distributed prior to the date of termination.

          (b) TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Upon a Limited Partner's termination of
employment by the XL Group for Cause, the General Partner shall have the right,
exercisable in its sole discretion, to purchase such Limited Partner's Units
including (i) such Limited Partner's Pro Rata Share and (ii) the vested portion
of such Limited Partner's Additional Share of Units at the lower of their cost
price or fair market value as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion.

          (c) TERMINATION DUE TO DEATH OR DISABILITY. Upon a Termination due to
death or Disability, a Limited Partner's interest in the Additional Share shall
immediately vest in full. Such departed Limited Partner shall therefore be
entitled to share fully in distributions and allocations of Partnership profits
and losses equal to the aggregate of (i) such Limited Partner's Pro Rata Share
and (ii) the full amount of such Limited Partner's Additional Share.

          (d) If a Limited Partner's employment with any member of the XL Group
is terminated for any reason (including death), the Partnership shall have the
right to require that Limited Partner to withdraw from the Partnership in
accordance with Section 8.6(a). Upon such withdrawal, the Partnership shall
purchase the Limited Partner's Units in accordance with Section 8.6(b).

                    that his or her capital commitments represent of the total
                    capital commitments to the Partnership;

          (ii)      A Limited Partner's "Additional Share" of profits is such
                    Limited Partner's share in excess of the Pro Rata Share and
                    includes such Limited Partner's pro rata share of the
                    profits on the General Partner's Commitment.

          (iii)     A "Limited Partner" for purposes of reference to employment
                    shall be the individual employee of the XL Group to whom a
                    Limited Partner Interest was originally offered,
                    notwithstanding any subscription by, or transfer to, a
                    Immediate Family Member or other Person in accordance with
                    this Agreement at the request of such individual employee of
                    the XL Group.

          9.5. DISPOSITION OF GENERAL PARTNER'S INTEREST. The General Partner

          10.1. EVENTS CAUSING DISSOLUTION. The Partnership shall be dissolved
upon the expiration of its term as set forth in Section 2.6 hereof, or sooner
upon the happening of any of the following events (each an "Event of
Dissolution"):

          (a) the resignation, withdrawal, dissolution, bankruptcy commencement
of liquidation proceedings or insolvency of the General Partner or the
occurrence of any other event that causes the General Partner to cease to be a
general partner of the Partnership under the Act; PROVIDED that the Partnership
shall not be dissolved or required to be wound up upon the happening of such
event if at the time of such event there is at least one remaining general
partner of the Partnership and such remaining general partner carries on the
business of the Partnership or within 90 days after such event, all remaining
Partners agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the
appointment, effective as of the date of such event, of one or more additional
general partners; or

          (b) the conversion of the Partnership to corporate form pursuant to
Section 2.6 hereof. Upon dissolution, the General Partner shall file a notice of
dissolution with the Registrar of Exempted Limited Partnership in accordance
with the Act. The Partnership shall not be dissolved until the assets of the
Partnership have been distributed as provided in Section 11.2, and the notice of
dissolution has been filed by the General Partner as aforesaid.

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

          10.2. WINDING UP. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Dissolution, the
Partnership shall be wound up and liquidated The General Partner or, if there is
no general partner or following an Event of Dissolution, a liquidator appointed
by XL Capital, shall proceed with the Dissolution Sale and the Final
Distribution. In the Dissolution Sale, the General Partner or such liquidator
shall use its best efforts to reduce to cash and cash equivalent items such
assets of the Partnership as the General Partner or such liquidator shall deem
it advisable to sell, subject to obtaining fair value for such assets and any
tax or other legal considerations (including legal restrictions on the ability
of a Limited Partner to hold any assets to be distributed in kind).

          10.3. FINAL DISTRIBUTION. After the Dissolution Sale, the proceeds
thereof and the other assets of the Partnership shall be distributed in one or
more installments in the following order of priority:

          (a) to satisfy all creditors of the Partnership, including the payment
of the expenses of the winding-up, liquidation and dissolution of the
Partnership and in accordance with the terms agreed among them and otherwise on
a pro rata basis, Partners who are creditors (other than with respect to
distributions owing to them or to former Partners hereunder) either by the
payment thereof or the making of reasonable provision therefor, which shall
include establishing reserves, in amounts determined by the General Partner or
such liquidator, which the General Partner or such liquidator may deem necessary
to meet any other obligations or liabilities (whether contingent, unforeseen or
otherwise) of the Partnership other than to the Partners or former partners in
respect of distributions owing to them hereunder, which reserves may be paid
over by the General Partner or such liquidator to any attorney at law or other
acceptable party, as escrow agent, to be held for disbursement in payment of any
such liabilities or obligations. At the expiration of such period as shall be
deemed advisable by the General Partner or such liquidator, any balance shall be
distributed in accordance with this Section 10.3; and

          (b) The remaining proceeds, if any, plus any remaining assets of the
Partnership, shall be applied and distributed to the Partners in the same manner
as distributions under Section 8.2 . The General Partner or such liquidator
shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell the assets of the Partnership and
distribute the proceeds therefrom in cash to the Partners. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if assets other than cash are to be distributed, such distribution
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 8.2. To the extent deemed
desirable by the General Partner or such liquidator, distributions may be made
into a liquidating trust or other appropriate entity, and reserves may be
established for contingencies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that the time during which
distributions may be withheld by such trust or other entity may not extend
beyond the term of the Partnership pursuant to Section 2.6 without the consent
of a majority in interest of the Limited Partners, unless such distribution
would be illegal. If a Limited Partner shall, upon the advice of counsel,
determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that any distribution in kind of
an asset would cause such Limited Partner to be in violation of any law,
regulation or order, such Limited Partner and the General Partner or the
liquidator shall each use its best efforts to make alternative arrangements for
the sale or transfer into an escrow account of any such distribution on mutually
agreeable terms.

General Partner and shall be available for examination there by any Limited
Partner or his or her duly authorized Representatives at any and all reasonable
times for any purpose reasonably related to the Limited Partner's interest as a
limited partner of the Partnership, subject to certain reasonable limitations,
to address concerns with respect to, among other things, the confidentiality of
certain information. Such information shall be used only for a purpose
reasonably related to the Limited Partner's interest as a limited partner of the
Partnership. The Register shall reflect the name and address of each of the

each Partner and the amount and date of any payment to any of the Limited
Partners representing a return of any part of their Capital Contributions in the

Partnership bank accounts and brokerage accounts, and withdrawals shall be made

deemed activities in the ordinary course of Partnership business.

          11.4. APPRAISAL. If at any time the value of one or more non-cash
assets of the Partnership is required to be determined under this Agreement, the
General Partner shall value such assets, taking into account all relevant
factors, including without limitation restrictions on transfer, other legal or
contractual restrictions and the costs and expenses of disposition of such
assets. In the sole discretion of the General Partner, the valuation of any
non-cash assets may be made by independent third parties appointed by the
General Partner and deemed qualified by the General Partner to render an opinion
as to the value of Partnership assets, using such methods and considering such
information relating to such assets as such persons may deem appropriate. The
valuation of Partnership assets reflected in an appraisal made in good faith by
the General Partner or any adviser or consultant retained for such purpose shall
be conclusive and binding on the Limited Partners.

THE CONTRARY SHALL BE MADE.

                                                                              27

          (iv)      all instruments relating to transfers of interests of
                    Limited Partners or to the admission of any substitute
                    Limited Partner undertaken as permitted hereunder,

          (v)       all certificates of assumed name and such other certificates
                    and instruments as may be necessary under the fictitious or
                    assumed name statutes from time to time in effect in the
                    Cayman Islands and all other jurisdictions in which the
                    Partnership conducts or plans to conduct its affairs, and

          (vi)      any other instruments determined by the General Partner to
                    be necessary or appropriate in connection with the proper
                    conduct of the business of the Partnership and which do not
                    adversely affect the interests of any of the Limited
                    Partners.

Such attorney-in-fact and agent shall not, however, have the right, power or
authority to amend or modify this Agreement when acting in such capacities,
except to the extent authorized herein. This power of attorney shall terminate
upon the bankruptcy, dissolution, disability or incompetence of the General
Partner. The power of attorney granted herein shall be deemed to be coupled with
an interest, shall be irrevocable, shall survive and not be affected by the
dissolution, bankruptcy or legal disability of any Limited Partner and shall
extend to its successors and assigns; and may be exercisable by such
attorney-in-fact and agent for all Limited Partners (or any of them) by listing
all (or any) of such Limited Partners required to execute any such instrument,
and executing such instrument acting as attorney-in-fact. Any Person dealing
with the Partnership may conclusively presume and rely upon the fact that any
instrument referred to above, and that is executed by such attorney-in-fact and
agent, is authorized, regular and binding, without further inquiry. If required,
each Limited Partner shall execute and deliver to the General Partner within
five days after the receipt of a request therefor, such further designations,
powers of attorney or other instruments as the General Partner shall reasonably
deem necessary for the purposes hereof.

          12.2. AMENDMENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT. (a) Except for any amendment to
this Agreement made pursuant to Section 12.2(c), an amendment to this Agreement
may be proposed by the General Partner by submitting to all Limited Partners the
text of such amendment and a statement of the purpose of such amendment. Subject
to paragraph (c) below, the proposed amendment shall be deemed adopted 15 days
after the General Partner submits such notice, unless Limited Partners holding
two-thirds of outstanding Units have, by the end of such notice period,
delivered their written disapproval thereof to the General Partner.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section to the
contrary, no amendment may:

          (i)       expand the obligations of any Partner under this Agreement
                    or convert the Units of any Limited Partner into the
                    interest of a General Partner or adversely affect the
                    limited liability of any Limited Partner, in each case
                    without the approval of such Partner;

          (ii)      amend Section 6.3 or this Section 12.2 without the approval
                    of all Partners; or

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

          (iii)     modify the method provided in Article 8 of distributing
                    distributable cash;

without the approval of the General Partner and Limited Partners holding a
majority of the outstanding Units that are adversely affected by such
modification.

          (c) In addition to any amendments otherwise authorized hereby, this
Agreement may be amended from time to time by the General Partner without the
consent of any of the Limited Partners to add to the representations, duties or
obligations of the General Partner or surrender any right or power granted to
the General Partner herein; to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any
provisions hereof which may be inconsistent with any other provision hereof, or
correct any printing, stenographic or clerical errors or omissions; to admit one
or more additional Limited Partners or one or more substituted Limited Partners,
or withdraw one or more Limited Partners, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; PROVIDED that no amendment shall be adopted pursuant to this
subsection (c) unless (x) in the case of any amendment referred to in clause (i)
or (ii) of this subsection, such amendment would not adversely alter the
interest of a Limited Partner in connection with the allocation of any income,
gains or losses or distributions or the timing thereof without the consent of
such Partner, and (y) such amendment would not, in the opinion of counsel for
the Partnership (which opinion the Limited Partners are legally entitled to rely
on), alter, or result in the alteration of, the limited liability of the Limited
Partners or the status of the Partnership as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. The General Partner shall send each Limited Partner a copy of any
amendment adopted pursuant to this paragraph (c).

          (d) Upon the adoption of any amendment to this Agreement, such
amendment (or an amended restated Agreement) shall be executed by the General
Partner for itself and on behalf of the Limited Partners pursuant to the power
of attorney granted in Section 12.1, and, if such amendment affects the
certificate of limited partnership of the Partnership under the Act, or any
other filing made in any other state, the General Partner, pursuant to the power
of attorney granted in Section 12.1, shall execute and file proper amendments
and filings in the Cayman Islands and in each jurisdiction in which such action
is necessary for the Partnership to conduct business or to preserve the limited
liability of the Limited Partners.

          12.3. ARBITRATION. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
in connection with or relating to this Agreement or any breach or alleged breach
hereof shall (to the extent not prohibited by governing law) be determined and
settled by arbitration in Bermuda pursuant to the rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. Any award rendered shall be final and
conclusive upon the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in the courts
of Bermuda.

operation of or affect those portions of this Agreement that are valid.
