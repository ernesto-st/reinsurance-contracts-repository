           or 6.9 hereof in connection with a bona fide third party transaction,
              ---
           the Company and the Required Holders have not reached agreement

                 Once notice of prepayment has been sent to the Holders in
                 accordance with this Section 4.2(b), the Notes shall become due
                                      --------------
                 and payable on the prepayment date at the applicable prepayment
                 price, and upon prepayment of the Notes in full in accordance
                 with this paragraph 4.2, the Holders shall be deemed to have
                 consented to such Waiver Request.

           accordance with the terms of this Section 4.2, the Company shall pay
                                             -----------

           as percentages of principal amount) of one hundred eight percent
           (108%) plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the
           applicable prepayment date, and (ii) with respect to the Series B

           (112.270%) plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the
           prepayment date.

                 4.2.4   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
           prepayment occur later than the date on which the transaction that is
           the subject of the Waiver Request is consummated.

           4.3.  Partial Payments Pro Rata. Upon any required prepayment

           offer to prepay, in accordance with and subject to this paragraph
           4.4, all, but not less than all, the Notes held by each holder (in
           this case only, "holder" in respect of any Note registered in the
           name of a nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such
           beneficial owner) (a) with respect to the circumstances described in

stock of the Company (the "Conversion Shares") on the following basis:

                 4.6.1   Conversion at the Option of the Holder. The holders of
                         ---------------------------------------
           the Convertible Notes may convert some or all of outstanding
           principal balance of such Notes at any time.

                 4.6.2   Conversion at the Option of the Company. If in any

           Convertible Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the

                 4.6.3   Conversion Price. The conversion price for such shares
                         ----------------

           paragraph 4.6 (each a "Conversion") shall be effectuated by the
           holder of a Convertible Note surrendering such Note(s) to the
           Company, together with (a) with respect to a Conversion under
           paragraph 4.6.1, a written notice by such holder of the name and
           address in which and to which the certificates representing the
           shares of Conversion Shares issuable upon such Conversion shall be
           issued or (b) with respect to a Conversion under paragraph 4.6.2, the
           Company Notice (in each case, the "Conversion Notice"). For purposes
           hereof, the "Conversion Date" means (x) with respect to Conversion
           under paragraph 4.6.1, the date upon which such Note(s) and the
           Conversion Notice have been received by the Company, and (y) with

           Conversion together with any cash (i) instead of fractional shares as
           provided in paragraph 4.6.5 and (ii) for accrued but unpaid interest
           under such Note(s) with respect to the principal balance so
           converted. Such Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected
           immediately prior to the close of business on the Conversion Date,
           and subject to the receipt of the certificate(s) for shares of
           Conversion Shares and any cash due upon Conversion at such time the
           rights of the Holder of such Notes shall cease and the person or
           persons in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for
           shares of Conversion Shares shall be issuable upon such Conversion
           shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the
           shares of common stock of the Company represented thereby.

                 4.6.5   Fractional Shares. No fractional share of Common Stock
                         -----------------
           or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon
           Conversion of the principal balance. Instead, the Company shall pay
           cash in an amount equal to the Closing Price of a share of Common
           Stock on the Conversion Date multiplied by the fraction of a full
           share represented by such fractional share.

                 4.6.6   Reservation of Securities. The Company shall at all
                         -------------------------
           times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued
           shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the
           conversion of the Convertible Notes such number of its shares of
           Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
           conversion of such Note(s); and if at any time the number of
           authorized but unissued shares of the Common Stock shall not be
           sufficient to effect the conversion of the entire outstanding
           principal amount of the Convertible Notes in addition to such other
           remedies as shall be available to the holder of such Notes, the
           Company will use its best efforts to take such corporate action as
           may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its
           authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of
           shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

                 4.6.7   Registration Rights.
                         -------------------

           (a)   All shares of the Company's securities issued or issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Notes shall have the registration rights and
related obligations set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, and the
parties hereto shall each execute such agreements, documents and instruments in
connection therewith as reasonably requested to fulfill the purposes of this
paragraph 4.6.7.

           (b)   The Company covenants and agrees to (i) prepare and file with
the Commission promptly after the Issue Date, but in no event later than the
120/th/ day after the Issue

                                     -11-
<PAGE>

Date, a Resale Shelf , (ii) use its best efforts to cause such Resale Shelf to
be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
the filing thereof, but in no event later than the 180/th/ day after the Issue
Date and (iii) use its best efforts to keep the Resale Shelf effective until
April 12, 2009 or such shorter period that will terminate when all of the
Conversion Shares have been sold pursuant to a registration statement filed
under the Securities Act covering the Conversion Shares.

          (c)  The Company covenants and agrees to (i) list all Conversion
Shares issued or issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes on the
American Stock Exchange or any other securities exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed or (ii) authorize for quotation on the NASDAQ or the
National Market System of NASDAQ all Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Notes if the Common Stock is then so authorized
for quotation.

               4.6.8  Stock Dividends, Subdivisions and Combinations. In case
                      ----------------------------------------------
          the Company shall hereafter:

          (a)  pay a dividend or make a distribution in shares of Common Stock
or securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to
receive directly, or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock,

          (b)  reclassify by subdivision its outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a greater number of shares, or

          (c)  reclassify by combination its outstanding shares of Common Stock
or into a smaller number of shares,

                      (i)  the number of Conversion Shares receivable upon
                      conversion of each Convertible Note immediately prior
                      thereto shall be adjusted so that the holder of each
                      Convertible Note thereafter converted shall be entitled to
                      receive the number of Conversion Shares which such holder
                      would have owned immediately following such action had
                      such Convertible Note been converted immediately prior
                      thereto, and

                      (ii) the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying
                      such Conversion Price immediately prior to such adjustment
                      by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number
                      of Conversion Shares purchasable upon the conversion of
                      each Convertible Note immediately prior to such
                      adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the
                      number of Conversion Shares purchasable immediately
                      thereafter.

     An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.6.8 shall become effective
immediately after the record date, in the case of a dividend, and shall become
effective immediately after the effective date, in the case of a subdivision,
combination or reclassification. If, as a result of an

                                     -12-
<PAGE>

adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.6, the holder of any Convertible Note
thereafter converted shall become entitled to receive shares of two or more
classes of capital stock of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall determine, in its reasonable discretion, the allocation of the adjusted
Conversion Price between or among shares of such classes of capital stock.

               4.6.9   Reclassification, Combinations, Mergers, etc. If:
                       --------------------------------------------

          (a)  any capital reorganization, reclassification or change of
outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than as set forth in paragraph 4.6.8
and other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from
no par value to par value provided that the Company shall not increase the par
value of the Common Stock to exceed the Conversion Price), or

          (b)  in case of any consolidation or merger of the Company with or
into another corporation or other entity (other than a merger in which the
Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any
reclassification or change of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or
other capital stock of the Company (other than a change in par value, or from
par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value or as a result of a
subdivision or combination)) or

          (c)  in case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or other
entity of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall be
effected in such a way that the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive shares of common stock, other securities or assets (whether such stock,
other securities or assets are issued or distributed by the Company or another
Person) with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then,

     as a condition of such reclassification, reorganization, change,
consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, the Company or such a successor or
purchasing corporation or other entity, as the case may be, shall forthwith make
lawful and adequate provision whereby the holder of such Convertible Notes then
outstanding shall have the right thereafter to receive on conversion of such
Convertible Notes the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities
and assets receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, change,
consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock that such holders would have been entitled to receive upon
conversion of such Convertible Notes had such Convertible Notes been converted
immediately before such reclassification, reorganization, change, consolidation,
merger, sale or conveyance that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph 4.6.

     For purposes of this paragraph 4.6.9, "shares of stock and other securities
and property" receivable upon a reclassification, change, consolidation, merger,
sale or conveyance shall include stock of any successor or acquiring corporation
of any class which is not subject to redemption and shall also include any
evidence of indebtedness, shares of stock or other securities which are
convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock, either immediately or upon
the arrival of a specified date or the happening of a specified event including
any warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any such stock.

                                     -13-
<PAGE>

     In case of any such reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation
or dispositions of assets, the successor or acquiring corporation or other
entity shall expressly assume the due and punctual observance and performance of
each and every covenant and condition of this Agreement and the Convertible
Notes to be performed and observed by the Company and all the obligations and
liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed
appropriate (as determined in good faith by resolution of the Board of Directors
of the Company) in order to provide for adjustments of Conversion Shares into
which each Convertible Note may be converted, which shall be as nearly
equivalent as practicable to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph 4.6.

               4.6.10  Issuances of Common Stock or Rights. In the event that
                       -----------------------------------
          the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the date
          hereof, issue, sell distribute or otherwise grant (in any such case, a
          "Distribution") shares of Common Stock or Rights, whether or not such
          Rights are immediately exercisable, convertible or exchangeable, at a
          Consideration Per Share lower than the per share Fair Market Value of
          the Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale, or if the
          Company shall amend any of the provisions of any Rights, including,
          without limitation, a change in the purchase, conversion, exchange or
          exercise price per share of Common Stock, as the case may be, of any
          such Right, or the Aggregate Consideration Receivable applicable to
          any such Right (other than under or by reason of provisions designed
          to protect against dilution upon an event which results in an
          adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 4.6 which is no less favorable
          to the holders of the Convertible Notes than such adjustment is to the
          holder of such Rights), then, immediately after the date of such
          issuance or sale,

          (a)  the number of Conversion Shares purchasable upon conversion of
each Convertible Note shall be increased so that the holders of such Convertible
Notes thereafter will be entitled to receive the number of Conversion Shares
determined by multiplying:

                       (i)  the number of shares of Common Stock the holders of
                       Convertible Notes would have been entitled to receive
                       immediately before the date of such issuance or sale had
                       such holders converted their Convertible Notes
                       immediately prior thereto; by

                       (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the sum
                       of: (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
                       on such date plus (B) the number of additional shares of
                       Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase (or
                       into which the Rights so offered are initially
                       convertible or exchangeable or exercisable, as the case
                       may be), and the denominator of which shall be the sum
                       of: (x) the number of shares of Common Stock and
                       outstanding on such date plus (y) the number of shares of
                       Common Stock that the Aggregate Consideration Receivable
                       would purchase at such per share Fair Market Value of the
                       Common Stock on the date of such issuance or sale, and

                                     -14-
<PAGE>

          (b)  the Conversion Price in effect immediately after such
Distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such Distribution by the quotient of:

                       (i)  the sum of: (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
                       and outstanding immediately prior to such Distribution;
                       plus (B) the quotient of: (x) the Aggregate Consideration
                       Receivable; divided by (y) the per share Fair Market
                       Value of the Common Stock; in each case immediately prior
                       to such Distribution; divided by

                       (ii) the sum of: (A) the number of shares of Common Stock
                       and outstanding immediately prior to such Distribution;
                       plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock so issued
                       or sold (or initially issuable pursuant to any Rights).

     No adjustment shall be made pursuant to subparagraph (a) above which would
decrease the number of shares of Common Stock upon for which a Convertible Note
may be converted. No adjustment shall be made pursuant to subparagraph (b) above
which would increase the Conversion Price.

     For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the total maximum number of
shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange, as
applicable, of all Rights shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of
such Distribution and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding and the
Company shall be deemed to have received as consideration therefor the Aggregate
Consideration Receivable applicable thereto after giving effect to such
exercise, conversion or exchange. Except as provided in paragraph 4.6.14, no
additional adjustments of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual
exercise, exchange or conversion, as applicable, of such Rights.

               4.6.11  Dividends and Distributions. In the event the Company
                       ---------------------------
          shall, at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, make or
          pay any dividend of, or distribute to holders of Common Stock (in any
          such case, a "Dividend"), shares of capital stock, any of its property
          or assets (other than cash but only to the extent that such cash
          dividends are issued in the Company's ordinary course of business
          consistent with past practice), evidences of its indebtedness, Rights
          or other securities (in each case, other than dividends payable in
          Common Stock or securities or rights convertible or exchangeable into
          Common Stock) (collectively, "Dividend Securities"), then, in each
          such case, the Company shall reserve shares or other units of such
          Dividend Securities for distribution to the holders upon conversion of
          the Convertible Notes so that, in addition to the Conversion Shares
          issuable upon exercise thereof, such holders will receive upon such
          exercise the amount and kind of such Dividend Securities that such
          holders would have received if the holders had, immediately prior to
          the record date for the distribution of the Dividend Securities,
          converted the Convertible Notes.

               4.6.12  Self-Tenders. If, at any time or from time to time after
                       ------------
          the date hereof, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall
          repurchase, by self-tender offer or otherwise, any shares of Common
          Stock of the Company or any Right at a weighted average purchase price
          in excess of the per share Fair Market Value of the Common Stock then
          on the Business Day immediately prior to the earliest of (i) the date
          of such repurchase, (ii) the commencement of an offer to repurchase or
          (iii) the public announcement of either (such date being referred to
          as the "Determination Date"), the Company shall offer to repurchase
          the Conversion Shares on the same terms and conditions on which it has
          offered to repurchase the shares of Common Stock.

               4.6.13  Fair Market Value of Consideration Received.
                       -------------------------------------------
          Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, for purposes of
          this paragraph 4.6, if any Rights shall be issued in connection with
          the issuance and sale of other securities of the Company, together
          comprising one integral transaction in which no specific consideration
          is allocated to such Rights by the parties thereto, such Rights shall
          be deemed to have been issued without consideration, provided,
          however, that if any such Rights have an exercise price (to the extent
          applicable) equal to or greater than the per share Fair Market Value
          of the Common Stock on the date of issuance of such Rights, then such
          Rights shall be deemed to have been issued for consideration equal to
          such exercise price.

               4.6.14  Deferral of Certain Adjustments. No adjustment need be
                       -------------------------------
          made for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; provided,
          however, the Company shall not increase the par value of the Common
          Stock to exceed the Conversion Price. All calculations under this
          paragraph 4.6 shall be made to the nearest 1/1,000 of one cent or to
          the nearest 1/1,000th of a Conversion Share, as the case may be.

               4.6.15  Other Adjustments. In the event that at any time, as a
                       -----------------
          result of an adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph 4.6, holders
          of the Convertible Notes shall become entitled to receive any
          securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock,
          thereafter the number of such other securities so receivable upon
          conversion of each Convertible Note and the Conversion Price
          applicable to such exercise shall be subject to adjustment from time
          to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable
          to the provisions with respect to the Conversion Shares and the
          Conversion Price contained in this paragraph 4.6, and all other
          relevant provisions of this paragraph 4.6 that are applicable to
          shares of Common Stock shall be applicable to such other securities.
          In case at any time or from time to time the Company shall take any
          action in respect of its outstanding shares of Common Stock, other
          than any action described in this paragraph 4.6, or any event occurs
          as to which the provisions of this paragraph 4.6 are not strictly
          applicable, then the number of Conversion Shares into which each
          Convertible Note may be converted shall be adjusted in such manner as
          may be equitable in the circumstances and on terms as nearly
          equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the
          Conversion Shares and the Conversion Price

                                     -16-
<PAGE>

          contained in this paragraph 4.6 and as shall be reasonably necessary,
          in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company, to
          protect the exercise rights of the holders of the Convertible Notes,
          but in no event shall any such adjustment have the effect of adversely
          affecting the holders of the Convertible Notes. If the Company shall
          at any time or from time to time issue, sell or distribute any shares
          of capital stock (other than Common Stock), any evidences of
          indebtedness, any property or assets, Rights or other securities,
          then, in each such case, such issuance, sale or distribution shall be
          deemed to be of, or in respect of, Common Stock for purposes of this
          paragraph 4.6.

               4.6.16  Increased Conversion Shares or Reduced Conversion Price.
                       -------------------------------------------------------
          From time to time, the Company may, for a period of not less than
          twenty (20) Business Days, in its discretion, upon written notice to
          holders of Convertible Notes, increase the number of Conversion Shares
          purchasable upon the conversion of each Convertible Note, without
          making any adjustment to the Conversion Price, or reduce the
          Conversion Price, without making any adjustment to the number of
          Conversion Shares purchasable upon the conversion of each Convertible
          Note; provided that in the event that the Company elects to make any
          such adjustment, the Company shall make the same or proportional
          adjustment, as the case may be, with respect to all outstanding
          Convertible Notes.

               4.6.17  No Adjustments for Certain Incentive Compensation.
                       -------------------------------------------------
          Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, it is expressly understood
          that the Convertible Notes shall not be adjusted with respect to (a)
          Common Stock or Rights, in any case, that may be issued to any of the
          Company's officers or employees pursuant to the stock option plans or
          similar plans of the Company, including, without limitation, under the
          AirTran Holdings, Inc. 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 1993
          Incentive Stock Options Plan, 1994 and 1996 stock option plans,
          Airways Corporation's 1995 Stock Option Plan, and Airways
          Corporation's 1995 Director Stock Option Plan (collectively, the
          "Plans"), to the extent that shares of Common Stock or other
          securities issued or granted under such Plans are issued or granted at
          a price, or with an exercise price, that is no less than the per share
          Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the date of grant or issuance
          and such grant or issuance, together with all previous grants and
          issuances under all such Plans, represents not more than 10% of the
          fully diluted Common Stock at the time of such grant or issuance, (b)
          the conversion or exchange (other than pursuant to a
          reclassification), in any case on a share-for-share basis, of Common
          Stock for non-voting Common Stock, or (c) the issuance of any
          Conversion Shares.

               4.6.18  No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its
                       -------------
          certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer
          of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation, issue or
          sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
          avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed
          or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good
          faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this

                                     -17-
<PAGE>

          paragraph 4.6 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary
          or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders of the
          Convertible Notes against impairment.

               4.6.19  Further Equitable Adjustments. If, after one or more
                       -----------------------------
          adjustments to the Conversion Price pursuant to this paragraph 4.6,
          the Conversion Price cannot be reduced further without falling below
          the greater of (i) the par value of the Common Stock or (ii) the
          lowest positive conversion price legally permissible for convertible
          notes to acquire shares of common stock, the Company shall make
          further adjustments to compensate the holders of the Convertible
          Notes, consistent with the foregoing principles, as the Board of
          Directors of the Company, acting in good faith, deems necessary,
          including an increase in the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon
          conversion of outstanding Convertible Notes and/or a cash payment to
          the holders of the Convertible Notes.

               4.6.20  Other Adjustments.
                       -----------------

          (a)  Adjustments shall be made pursuant to this paragraph 4.6
successively whenever any of the events referred to in subparagraphs 4.6.6,
4.6.8 through 4.6.19, inclusive shall occur.

          (b)  If any Convertible Note shall be converted subsequent to the
record date for any of the events referred to in this paragraph 4.6, but prior
to the effective date thereof, appropriate adjustments shall be made immediately
after such effective date so that the holder of such Convertible Note on such
record date shall have received, in the aggregate, the kind and number of shares
of Common Stock or other securities or property or assets that it would have
owned or been entitled to receive on such effective date had such Convertible
note been converted prior to such record date.

          (c)  Shares of Common Stock owned by or held for the account of the
Company shall not, for purposes of the adjustments set forth in this paragraph
4.6 be deemed outstanding.

               4.6.21  Expiration of Rights. Upon the expiration of any Rights
                       --------------------
          referred to in this paragraph 4.6, without the exercise, exchange or
          conversion, as applicable, thereof, the Conversion Price and the
          number of Conversion Shares shall, upon such expiration, be readjusted
          and shall thereafter be such Conversion Price and such number of
          Conversion Shares as would have been had such Conversion Price and
          such number of Conversion Shares originally been adjusted (or had the
          original adjustment not been required, as the case may be) as if:

          (a)  the only shares of Common Stock so issued were the shares of
Common Stock, if any, actually issued or sold upon the exercise of such Rights;
and

          (b)  such shares of Common Stock, if any, were issued or sold for the
consideration actually received by the Company upon such exercise plus the
aggregate

                                     -18-
<PAGE>

consideration, if any, actually received by the Company for the issuance, sale
or grant of all such Rights, whether or not exercised; provided, however, that
no such readjustment shall have the effect of increasing the Conversion Price by
an amount in excess of the amount of the reduction initially made in respect of
the issuance, sale, or grant of such Rights.

               4.6.22  When Adjustment Not Required. If the Company shall take a
                       ----------------------------
          record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling
          them to receive a dividend or distribution or subscription or purchase
          rights and shall, thereafter and before the distribution to
          stockholders thereof, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such
          dividend, distribution, subscription or purchase rights, then
          thereafter no adjustment shall be required by reason of the taking of
          such record and any such adjustment previously made in respect thereof
          shall be rescinded and annulled.

               4.6.23  Treasury Stock. The sale or other disposition of any
                       --------------
          issued shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of
          the Company shall be deemed an issuance thereof.

               4.6.24  Notices to Holders of Convertible Notes. Whenever the
                       ---------------------------------------
          number of Conversion Shares is adjusted or the Conversion Price in
          respect thereof is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall
          promptly give to each holder of Convertible Notes notice of such
          adjustment or adjustments and shall promptly deliver to each holder of
          Convertible Notes an Officer's Certificate (confirmed by a certificate
          from the Company's independent certified public accountants) setting
          forth: (i) the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon the exercise
          of each Convertible Note and the Conversion Price of such shares after
          such adjustment; (ii) a brief statement of the facts requiring such
          adjustment; and (iii) the computation by which such adjustment was
          made.

     So long as any Convertible Note is outstanding, within ninety (90) days
of the end of each fiscal year of the Company, the Company shall deliver to each
holder of Convertible Notes an Officer's Certificate setting forth: (i) the
number of Conversion Shares issuable upon the conversion of each Convertible
Note and the Conversion Price of such shares as of the end of such fiscal year;
(ii) a brief statement of the facts requiring each adjustment, if any, required
to be made in such fiscal year; and (iii) the computation by which each such
adjustment was made.

          authorized financial officer of the Company; provided, however, that
                                                       --------  -------

               5.1.4  promptly upon receipt thereof, a copy of each other report
          submitted to the Company or any Subsidiary by independent accountants

               5.1.5  with reasonable promptness, (i) such other information as
          such Significant Holder may reasonably request, and (ii) copies of
          other reports as are provided to the Collateral Trustee, any Bank
          Agent or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

               5.1.6  Together with each delivery of financial statements
          required by clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Company will deliver to
          each Holder an Officer's

                                     -20-
<PAGE>

          Certificate demonstrating (with computations in reasonable detail)
          compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries with the provisions of
          Section 6, and stating that there exists no Event of Default or

          financial statements, they have obtained no knowledge of any Event of
          Default or Default, or, if they have obtained knowledge of any Event
          of Default or Default, specifying the nature and period of existence
          thereof. Such accountants, however, shall not be liable to anyone by
          reason of their failure to obtain knowledge of any Event of Default or
          Default which would not be disclosed in the course of an audit
          conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
          The Company also covenants that immediately after any Responsible
          Officer obtains knowledge of an Event of Default or Default, it will
          deliver to each Significant Holder an Officer's Certificate specifying
          the nature and period of existence thereof and what action the Company
          proposes to take with respect thereto.

          5.2.  Information Required by Rule 144A. The Company will, upon the
                ---------------------------------
request of the holder of any Note, provide such holder, and any qualified
institutional buyer designated by such holder, such financial and other
information as such holder may reasonably determine to be necessary in order to
permit compliance with the information requirements of Rule 144A under the
Securities Act in connection with the resale of Notes, except at such times as
the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act. For the purpose of this paragraph 5.2, the term "qualified
institutional buyer" shall have the meaning specified in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act.

          5.3.  Covenant to Secure Notes Equally. The Company covenants that if
                --------------------------------
it or any Subsidiary shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its property or
assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than Liens permitted by
the provisions of paragraph 6.3 (unless prior written consent to the creation or
assumption thereof shall have been obtained pursuant to paragraph 12.3), it will
make or cause to be made effective provision whereby the Notes will be secured
by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all other Indebtedness (subject
only to the provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement) thereby secured so
long as any such other Indebtedness shall be so secured.

          5.4.  Compliance with Law. The Company will, and will cause each of
                -------------------
its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, ordinances or governmental rules or
regulations to which each of them is subject, including, without limitation,
environmental laws, and will obtain and maintain in effect all licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations
necessary to the ownership of their respective properties or to the conduct of
their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary to ensure that
non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations
or failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses, certificates,
permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations

                                     -21-

                ---------------------------------------
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good
repair, working order and condition all Collateral and properties used or useful
in their businesses; provided, however, that, subject to the requirements of the
                     --------  -------
Collateral Documents, neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary shall be
prevented from discontinuing those operations or suspending the maintenance of
that Collateral or those properties which, in the Company's reasonable judgment,
are no longer necessary or useful in the conduct of the Company's business or
that of its Subsidiaries. For so long as any Collateral or property is deemed to
be useful to the conduct of the Company's business or that of its Subsidiaries,
the Company shall, or shall cause such Subsidiaries to, maintain appropriate
insurance, generally in accordance with industry practices, on such Collateral
and properties and as required under the provisions of the Collateral Documents;
provided, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall at all times carry
and maintain, or cause to be carried and maintained, insurance on and in respect
of the Aircraft, the Airframes and the Engines (in each case as defined in the
Aircraft Mortgage) in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.06 and Annex B
of the Aircraft Mortgage.

          5.6.  Payment of Taxes. The Company shall, and shall cause each
                ----------------
Subsidiary to, pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the
same shall become delinquent, (a) all taxes, assessments and governmental
charges levied or imposed upon the Company and each Subsidiary or upon the
income, profits or Property of the Company and each Subsidiary or upon the
Collateral and (b) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if
unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon the Collateral, or the other Property of
the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company or a
                               --------  -------
Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay or discharge or
cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim (i) the
amount, applicability or validity of which is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings, and for which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP, or (ii) if the Company delivers to the Significant
Holders an Officers' Certificate stating that such non-payment and non-discharge
is in the interest of the Company and not prejudicial in any material respect to
the Holders.

     Nothing contained herein or in the Notes shall be deemed to impose on the
Company any obligation to pay on behalf of the Holder of any Notes any tax,
assessment or governmental charge required by any present or future law of the
U.S. or of any state, county, municipality or other taxing authority thereof to
be paid on behalf of, or withheld from the amount payable to, the Holder of any
Notes; rather any tax, assessment or governmental charge shall, to the extent
required by law, be withheld from the amounts provided for herein.

     The Company shall treat the Notes as debt instruments issued at fair market
value for Tax purposes, shall treat the Notes as applicable high yield debt
obligations under Section 163(i) of the code bearing original issue discount
within the meaning of Section 1273(a)(1) of the Code, and shall treat the
appropriate amounts under the Code as the disqualified portion and the dividend
equivalent portion.

6, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and
keep in full force and effect the corporate existence, rights (charter and
statutory), licenses, permits, approvals and governmental franchises of the
Company and each Subsidiary necessary to the conduct of its respective business;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such
--------  -------
right, license or franchise, or (other than with respect to the Restricted
Subsidiaries) to preserve the corporate existence of any such Subsidiary, if the
Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof
is no longer in the interest of the Company and that termination of the
corporate existence is not disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect.

               5.7.1 The Company shall cause Airways to continue to be an air
          carrier certificated under Section 604(b) of the Federal Aviation Act.

          Aviation Act. To the extent required to operate Airways' business as
          presently conducted and to perform Airways' obligations under the

          Documents, the Company shall cause Airways to remain a "citizen of the
          United States" as defined in Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation
          Act.

          5.8. Lines of Business. The Company covenants that it will not, and it
               -----------------
will not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, engage in any business if, as
a result thereof, the general nature of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would be substantially changed from the
businesses of the Company as described in the Form 10-K filed April 2, 2001 by
the Company with the Commission for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000, as
amended by the Form 10-K/A filed April 12, 2001 by the Company with the
Commission for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 (the "Company 10-K").

          5.9. ERISA Compliance. The Company shall comply, and shall cause each
               ----------------
ERISA Affiliate to comply, in all material respects, with the provisions of
ERISA and the Code applicable to each Plan. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall meet, and shall cause all ERISA Affiliates to meet, all
minimum funding requirements applicable to them with respect to any Plan
pursuant to section 302 of ERISA or section 412 of the Code, without giving
effect to any waivers of such requirements or extensions of the related

benefit obligations under any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA that is not a
Multiemployer Plan exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan
allocable to such benefits by more than $1,000,000. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not withdraw, and shall cause all other ERISA Affiliates not
to withdraw, in whole or in part, from any Multiemployer Plan so as to give rise
to withdrawal liability exceeding $1,000,000 in the aggregate. At no time shall
the actuarial present value of unfunded liabilities for post-employment health
care benefits, whether or not provided under a Plan, calculated in a manner
consistent with Statement No. 106 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
exceed $1,000,000.

                -----------------------
each holder of Notes of, and provide such holder with copies of any
notifications of, discharges or releases or threatened releases or discharges of
a Polluting Substance on, upon, into or from the Collateral which are given or
required to be given by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

agrees promptly to undertake and pursue diligently to completion, or to cause
its Subsidiaries to undertake and pursue diligently to completion, any

amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale/Leaseback

in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) as disclosed in the Holdings SEC Documents or

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no
condition that, with the passage of time or otherwise, would (i) constitute a
violation of such Charter Documents or Applicable Laws, (ii) constitute a breach
of or default under any Applicable Agreement, or (iii) result in the imposition
of any penalty or the acceleration of any indebtedness other than, with respect

          9.9. No Consents. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of
               -----------
the Transaction Documents nor the consummation of the Transactions shall
conflict with, violate, constitute a breach of or a default (with the passage of
time or otherwise) under, require the consent of any person (other than consents
already obtained) under, result in the imposition of a Lien on any assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (except pursuant to the Transaction Documents), or
result in an acceleration of indebtedness under or pursuant to (i) the Charter
Documents, (ii) any Applicable Agreement, other than, with respect to this
clause (ii) only, such breaches, violations or defaults as disclosed in the
Holdings SEC Documents or that could not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) any Applicable Law.
After giving effect to the Transactions, no Default or Event of Default will
exist.

          9.10. No permit, certificate, authorization, approval, consent,
license or order of, or filing, registration, declaration or qualification with,
any Governmental Authority (collectively, "Permits") and no approval or consent
of any other person, is required in connection with, or as a condition to, the
execution, delivery or performance of any of the Transaction Documents or the
consummation of any of the Transactions, other than such Permits (i) as have
been made or obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) as are not required
to be made or obtained on or prior to the Closing Date that will be made or
obtained when required, or (iii) the failure of which to make or obtain could
not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          9.11. Except as disclosed in the Holdings SEC Documents, there is no
Proceeding pending or to the actual knowledge of the Company after reasonable
inquiry, threatened, that either (i) seeks to restrain, enjoin, prevent the
consummation of, or otherwise challenge any of the Transaction Documents or any
of the Transactions, or (ii) could, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither of the Company or its
Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, order, decree, rule or regulation of

and each of their respective directors, members, managers, officers, employees
and agents (collectively, the "Regulated Persons") shall have, and will be in
compliance with the terms and conditions of, all Permits (including, without
limitation, Permits with respect to engaging in aviation activities or
operations) necessary or advisable to own, lease and operate the properties and
to conduct the businesses described in the Holdings SEC Documents other than
those the failure of which to have could not, singly or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Immediately following
the Closing, all such Permits will be valid and in full force and effect. To the
actual knowledge of the Company, after reasonable inquiry, no event has occurred
which allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, the imposition of
any material penalty, revocation or termination by the issuer thereof or which
results, or after notice or lapse of time would result, in any material
impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Permits. The Company does not
have actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, that either of the Company or
Airways is considering limiting, conditioning, suspending, modifying, revoking
or not renewing any such Permit.

                                     -40-
<PAGE>

          9.13. To the actual knowledge of the Company, after reasonable
inquiry, (i) no Governmental Authority is investigating any Regulated Person
(other than ordinary course reviews by one or more Governmental Authorities
having jurisdiction over matters relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective business affairs), incident to the aviation activities or
operations of the Company or Airways), and (ii) there is no basis for the
Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") or any other Governmental Authority
to deny the renewal of the current Permits held by either of the Company or
Airways.

          9.14. Airways is an "air carrier" within the meaning of the
Transportation Code that is a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning
of the Transportation Code and holds both a certificate under Section
41102(a)(1) of the Transportation Code and an air carrier operating certificate
issued pursuant to Chapter 447 under the Transportation Code for aircraft
capable of carrying ten or more individuals or 6,000 pounds or more of cargo.
Neither the Company nor Airways has received notice from the United States
Department of Transportation or the Federal Aviation Administration of any loss
of such certification or that any investigation by such Governmental Authority
has been commenced in relation to the potential revocation thereof.

          9.15. Immediately following the Closing, each of the Company and
Airways (i) will have good and marketable title, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens and the Liens identified on Schedule 9.15 hereto
                                                        --------------------
(the "Identified Liens")), to the Collateral, and to all property and assets
described in the Holdings SEC Documents as being owned by it, and (ii) will
enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all leases to which it is a
party as lessee.

          9.16. Immediately following the Closing, the assets of each of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will include all of the assets and
properties that will be used in, or are otherwise material to, the conduct of
the respective businesses of each of the Company and each Restricted
Subsidiaries as proposed to be conducted, and such assets are in working
condition, except where the failure of such assets to be in working condition
could not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          9.17. Immediately following the Closing, each of the Company and each
Restricted Subsidiary shall maintain appropriate insurance covering its
properties, operations, personnel and businesses against such losses and risks
substantially in accordance with customary industry practice.

          9.18. All material Tax returns required to be filed by each of the
Company and Airways has been filed and all such returns are true, complete, and
correct in all material respects. All Taxes that are due or claimed from each of
the Company and Airways have been paid other than those (i) currently payable
without penalty or interest or (ii) being contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP. To the actual knowledge of the Company, after reasonable
inquiry, there are no proposed Tax assessments against either of the Company or
Airways that could singly or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.
The accruals and reserves on the books and records of each of the Company and
Airways in respect of any material Tax liability for any Taxable period not
finally determined are adequate to meet any

                                     -41-
<PAGE>

assessments of Tax for any such period. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Tax" and "Taxes" shall mean all federal, state, local and foreign taxes, and
other assessments of a similar nature (whether imposed directly or through
withholding), including any interest, additions to tax, or penalties applicable
thereto.

          9.19. Each of the Company and Airways owns, or is licensed under, and
has the right to use, all patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions,
copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or
unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures),
trademarks, service marks and trade names (collectively, "Intellectual
Property") necessary for the conduct of, its businesses, free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens and other than where the failure to own or
license such property could not, singly or, together with such Permitted Liens,
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To
the actual knowledge of the Company, after reasonable inquiry, (i) no claims
have been asserted by any person challenging the use of any such Intellectual
Property by either of the Company or Airways or questioning the validity or
effectiveness of any license or agreement related thereto, (ii) there is no
valid basis for any such claim (other than any claims that could not, singly or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect), and
(iii) the use of such Intellectual Property by either of the Company or Airways
will not infringe on the Intellectual Property rights of any other person.

          9.20. Each of the Company and Airways maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) material
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization, (ii) material transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles of the United States, consistently applied ("GAAP"), and
to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
material differences.

          9.21. The audited consolidated combined financial statements and
related notes of the Company contained in the Company 10-K (the "Financial
Statements") present fairly the combined financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company, as of the respective dates and for the
respective periods to which they apply, and have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP and the requirements of Regulation S-X.

Company, or has entered into any material transactions not in the ordinary
course of business, (ii) there has not been any decrease in the capital stock or
membership interests, as the case may be, or any increase in long-term
indebtedness or any material increase in short-term indebtedness of either of
the Company any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or any payment of or declaration
to pay any dividends or any other distribution with respect to either of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (iii) there has not been any material
adverse change in the properties, business, prospects, operations, earnings,
assets,

                                     -42-
<PAGE>

liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) of either of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary (each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), a "Material
Adverse Change"). To the actual knowledge of the Company after reasonable
inquiry, there is no event that is reasonably likely to occur, which if it were
to occur, could, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, except such events that have been adequately disclosed
in the Company 10-K or in Schedule 9.22 hereof.
                          -------------

          9.23. No "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act (i) has
imposed (or has informed either of the Company or Airways that it is considering
imposing) any condition (financial or otherwise) on either of the Company's or
Airways' retaining any rating assigned to such Person or to any securities of
such Person, or (ii) has indicated to either of the Company or Airways that it
is considering (A) the downgrading, suspension, or withdrawal of, or any review
for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible
change in, any rating so assigned, or (B) any change in the outlook for any
rating of either of the Company or Airways or any securities of either of the
Company or Airways.

          9.24. All indebtedness represented by the Notes is being incurred for
proper purposes and in good faith. On the Closing Date (after giving effect to
the Transactions), each of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be
solvent, and will have on the Closing Date (after giving effect to the
Transactions) sufficient capital for carrying on its business and will be on the
Closing Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) able to pay its debts as
they mature.

          9.25. Neither the Company nor Airways and, to the Company's actual
knowledge after reasonable inquiry, no one acting on their behalf has (i) taken,
directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or to result in, or that
has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to constitute, the
stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of either of the
Company or Airways to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Notes, (ii)
sold, bid for, purchased, or paid anyone any compensation for soliciting
purchases of, any of the Notes, or (iii) paid or agreed to pay to any person any

Act is required for the sale of the Notes to the Purchasers as contemplated
hereby, assuming the accuracy of the Purchaser's representations contained
herein regarding the absence of general solicitation in connection with the sale
of the Notes to the Purchaser. No form of general solicitation or general
advertising was used by the Company or any of its Affiliates or, to the actual
knowledge of the Company after, reasonable inquiry, any of their respective
representatives in connection with the offer and sale of any of the Notes.
Except as disclosed in the Company 10-K, no securities of the same class as any
of the Notes have been offered, issued or sold by the Company or any of its
Affiliates within the six-month period immediately prior to the date hereof.

          9.27. Neither the Company nor any of its "Affiliates" is a "party in
interest" or a "disqualified person" with respect to any employee benefit plans.
To the actual knowledge of the Company, after reasonable inquiry, no condition
exists or event or transaction has occurred in

                                     -43-
<PAGE>

connection with any employee benefit plan that could result in either the
Company or any of its "Affiliates" incurring any liability, fine or penalty that
could, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any trade or business under common control with the Company (for
purposes of Section 414(c) of the Code) maintain any employee pension benefit
plan that is subject to ERISA. The terms "employee benefit plan," "employee
pension benefit plan," and "party in interest" shall have the meanings assigned
to such terms in Section 3 of ERISA. The term "Affiliate" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 407(d)(7) of ERISA, and the term "disqualified
person" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the Code.

(12 C.F.R. Part 220), Regulation U (12 C.F.R. Part 221) or Regulation X (12
C.F.R. Part 224) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).
Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is subject to regulation, nor
shall either of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary become subject to
regulation upon the consummation of the Transactions, under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations and
interpretations promulgated thereunder, or the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

          9.29. Except as set forth on Schedule 9.29, neither the Company nor
                                       -------------
any Restricted Subsidiary has dealt with any broker, finder, commission agent or
other person (other than the Purchaser) in connection with the Transactions, and
neither of the Company nor Airways is under any obligation to pay any broker's
fee or commission in connection with such transactions.

          9.30. Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is engaged in
any unfair labor practice. Except as disclosed in the Holdings SEC Documents,
there is (i) no unfair labor practice complaint or other proceeding pending or,
to the actual knowledge of the Company, after reasonable inquiry, threatened
against either the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary before the National
Labor Relations Board or any state, local or foreign labor relations board or
any industrial tribunal, and no grievance or arbitration proceeding arising out
of or under any collective bargaining agreement is so pending or threatened,
(ii) no strike, labor dispute, slowdown or stoppage is pending or, to the actual
knowledge of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary after reasonable inquiry,

representation question existing with respect to the employees of either of the

Company after reasonable inquiry, no union organizing activities are taking

Material Adverse Effect.

disclosed in the Holdings SEC Documents, (i) neither the Company nor any
Restricted Subsidiary in violation of any federal, state or local laws and
regulations (collectively, "Environmental Laws") relating to pollution or
protection of human health or the environment or the use, treatment, storage,
disposal, transport or handling, emission, discharge, release or threatened
release of toxic or hazardous substances, materials or wastes, or petroleum and
petroleum products ("Materials of Environmental Concern"), including, without
limitation, noncompliance with or lack of any

                                     -44-
<PAGE>

permits or other environmental authorizations; (ii) there are no past, present
or reasonably foreseeable circumstances that would be reasonably expected to
lead to any such violation in the future; (iii) neither the Company nor any
Restricted Subsidiary has received any communication from any person or entity
alleging any such violation; (iv) there is no pending or, to the actual
knowledge of the Company after reasonable inquiry, threatened claim, action,
investigation or notice by any person or entity against the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary or against any person or entity for whose acts or
omissions the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is or may reasonably be
expected to be liable, either contractually or by operation of law, alleging
liability for investigatory, cleanup, or other response costs, natural resources
or property damages, personal injuries, attorney's fees or penalties relating to
any Materials of Environmental Concern or any violation or potential violation
of any Environmental Law (collectively, "Environmental Claims"), and (v) to the
actual knowledge of the Company after reasonable inquiry, there are no actions,
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents that could form the
basis of any such Environmental Claim.

          9.32. In the ordinary course of business, the Company (i) conducts a
periodic review of the effect of Environmental Laws on its business, operations
and properties, and the Company has identified and evaluated associated costs

and any potential liabilities to third parties; and (ii) has conducted
environmental investigations of, and has reviewed information regarding, its
business, properties and operations, and those of other properties within the
vicinity of its businesses, properties and operations; on the basis of such

that, except as disclosed in the Holdings SEC Documents, any costs and
liabilities associated with such matters would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on either of the Company or Airways.

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or, to the actual knowledge of the Company
after reasonable inquiry, any other person (other than the Purchasers) in any of
the Transaction Documents or in any certificate or document required to be
delivered was or will be, when made, inaccurate, untrue or incorrect in any
material respect. Each certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and delivered to the Purchasers or counsel for the
Purchasers in connection with the Transactions shall be deemed to be a
representation and warranty by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to the
Purchasers as to the matters covered thereby.

          9.34. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          9.35. No other securities of the Company or Airways are of the same

on a national securities exchange registered under Section 6 of the Exchange
Act, or quoted in a U.S. automated inter-dealer quotation system. The Notes are
eligible for resale under Rule 144A.

by it with respect to each such lease except for such leases and obligations
which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As to leases
with respect to which any of the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries is the
lessor, the lessees and other parties under such leases are in compliance with
all material terms and conditions thereunder and such leases are in full force
and effect except for such leases which, if not in full force and effect, would
not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Affect.

          9.37. There are no legal or governmental proceedings involving or, to
the Company's knowledge, affecting the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
or any of their respective properties or assets which would be required to be

or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) under the Act or, with
respect to Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons (as defined

meaning of Rule 902 under the Act, and the Company and any Affiliate of either
and any person acting on behalf of either have complied with and will implement
the "offering restrictions" within the meaning of such Rule 902; provided, that
                                                                 --------

indirect, in the United States or to any U.S. person (as defined in Rule 902
under the Act) of any Note or any substantially similar security issued by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, within six months subsequent to

enforcing (or determining whether or how to enforce or cause the Collateral
Trustee to enforce) any rights under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the
Transaction Documents (including without limitation to protect, collect, lease,
sell, take possession of, release or liquidate any of the Collateral), or in
responding to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative
demand issued in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or by reason of
such Purchaser's or such Transferee's having acquired any Note, including
without limitation costs and expenses incurred in any bankruptcy case and (iii)
all costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees,
and of preparing, recording and filing all financing statements, instruments and
other documents to create, perfect and fully preserve and protect the Liens
granted in the Collateral Documents and the rights of the holders of the Notes
or of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The
obligations of the Company under this paragraph 12.2 shall survive the transfer
of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein by any Purchaser or any
Transferee and the payment of any Note.

               12.3. Consent to Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, and
                     ---------------------
the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act
herein required to be performed by it, if the Company shall obtain the written
consent to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s)
except that, without the written consent of the holder or holders of all Notes
at the time outstanding, no amendment to this Agreement shall change the
maturity of any Note, or change the principal of, or the rate or time of payment
of interest on, any Note, or affect the time, amount or allocation of any
prepayments, or change the proportion of the principal amount of the Notes
required with respect to any consent, amendment, waiver or declaration. Each
holder of any Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any
consent authorized by this paragraph 12.3, whether or not such Note shall have
been marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may bear a
notation referring to any such consent. No course of dealing between the Company
and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or
under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such
Note. As used herein and in the Notes, the term "this Agreement" and references
thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or
supplemented.

               12.4. Form, Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Notes; Lost
                     --------------------------------------------------------
Notes. The Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in
-----
denominations of at least $1,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any
principal amount not evenly divisible by $1,000. The

                                     -66-
<PAGE>

Company shall keep at its principal office a register in which the Company shall
provide for the registration of Notes and of transfers of Notes. Inasmuch as the
issue and sale of the Notes by the Company has not been registered under the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws, each
Purchaser and Transferee agrees that the Notes may not be offered or sold by
them in the absence of either an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and such state securities laws or the availability of exemptions
from registration thereunder. The Notes will bear a legend to the foregoing
effect. Subject to compliance with the foregoing requirements, upon surrender
for registration of transfer of any Note at the principal office of the Company,
the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver one or more new Notes of
like tenor and of a like aggregate principal amount, registered in the name of
such transferee or transferees. At the option of the holder of any Note, such
Note may be exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and of any authorized
denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Note
to be exchanged at the principal office of the Company. Whenever any Notes are
so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and
deliver the Notes which the holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed,
by the holder of such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.
Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon transfer thereof shall
carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to accrue which were carried by
the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that neither gain nor loss of interest
shall result from any such transfer or exchange. Upon receipt of written notice
from the holder of any Note of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
such Note and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt
of such holder's unsecured indemnity agreement, or in the case of any such
mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, the Company will make
and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Note.

               12.5. Persons Deemed Owners; Participations. Prior to due
                     -------------------------------------
presentment for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in
whose name any Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the
purpose of receiving payment of principal of, interest on, such Note and for all
other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the
Company shall not be affected by notice to the contrary. Subject to the
preceding sentence, and to the restrictions on transfer described in paragraph
12.4, the holder of any Note may from time to time grant participations in such
Note to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such
holder in its sole and absolute discretion, provided that any such participation
                                            --------
shall be in a principal amount of at least $100,000.

               12.6. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire
                     --------------------------------------------------
Agreement. All representations and warranties contained herein or in any other
---------
Transaction Documents or made in writing by or on behalf of the Company or any
Guarantor in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Notes, the
transfer by any Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and
the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of
any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any
Transferee. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the Notes embody the entire

                                     -67-
<PAGE>

agreement and understanding between the Purchasers and the Company and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the

expressed or not.

through no act or omission by such holder, or (c) that otherwise becomes known
to such holder, other than through disclosure by the Company, and provided, that

nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the holder of any Note from delivering
copies of any financial statements and other documents delivered to such holder,
or from disclosing any other information disclosed to such holder, by or on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with or pursuant to this
Agreement, to any of the following: (i) such holder's directors, officers,
employees, agents and professional consultants, (ii) any other holder of any
Note, (iii) any Person to which such holder offers to sell such Note or any part
thereof, (iv) any Person to which such holder sells or offers to sell a
participation in all or any part of such Note, (v) any Person from which such
holder offers to purchase any security of the Company, (vi) any federal or state
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such holder or (vii) any other
Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (1)
in compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such holder,
(2) in response to any subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative
demand, (3) in connection with any litigation to which such holder is a party,
or (4) in order to protect such holder's investment in such Note.

               12.9. Notices. All written communications provided for hereunder
                     -------

charges prepaid) and (i) if to any Purchaser, addressed to such Purchaser at the
address specified for such communications in the Purchaser Schedule attached
hereto, or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have specified to the
Company in writing, (ii) if to any other holder of any Note, addressed to such
other holder at such address as such other holder shall have specified to the
Company in writing or, if any such other holder shall not have so specified an
address to the Company, then addressed to such other holder in care of the last

exclusive judgment (exercised in good faith) of the Person or Persons making
such determination.

               12.12. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND

unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          Instruments) in proportion to the unpaid amounts thereof on the
          relevant Distribution Date; and

          the Grantors or their respective successors or assigns, or to whomever
          may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of
          competent jurisdiction may direct, provided, however, that if any
                                             --------  -------
          Holder shall have notified the Collateral Trustee in writing that a
          claim is pending for which such Holder is entitled to the benefits of
          an indemnification, reimbursement or similar provision under which
          amounts are not yet due but with respect to which any of the Grantors
          continue to be contingently liable, and amounts payable by such
          Grantor with respect thereto are secured by the Trust Estate, the
          Collateral Trustee shall continue to hold the amount specified in such
          notice in the Collateral Account until such Grantor's liability with
          respect thereto is discharged or released to the satisfaction of such
          Holder.

                    (b)  In the event any of the Secured Debt consisting of
     principal is not due and payable on any Distribution Date, the Grantors
     shall be deemed for purposes of the distribution made on such Distribution
     Date to have an obligation to provide cash collateral in the amount of such
     principal, and the amount distributed with respect to such obligation to
     provide cash collateral shall be held by the Indenture Trustee (if with
     respect to the Company Note Obligations) or the Collateral Trustee (if with
     respect to the Holdings Note Obligations), subject to the provisions of
     this Section 4.4(b)), as cash collateral for such Secured Debt. Amounts
          --------------
     held by the Indenture Trustee or the Collateral Trustee as cash collateral
     under this Section 4.4(b) shall be invested in investments of the kinds
                --------------
     referred to in Section 4.3(a) or 4.3(b) having maturities of ninety (90)
                    --------------    ------
     days or less, and interest earned on such investments shall be (i) first,
     applied to interest accruing on the Secured Debt with respect to which such
     cash collateral is held and (ii) second, deposited in the Collateral
     Account.  The amount of any Secured Debt secured by such cash collateral
     shall be reduced by the amount of such cash collateral for purposes of
     calculating the amount of subsequent distributions under Section 4.4(a).
                                                              --------------
     When any Secured Debt secured by cash collateral as provided above becomes
     due and payable, the amount due and payable shall be paid out of such cash
     collateral, up to but not in excess of the percentage of the principal
     amount of other Secured Debt theretofore paid out of distributions from the
     Collateral Account.  The balance of such cash collateral, if any,

                                      19

     shall be deposited in the Collateral Account.

          of Delaware;

                         (v)    this Agreement has been duly executed and
          delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Trust Company and, based
          on the opinion of its counsel, constitutes the legal, valid and
          binding obligation of the Trust Company, enforceable against it in
          accordance with its terms and each other Security Document to which
          the Collateral Trustee is a party has been duly executed and delivered
          by a duly authorized officer of the Collateral Trustee and constitutes
          the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Collateral Trustee,
          enforceable against it in accordance with its terms (assuming the due
          authorization, execution and delivery of each of the Security
          Documents by each of the parties thereto other than the Collateral
          Trustee and that such other Security Documents constitute legal, valid

          Trust Company, threatened actions or proceedings against the
          Collateral Trustee or the Trust Company before any court,
          administrative agency or tribunal which, if determined adversely to
          the Collateral Trustee or the Trust Company, as the case may be, would
          materially adversely affect the ability of the Collateral Trustee or
          the Trust Company, as the case may be, to perform its obligations
          under any of this Agreement or under any Security Document.

                    (b)  The Collateral Trustee shall not be responsible for
     insuring the Trust Estate or for the payment of taxes, charges, assessments
     or Liens upon the Trust Estate or otherwise as to the maintenance of the
     Trust Estate, except that in the event the Collateral Trustee enters into
     possession of a part or all of the Trust Estate, the Collateral Trustee
     shall use reasonable efforts to preserve the part in its possession.

                    (c)  The Collateral Trustee shall not be required to
     ascertain or inquire as to the performance by any of the Grantors of any of
     the covenants or agreements contained herein, in any Security Document or
     in any Debt Instrument. Whenever it is necessary, or in the opinion of the
     Collateral Trustee advisable, for the Collateral Trustee to ascertain the
     amount of Secured Debt then held by a Holder, the Collateral Trustee may
     conclusively rely on a certificate of such Holder as to such amount.

     its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (or ordinary negligence in
     the handling of funds) or breach of any of its representations, warranties
     or covenants set forth herein or in the Security Documents. Without
     limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Trustee shall be
     under no obligation to take any steps necessary to preserve rights in the
     Collateral against any other parties but may do so at its option. The
     Collateral Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will, in its individual
     capacity and at its own cost and expense, promptly take such action as may
     be necessary duly to discharge all Liens on any part of the Collateral, or
     on any properties of the Company assigned, pledged or mortgaged as part of
     the Collateral, which result from claims against it in its individual
     capacity not related to the administration of the Collateral or any other
     transaction under this Agreement or any document included in the
     Collateral.

matters pertaining to such trusts, powers and duties.  The Collateral Trustee
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents,
nominees or attorneys-in-fact selected by it without gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.

          Section 6.4.   Reliance by Collateral Trustee.
                         ------------------------------

     Agreement the Collateral Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that
     a matter be proved or established with respect to any of the Grantors in
     connection with the taking, suffering or omitting of any action hereunder
     by the Collateral Trustee, such matter (unless other evidence in respect
     thereof is herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively
     provided or established by a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the
     Company delivered to the Collateral Trustee, and such certificate shall be
     full warranty to the Collateral Trustee for any action taken, suffered or
     omitted in reliance thereon; subject, however, to the provisions of Section
                                                                         -------

                 (b)     The Collateral Trustee may consult with counsel
     reasonably satisfactory to it, accountants or other experts in connection
     with the fulfillment of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Trustee
     shall be entitled to rely on the opinion of such counsel, accountants or
     other experts in connection with any action taken, omitted to be taken or
     suffered by Collateral Trustee in fulfilling its duties hereunder. The
     Collateral Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions
     concerning the administration of the Trust Estate from the Holders or from
     any court of competent jurisdiction.

     paper or document which it has no reason to believe to be other than
     genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties

     and title of its predecessor or their predecessors, and upon any required
     filing for record the successor Collateral Trustee or Collateral Trustees

                         (iii)  to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement
          any provision herein or in any Security Document which may be

lender(s) shall have no right, title or interest in and to that certain Purchase

respect thereto.  Such amendment shall contain terms and conditions regarding
intercreditor and related matters reflecting the foregoing priority scheme and
otherwise normal and customary in transactions of this nature and reasonably
acceptable to the parties.  Such amendment shall require the consent of a

2.   Registration of Registrable Securities
     --------------------------------------

     (a)  Shelf Registration of Registrable Securities.
          --------------------------------------------

          (i) The Issuer shall (x) prepare and file with the SEC promptly after
the date hereof, but in no event later than the Filing Date, a "shelf"
Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 415 (the "Shelf Registration Statement")
                                                  ----------------------------
covering resales of the Registrable Securities (the "Registration"), (y) use its
                                                     ------------
best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof,
but in no event later than the Effectiveness Date and (z) use its best efforts
to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective until April 12, 2009 or such
shorter period that will terminate when all of the Registrable Securities have
been sold pursuant to a Registration Statement (the "Effectiveness Period").
                                                     --------------------
The Issuer shall provide to each Holder of Registrable Securities copies of the
Prospectus that is a part of the Shelf Registration Statement, notify each such
Holder of Registrable Securities when the Shelf Registration Statement has
become effective and take such

                                       4
<PAGE>

other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the Registrable
Securities. The Issuer shall require a Selling Holder that sells Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to be named as a Selling
Holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, and
any such Selling Holder shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement that
are applicable to such Selling Holder (including certain indemnification rights
and obligations). Each Selling Holder shall deliver information to be used in
connection with the Shelf Registration Statement within the time period set
forth in this Agreement in order to have its Registrable Securities included in
the Shelf Registration Statement.

          (ii) If the Registration, or any Subsequent Registration (as defined
below) ceases to be effective for any time during the Effectiveness Period, the
Issuer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in any event
shall within 30 days of such cessation of effectiveness amend such Registration
Statement in a manner reasonably expected to obtain the withdrawal of the order
suspending the effectiveness thereof, or the Issuer shall use its best efforts
to file an additional "shelf" Registration Statement (a "Subsequent Registration
                                                         -----------------------
Statement") pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Securities (a
---------
"Subsequent Registration") on or prior to 90 days after such cessation of
------------------------
effectiveness and to cause the Subsequent Registration Statement to be declared
effective on or prior to 180 days after such cessation of effectiveness.  Upon a
Subsequent Registration Statement being declared effective, the Issuer shall use
its best efforts to keep such Subsequent Registration Statement continuously
effective for a period equal to the number of days in the Effectiveness Period
less the aggregate number of days during which the Registration Statement, and
any Subsequent Registration, was previously effective.

     (b)  Piggy-Back Registration of Registrable Warrant Shares.
          -----------------------------------------------------

          (i) If at any time after the Closing Date and prior to the Filing Date
the Issuer proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act
with respect to an offering by the Issuer for its own account or for the account
of any holders of its Common Stock (other than (x) a registration statement on
Form S-4 or Form S-8 (or any substitute form that may be adopted by the SEC) or
(y) a registration statement filed in connection with an exchange offer or
offering of securities solely to the Issuer's existing security holders), then
the Issuer shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the Holders of
Registrable Shares as soon as practicable (but in no event fewer than 30 days
before the anticipated filing date), and such notice shall offer such Holders
the opportunity to register such number of Registrable Shares as each Holder of
Registrable Shares may request in writing within 20 days after receipt of such
written notice from the Issuer (which request shall specify the Registrable
Shares intended to be disposed of by such Selling Holder and the intended method
of distribution thereof) (a "Piggy-Back Registration").  The Issuer shall use
                             -----------------------
its best efforts to keep such Piggy-Back Registration continuously effective
under the Securities Act until at least the earlier of (x) the end of the
Effectiveness Period or (y) the consummation of the distribution by the Selling
Holders of all of the Registrable Shares covered thereby.  The Issuer shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters, if
any, of such proposed offering to permit the Registrable Shares requested to be
included in a Piggy-Back Registration to be included on the same terms and
conditions as any

                                       5
<PAGE>

similar securities of the Issuer or any other security holder included therein
and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Shares in
accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof.

          (ii)  Priority in Piggy-Back Registration.  In a registration pursuant
                -----------------------------------
to this Section 2(b) involving an underwritten offering, if the managing
        ------------
underwriter or underwriters of such underwritten offering have informed, in
writing, the Issuer and the Selling Holders requesting inclusion in such
offering that in such underwriter's or underwriters' opinion the total number of
securities which the Issuer, the Selling Holders and any other Persons desiring
to participate in such registration intend to include in such offering is such
as to adversely affect the success of such offering, including the price at
which such securities can be sold, then the Issuer will be required to include
in such registration only the amount of securities which it is so advised should
be included in such registration.  In such event: (x) in cases initially
involving the registration for sale of securities for the Issuer's own account,
securities shall be registered in such offering in the following order of
priority: (i) first, the securities which the Issuer proposes to register, (ii)
second, provided that no securities proposed to be registered by the Issuer have
been excluded from such registration, the securities that have been requested to
be included in such registration by the Selling Holders, and (iii) third,
provided that no securities sought to be included by the Selling Holders have
been excluded from such registration, the securities of other Persons entitled
to exercise "piggy-back" registration rights pursuant to contractual commitments
of the Issuer (pro rata based on the amount of securities sought to be
registered by such Persons); and (y) in cases not initially involving the
registration for sale of securities for the Issuer's own account, securities
shall be registered in such offering in the following order of priority: (i)
first, the securities of any Person whose exercise of a "demand" registration
right pursuant to a contractual commitment of the Issuer is the basis for the
registration, (ii) second, provided that no securities of any Person whose
exercise of a "demand" registration right pursuant to a contractual commitment
of the Issuer is the basis for such registration have been excluded from such
registration, the securities requested to be included in such registration by
the Selling Holders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) third, provided that no
securities sought to be included by the Selling Holders or such Persons have
been excluded from such registration, securities of other Persons entitled to
exercise "piggy-back" registration rights pursuant to contractual commitments of
the Issuer (pro rata based on the amount of securities sought be registered by
such Persons) and (iv) fourth, provided that no securities sought to be included
by other Persons entitled to exercise "piggy-back" registration rights pursuant
to such contractual commitments have been excluded from such registration, any
securities which the Issuer proposes to register.

          (iii) Suspension of Sales, etc.  During any consecutive 365-day
                -------------------------
period, the Issuer shall be entitled to suspend the availability of the Piggy-
Back Registration for up to two 45 consecutive-day periods (except during the 45
consecutive-day period immediately prior to the Expiration Date) if the Board of
Directors of the Issuer determines in good faith that the effectiveness of, or
sales pursuant to, such Piggy-Back Registration would materially impede, delay
or interfere with any significant financing, offer or sale of securities,
acquisition, corporate reorganization or other significant transaction involving
the Issuer or any of its affiliates.  If the Issuer shall so postpone the
effectiveness of, or suspend the rights of any Selling Holders to make

                                       6
<PAGE>

sales pursuant to, a Piggy-Back Registration, it shall, as promptly as possible,
notify any Selling Holders of such determination, and the Selling Holders shall
(y) have the right, in the case of a postponement of the effectiveness of a
Piggy-Back Registration, upon the affirmative vote of Selling Holders of not
less than a majority of the Registrable Warrant Shares to be included in such
Piggy-Back Registration, to withdraw the request for registration by giving
written notice to the Issuer within 20 days after receipt of such notice or (z)
in the case of a suspension of the right to make sales, receive an extension of
the registration period referred to in Section 2(a) hereof equal to the number
                                       ------------
of days of the suspension.

          (iv) Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request
for inclusion of its Registrable Shares in any Piggy-Back Registration pursuant
to this Section 2(b) by giving written notice to the Issuer of its request to
        ------------
withdraw at any time prior to the filing of such Piggy-Back Registration with
the SEC.  The Issuer will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each
registration of Registrable Shares requested pursuant to this Section 2(b), and
                                                              ------------
each Holder of Registrable Shares shall pay all underwriting discounts and
commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of
the Registrable Shares of such Holder of Registrable Shares pursuant to a Piggy-
Back Registration effected pursuant to this Section 2(b).
                                            ------------

          (v)  Exclusion of Registrable Shares. The Issuer shall not be required
               -------------------------------
by this Section 2(b) to include Registrable Shares in a Piggy-Back Registration
        ------------
if (i) in the written opinion of outside counsel to the Issuer, addressed to the
holders of Registrable Shares and delivered to them, the Holders of such
Registrable Shares seeking registration would be free to sell all such
Registrable Shares within the current calendar quarter without registration
under Rule 144, which opinion may be based in part upon the representation by
the Holders of such Registrable Shares seeking registration, which
representation shall not be unreasonably withheld, that each such Holder is not
an affiliate of the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act, and (ii)
all requirements under the Securities Act for effecting such sales are satisfied
at such time.

          (vi) No Special Audit.  The Issuer shall not be obligated to cause any
               ----------------
special audit to be undertaken in connection with any Piggy-Back Registration
unless such audit is requested by the underwriters with respect to such Piggy-
Back Registration or, if such Piggy-Back Registration does not involve an
underwritten offering, by the Selling Holders of not less than a majority of the
Registrable Shares to be included in such Piggy Back Registration.

     (c)  Obligations of Selling Holders. The Issuer's obligations under this
          ------------------------------
Section 2 shall be subject to the obligations of the Selling Holders, which the
---------
Selling Holders hereby acknowledge, to furnish all information and materials and
to take any and all actions as may be required under applicable requirements of
the SEC and to obtain an acceleration of the effective date of a Registration
Statement.

     (d)  Listing. The Issuer covenants and agrees to (i) list all Convertible
          -------
Shares issued or issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes and all
Warrant Shares issued or issuable upon exercise of the Warrants on the American
Stock Exchange or any other securities exchange on which the Common Stock is
then listed or (ii) authorize for quotation on the National

National Market System of NASDAQ all Common Stock issued or issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Notes or exercise of the Warrants if the Common
Stock is then so authorized for quotation.

3.  Registration Expenses.  Except as set forth in Section 2(b)(iv), all fees
    ---------------------                          ----------------
and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with this Agreement
(the "Registration Expenses") shall be borne by the Issuer, whether or not a
      ---------------------
Registration Statement is filed or becomes effective, including, without
limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees, including, without limitation,
(A) fees with respect to filings required to be made with the NASD in connection
with any underwritten offering and (B) fees and expenses of compliance with
state securities or Blue Sky laws, (ii) printing expenses, including, without
limitation, expenses of printing Prospectuses if the printing of Prospectuses is

without limitation, all salaries and expenses of officers and employees of the
Issuer performing legal or accounting duties), (ix) the expense of any annual

relating to printing, word processing and distributing all Registration
Statements, underwriting agreements, securities sales agreements, indentures and
any other documents necessary in order to comply with this Agreement; provided,
                                                                      --------
however, that in the case of any underwritten offering, in no event shall the
-------
Issuer be responsible for any underwriting discounts and commissions.

4.  Indemnification
    ---------------

    (a) Indemnification by the Issuer. The Issuer shall without limitation as to
        ----------------------------
time, indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities, each
Person, if any, who controls each such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act) and the officers,
directors and partners of each such Holder and controlling person, to the
fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable costs of
preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements as provided in this
Section 4) and expenses (including, without limitation, costs and expenses
---------
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending
against any of the foregoing) (collectively, "Losses"), as incurred, directly or
                                              ------
indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection
with any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto,
or in any preliminary prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except insofar as such Losses are solely based upon information
relating to such Holder and furnished in writing to the Issuer by such Holder or
its counsel expressly for use therein;

                                       8
<PAGE>

provided, however, that the Issuer will not be liable to any Indemnified Party
--------  -------
under this Section 4 to the extent Losses were solely caused by an untrue
           ---------
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that was contained
or made in any preliminary prospectus and corrected in the Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto if (i) the Prospectus does not contain any other
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a
material fact that was the subject matter of the related proceeding, (ii) any
such Losses resulted from an action, claim or suit by any Person who purchased
Registrable Securities which are the subject thereof from such Indemnified Party
and (iii) it is established in a related proceeding that such Indemnified Party
failed to deliver or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or
supplemented) to such Person with or prior to the confirmation of the sale of
such Registrable Securities sold to such Person if required by applicable law,
unless such failure to deliver or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended
or supplemented) was a result of noncompliance by the Issuer with this
Agreement. The Issuer shall also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer
managers and similar securities industry professionals participating in the
distribution, their officers, directors, agents and employees and each Person
who controls such Persons (within the meaning of Section 5 of the Securities Act
or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with
respect to the indemnification of the Holders.

     (b)  Indemnification by Holders.  In connection with any Registration
          --------------------------
Statement, Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary
prospectus in which a Holder is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Issuer in writing such information as the Issuer reasonably requests for use in
connection with any Registration Statement, Prospectus, any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus and shall, without limitation
as to time, indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, its directors and each
Person, if any, who controls the Issuer (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act), and the directors,
officers, employees, agents, and partners of such controlling persons, to the
fullest extent lawful, from and against all Losses arising out of or based upon
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or
in any preliminary prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Losses are
finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which
determination is not subject to appeal) to have resulted solely from an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from any information so
furnished in writing by such Holder to the Issuer expressly for use therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the liability of any selling
Holder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of
payment of all expenses) received by such Holder upon the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

     (c)  Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings.  If any Proceeding shall be
          --------------------------------------
brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the party or
 -----------------
parties from which such indemnity is sought (an

                                       9
<PAGE>

"Indemnifying Party") in writing; provided, that the failure to so notify the
 ------------------               --------
Indemnifying Parties shall not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from any
obligation or liability except to the extent (but only to the extent) that it
shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which
determination is not subject to appeal) that the Indemnifying Parties have been
prejudiced materially by such failure.

          The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by giving
written notice to an Indemnified Party, within 20 Business Days after receipt of
written notice from such Indemnified Party of such Proceeding, to assume, at its
expense, the defense of any such Proceeding, provided, that an Indemnified Party
                                             --------
shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or parties unless: (1) the
Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses; or (2) the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such
Proceeding or shall have failed to employ counsel satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party; or (3) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including
any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party or any of its affiliates or controlling persons, and such Indemnified
Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more defenses
available to such Indemnified Party that are in addition to, or in conflict
with, those defenses available to the Indemnifying Party or such affiliate or
controlling person (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the
Indemnifying Parties in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall not have the
right to assume the defense and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; it being understood, however,
that, the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such
Proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related Proceedings in the
same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances,
be liable for the fees and expenses or more than one separate firm of attorneys
(together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for such Indemnified
Party).

          No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement of any such
Proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final
judgment for the plaintiff in any such Proceeding, each Indemnifying Party
jointly and severally agrees, subject to the exceptions and limitations set
forth above, to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and
against any and all Losses by reason of such settlement or judgment.  The
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all liability in respect
of such Proceeding for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party
thereto).

          (d)  Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for in this
               ------------
Section 4 is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold such
---------
Indemnified Party harmless for any Losses in respect of which this Section 4
                                                                   ---------
would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of

                                      10
<PAGE>

exceptions provided in this Section 4), then each applicable Indemnifying Party,
                            ---------
in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall have a joint and several
obligation to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party
as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and such Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, in connection with the actions, statements or
omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party, on the one hand,
and Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent any such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by
an Indemnified Party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include any
legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any
Proceeding, to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees
or expenses if the indemnification provided for in Section 4(a) or 4(b) was
                                                   ------------    ----
available to such party.

     The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 4(d) were determined by pro rata
                              ------------
allocation or by other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4(d), a selling Holder shall not
                                       ------------
be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of such
Holder's Maximum Contribution Amount. A selling Holder's "Maximum Contribution
                                                          --------------------
Amount" shall equal the excess of (i) the aggregate net proceeds received by
------
such Holder pursuant to the sale of such Registrable Securities over (ii) the
aggregate amount of damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

     The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 4 are
                                                                 ---------
in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the
Indemnified Parties.

5.   Liquidated Damages
     ------------------

     (a) The Issuer acknowledges and agrees that the Holders of Registrable
Securities will suffer damages, and that it would not be feasible to ascertain
the extent of such damages with precision, if the Issuer fails to fulfill its
obligation hereunder.  Accordingly, in the event of such failure, the Issuer
agrees to pay liquidated damages to each Holder of Registrable Securities under
the circumstances and to the extent set forth below:

          (i)  if the Issuer fails to file any required Registration Statement
on or prior to the Filing Date; or

          (ii) if any required Registration Statement is not declared effective
by the SEC on or

                                      11
<PAGE>

prior to the Effectiveness Date;

          (iii)  if a Registration Statement is filed and declared effective by
the SEC but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with the
resale of the Registrable Securities without being succeeded within 30 days by a
Subsequent Registration Statement filed and declared effective;

(each of the foregoing a "Registration Default").
                          --------------------

     Upon occurrence of any Registration Default, the Issuer shall pay, or cause
to be paid to each Holder of Registrable Securities $.033 per Warrant Share for
each 90-day period (or portion thereof) after the occurrence of a Registration
Default as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, for each Registrable
Security owned by such Holder.

     (b)  Notwithstanding Section 5(a) of this Agreement, the Issuer shall not
                          ------------
be required to pay Liquidated Damages to a Holder of Registrable Securities with
respect to the Registrable Securities held by such Holder (1) to the extent such
Registrable Securities are comprised of the Convertible Notes, the Convertible
Shares or any other securities issued or issuable with respect to any
Convertible Shares by way of stock dividends or stock splits or in connection
with a combination of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other
reorganization or otherwise or (2) if the Registration Default arises by reason
of the failure of such Holder to provide information that (i) the Issuer may
reasonably request, with reasonable prior notice, for use in the Registration
Statement or any prospectus included therein to the extent the Issuer reasonably
determines that such information is required to be included therein by
applicable law or (ii) the SEC may request in connection with such Registration
Statement (but only to the extent that such compliance is necessary for the
Registration Statement to be declared effective).

6.   Miscellaneous
     -------------

     (a)  No Inconsistent Agreements.  The Issuer has not entered, as of the
          --------------------------
date hereof, and the Issuer shall not enter, after the date of this Agreement,
into any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent
with the rights granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this
Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 6(a) attached hereto, the Issuer has not entered into any
agreement with respect to any of its securities which will grant to any Person
piggy-back rights with respect to a Registration Statement.  The Issuer will not
enter into any agreement with respect to any of its securities which will grant
to any Person piggy-back rights that are senior to the rights granted to the
Holders under this Agreement with respect to a Registration Statement.

     (b)  Adjustments Affecting Registrable Securities. The Issuer shall not,
          --------------------------------------------
directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Registrable
Securities that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders to include
such Registrable Securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement.

     (c)  Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be
          ----------------------
amended,

                                      12
<PAGE>

modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the
provisions hereof may not be given, otherwise than with the prior written
consent of (A) in circumstances that would adversely affect any Holders, the
Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities (treating as outstanding for
this purpose Warrant Shares issuable on exercise of unexercised Warrants and
Convertible Shares issuable on conversion of outstanding Convertible Notes);
provided, however, that Section 4 and this Section 6(c) may not be amended,
--------  -------       ---------          ------------
modified or supplemented without the prior written consent of each Holder
(including any Holder of Registrable Securities disposed of pursuant to any
Registration Statement).

                      provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither

                      than that of the principal;

     (b)       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other
               provision hereof, Airways hereby waives, to the fullest extent
               permitted by applicable law in accordance with Section 2856 of
               the California Civil Code, all rights and benefits under
               California Civil Code Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive (or any
               similar laws in other jurisdictions) and all rights and benefits
               of California Civil Code Sections 2899 and 3433 (or any similar
               laws in any other jurisdiction). In addition, without limiting
               the generality of the foregoing or any other provision hereof,
               Airways hereby waives, in accordance with Section 2856 of the
               California Civil Code, all rights and defenses (including,
               without limitation, all rights and defenses arising out of an
               election of remedies by the Collateral Trustee or any Holder)
               that Airways may have because the Additional Secured Obligations
               are secured by real property. This means, among other things:

               (i)    any Holder may act against Airways under the Collateral
                      Trust Agreement without first foreclosing on any real or
                      personal property collateral pledged to or for the benefit
                      of the Collateral Trustee or any Holder; and

               (ii)   if any Holder forecloses on any real property collateral
                      pledged by the Company:

                      (A)    the amount of the debt may be reduced only by the
                             price for which that collateral is sold at the
                             foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth
                             more than the sale price; and

                      (B)    any Holder may collect from Airways even if any
                             Holder, by foreclosing on the real property
                             collateral, has destroyed any right Airways may
                             have to collect from the Company.

This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses
Airways may have because the Additional Secured Obligations are secured by real
property.  These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights
or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the California Code of
Civil Procedure (or any similar laws in any other jurisdiction).  In accordance
with Section 16 below, this Agreement shall be governed by, and shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws (as opposed to the
conflicts

                                       4
<PAGE>

of laws provisions other than those contained in New York General Obligations
Law Section 5-1401) and decisions of the State of New York. This Section 4(b)
and other referenced provisions of California law are included solely out of an
abundance of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the
referenced provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this
Agreement or to any of the Additional Secured Obligations.

     (c)  The Holders are hereby authorized, without notice or demand and
          without affecting the liability of Airways hereunder, from time to
          time, (i) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time
          for payment of, or other terms relating to, all or any part of the
          Additional Secured Obligations, or to otherwise modify, amend or
          change the terms of any of the Transaction Documents; (ii) to accept
          partial payments on all or any part of the Additional Secured
          Obligations; (iii) to take and hold security or collateral for the
          payment of all or any part of the Additional Secured Obligations, this
          Agreement, or any other guaranties of all or any part of the
          Additional Secured Obligations or other liabilities of the Company,
          (iv) to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security,
          collateral or guaranties; (v) to apply such security or collateral and
          direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in their reasonable
          discretion they may determine; and (vi) to settle, release, exchange,
          enforce, waive, compromise or collect or otherwise liquidate all or
          any part of the Additional Secured Obligations, this Agreement, any
          other guaranty of all or any part of the Additional Secured
          Obligations, and any security or collateral for the Additional Secured
          Obligations or for any such guaranty. Any of the foregoing may be done
          in any manner, without affecting or impairing the Obligations of
          Airways hereunder.

     5.   Representations and Warranties.  Airways hereby represents and
          ------------------------------
warrants to the Holders that each of the following statements is true, correct

          business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where it
          presently is, or proposes to be, engaged in business, except in

          good standing has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have
          a Material Adverse Effect;

     (b)  Airways has all requisite power and authority to enter into, deliver
          and perform its obligations under each of the Transaction Documents to
          which it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated

          and performance by Airways of any of the Transaction Documents has
          been taken;

     (c)  Each of the Transaction Documents to which Airways is a party has been
          duly authorized by Airways, and this Agreement is, and, when executed

          valid and binding obligation of Airways, enforceable in accordance
          with its terms, except that the enforcement thereof may be subject to
          (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium,
          fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
          relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of
          equity (whether applied by a court of law or equity) and the
          discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
          brought.

     (d)  Airways is not in violation of its certificate of incorporation or
          bylaws (the "Charter Documents"). The Guarantor is not (i) in
          violation of any Federal, state, local or foreign statute, law
          (including, without limitation, common law) or ordinance, or any

          Law") of any Governmental Authority other than as disclosed in the

          expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There exists no condition
          that, with the passage of time or otherwise, would (i) constitute a
          violation of such Charter Documents or Applicable Laws, (ii)
          constitute a breach of or default under any Applicable Agreement or
          (iii) result in the imposition of any penalty or the acceleration of

          valid and binding obligations, and no default has occurred or is
          continuing thereunder, other than such defaults that could not, singly
          or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
          Effect.

     (f)  No consent, authorization, permit, notice or filing is required in
          connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
          Agreement, any Transaction Document to which Airways is a party or the
          continuing operations of Airways, except (i) those that have been
          obtained or made and (ii) filings necessary to create, perfect or
          retain the perfection or priority of Liens of the Holders against the
          Collateral.

     (g)  The representations and warranties of Airways contained in the
          Transaction Documents to which it is a party are true and correct.

     (h)  Airways has validly submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
          State of New York and the federal courts located in the City of New
          York.

     (i)  The choice of law of the State of New York to govern this Agreement is
          valid under the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of Airways,
          and a court in such

                                       6
<PAGE>

          jurisdiction would uphold such choice of law in any suit on this
          Agreement brought in such court.

     6.   Setoff.  In addition to and not in limitation of all rights of
          ------
offset that any Holder may have under applicable law, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, and whether or not any Holder
has made any demand or the Additional Secured Obligations of the Company or
Airways have matured, each Holder shall have the right to appropriate and apply
to the payment of the Additional Secured Obligations (a) all deposits and other
obligations then or thereafter owing by such Holder to Airways and (b) any
moneys, credits or other property belonging to Airways, at any time held by or
coming into the possession of such Holder or any of its Affiliates in each case
to the extent the same are the subject of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

     7.   Financial Information. The Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for
          ---------------------
keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Company an d any and
all endorsers and/or guarantors of all or any part of the Additional Secured
Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of non-payment
of the Additional Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent
inquiry would reveal, and Airways hereby agrees that none of the Holders shall
have any duty to advise Airways of information known to any of them regarding
such condition or any such circumstances. In the event that any Holder, in its
sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such
information to Airways, such Holder shall be under no obligation (a) to
undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (b) to
disclose any information which such Holder, pursuant to accepted or reasonable
commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (c)
to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other
information to Airways.

     8.   No Marshaling; Reinstatement. The Guarantor consents and agrees that
          ----------------------------
none of the Holders shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor
of Airways or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the
Additional Secured Obligations. The Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent
that the Company, Airways or any guarantor of all or any part of the Additional
Secured Obligations makes a payment or payments to any Holder, or such Holder
receives any proceeds of Collateral, which payment or payments or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside and/or required to be repaid to the Company, Airways such other
guarantor, or any other Person, or their respective estates, trustees, receivers
or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the part of
the Additional Secured Obligations which has been paid, reduced or satisfied by
such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full force and effect as of the
time immediately preceding such initial payment, reduction or satisfaction as if
such payment or repayment had not been made. The Guarantor hereby agrees that it
will indemnify the Holders on demand for all costs and expenses (including
without limitation reasonable legal fees) incurred by such parties in connection
with such return of a payment or of Collateral proceeds by the Holder.

     9.   Subrogation, Contribution, Etc.  Until the Additional Secured
          ------------------------------
Obligations have been paid in full in cash, Airways hereby agrees not to assert
(a) any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that Airways now has or may
hereafter have against the Company or any of its

                                       7
<PAGE>

assets in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder, in each
case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by
statute (including, without limitation, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code
or Section 2847, 2848 or 2849 of the California Civil Code), under common law or
otherwise and including without limitation (i) any right of subrogation,
reimbursement or indemnification that Airways now has or may hereafter have
against the Company, (ii) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim,
right or remedy that any Holder now has of may hereafter have against the
Company and (iii) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any
collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Holder, and (b) any right of
contribution Airways may have against any guarantor of all or any part of the
Additional Secured Obligations (including, without limitation, any such right of
contribution under Section 2848 of the California Civil Code). The Guarantor
further agrees that, to the extent the foregoing agreement with respect to its
rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set
forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or
voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification Airways may have against the Company or against any collateral
or security, and any rights of contribution Airways may have against any
guarantor, shall be subordinated to the payment of the Additional Secured
Obligations as set forth in Section 10.

     10.  Subordination.  Airways agrees that any and all claims of Airways
          -------------
against the Company, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the
Additional Secured Obligations, or against any of their respective properties,
shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment, in
full and in cash, of all Additional Secured Obligations; provided, that the
Company may make payments to the Airways at any time or times when the Company
does not have any outstanding Additional Secured Obligations which are then due
and payable.  Notwithstanding any right of Airways to ask, demand, sue for, take
or receive any payment from the Company, all rights, liens and security
interests of Airways, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing,
in any assets of the Company (whether constituting part of the security or
collateral given to any Holder to secure payment of all or any part of the
Additional Secured Obligations or otherwise) shall be and hereby are
subordinated to the rights of the Holders in those assets.  Except as permitted
by the Note Agreement, Airways shall have no right to possession of any such
asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or
otherwise, unless and until all of the Additional Secured Obligations shall have
been fully performed or paid in cash.  If all or any part of the assets of the
Company, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or
application to the creditors of the Company, whether partial or complete,
voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy,
arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other
action or proceeding, or if the business of the Company is dissolved or if
(except as permitted by the Note Agreement) substantially all of the assets of
the Company are sold, then, and in any such event, any payment or distribution
of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which
shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any Indebtedness of the
Company to Airways ("Company Indebtedness") shall be paid or delivered directly
to the Holders for application on any of the Additional Secured Obligations, due
or to become due, until the Additional Secured Obligations shall have first been
fully paid in cash.  Airways irrevocably authorizes and empowers each Holder to
demand, sue for, collect and receive every such payment or distribution and give
acquittance therefor and to make and present for and on

                                       8
<PAGE>

behalf of Airways such proofs of claim and take such other action, in the
Holder's own name or in the name of Airways or otherwise, as such Holder may
deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of this Agreement. Each Holder
may vote such proofs of claim in any such proceeding, receive and collect any
and all dividends or other payments or disbursements made on Company
Indebtedness in whatever form the same may be paid or issued and apply the same
on account of any of the Additional Secured Obligations. Subject to the provisos
to the first sentence of this Section 10, should any payment, distribution,
security or instrument or proceeds thereof be received by Airways upon or with
respect to the Company Indebtedness prior to the performance or payment in full
in cash of all of the Additional Secured Obligations, Airways shall receive and
hold the same in trust, as trustee, for the benefit of the Holders, and shall
forthwith deliver the same to the Holders, in precisely the form received
(except for the endorsement or assignment of Airways where necessary), for
application to any of the Additional Secured Obligations, due or not due, and,
until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by Airways as the property
of the Holders. If Airways fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to
the Holders, the Required Holders or any of their respective officers or
employees are hereby irrevocably authorized to make the same. Airways agrees
that until the Additional Secured Obligations have been performed and paid in
full in cash, Airways will not assign or transfer to any Person any claim
Airways has or may have against the Company.

          11.  Enforcement; Amendments; Waivers.  No delay on the part of any of
               --------------------------------
the Holders  in the exercise of any right or remedy arising under this
Agreement, the Note Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or
otherwise with respect to all or any part of the Additional Secured Obligations,
the Collateral or any other guaranty of or security for all or any part of the
Additional Secured Obligations shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single
or partial exercise by any such Person of any such right or remedy shall
preclude any further exercise thereof.  No modification or waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon the Holders, except for such
modifications and waivers made in accordance with the Note Agreement.  Failure
by any of the Holders at any time or times hereafter to require strict
performance by the Company, Airways, any guarantor of all or any part of the
Additional Secured Obligations or any other Person of any of the provisions,
warranties, terms and conditions contained in any of the Transaction Documents
now or at any time or times hereafter executed by such Persons and delivered to
any Holder shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of such Holder at any
time or times hereafter to demand strict performance thereof and such right
shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of any Holder,
or their respective agents, officers or employees, unless such waiver is
contained in an instrument in writing, directed and delivered to the Company or
Airways, as applicable, specifying such waiver, and is signed by the party or
parties necessary to give such waiver under the Note Agreement.  No waiver of
any Event of Default by any Holder shall operate as a waiver of any other Event
of Default or the same Event of Default on a future occasion, and no action by
any Holder permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair any Holder's
rights and remedies or the Additional Secured Obligations of Airways under this
Agreement.  Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount
of any principal and/or interest owing by the Company to the any of the Holders
shall be conclusive and binding on Airways irrespective of whether Airways was a
party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.

          12.  Effectiveness; Termination.  This Agreement shall become
               --------------------------
effective upon its

                                       9
<PAGE>

execution by Airways and shall continue in full force and effect and may not be
terminated or otherwise revoked until the Additional Secured Obligations shall
have been fully performed or paid in cash (except to the extent Airways is
released from its Additional Secured Obligations hereunder in accordance with
the Note Agreement). The Guarantor hereby expressly waives the benefits of
Section 2815 of the California Civil Code (or any similar law in any other
jurisdiction) purporting to allow a guarantor to revoke a continuing guaranty
with respect to any transactions occurring after the date of the guaranty. If,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Airways shall have any right under applicable law
to terminate or revoke its obligations under this Agreement, Airways agrees that
such termination or revocation shall not be effective until a written notice of
such revocation or termination, specifically referring hereto, signed by
Airways, is actually received by the Holders. Such notice shall not affect the
right and power of any Holder to enforce rights arising prior to receipt thereof
by the Holders. If any Holder grants any accommodations or takes other action
after Airways terminates or revokes this Agreement but before such Holder
receives such written notice, the rights of such Holder with respect thereto
shall be the same as if such termination or revocation had not occurred.

     13.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon
          ----------------------
Airways and upon its successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the
benefit of the Holders and their respective successors and permitted assigns
under the Note Agreement; all references herein to the Company and to Airways
shall be deemed to include their respective successors and assigns.  The
successors of Airways and the Company shall include, without limitation, their
respective receivers, trustees or debtors-in-possession.

     14.  Advice of Counsel.  Airways represents and warrants that it has
          -----------------
consulted with its legal counsel regarding all waivers under this Agreement,
including without limitation those under Section 4 and Sections 16 through 19
hereof, that it believes that it fully understands all rights that it is waiving
and the effect of such waivers, that it assumes the risk of any misunderstanding
that it may have regarding any of the foregoing, and that it intends that such
waivers shall be a material inducement to the Holders to extend the indebtedness
guaranteed hereby.

               -----------------------

Airways and 717 Leasing and certificates of public officials. We also have
assumed (i) the valid authorization, execution, and delivery of the Transaction
Documents by all parties thereto (other than Holdings and Airways), (ii) that
except as expressly set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 below, each party to the
Transaction Documents is validly existing and is in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization with the corporate or other
organizational power to perform its obligations thereunder, (iii) that each of
the Transaction Documents constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each party thereto (other than Holdings, Airways or 717 Leasing), enforceable
against each such other party in accordance with its terms, (iv) that all
parties to the Transaction Documents will at all times act in a commercially
reasonable manner, in good faith and in compliance with the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, (v) that the Mortgage and any Financing Statements
give a correct address of the Collateral Trustee from which information
concerning the purported security interest perfected thereby may be obtained,
(vi) that Airways has rights in the Mortgaged Property in which Airways purports
to grant a security interest to the Collateral Trustee, and (vii) that each of
Airways, Holdings, 717 Leasing has rights in the Collateral in which such party
purports to grant a security interest to the Collateral Trustee under any
Transaction Documents.

          Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is
our opinion that, as of the date hereof:

     1.   Holdings is validly existing and in good standing under the Nevada
Revised Statutes (the "NRS"). As used in this paragraph, "good standing" means
                       ---
that all required filings and registrations have been made under the applicable
filing and annual registration provisions of the NRS and that any filing fees
due and payable thereunder have been paid. Holdings has the corporate power and
authority (i) to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its
business as described in the Holdings SEC Documents and the Purchase Agreement,
(ii) to execute, deliver and perform the Purchase Agreement, Holdings Note
Agreement, the Warrant and Convertible Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the
Warrant Agreement, and the Collateral Documents to which it is a party and (iii)
to issue, deliver and sell the Holdings Series A Notes and the Holdings Series B
Notes as contemplated by the Holdings Note Agreement and the Warrants as
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.

     2.   Airways is validly existing and in good standing under the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). As used in this paragraph, "good standing"
                              ----
means that all required filings and registrations have been made under the
applicable filing and annual registration provisions of the DGCL and that any
filing fees due and payable thereunder have been paid. Airways has the corporate
power and authority (i) to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct
its business as described in the Holdings SEC Documents, the Purchase Agreement
and the Indenture, (ii) to execute, deliver and perform the Purchase Agreement,
Indenture, the Note Registration Rights Agreement, the Collateral Documents to
which it is a party, the Collateral

   Support Agreement, and (iii) to issue, deliver and sell the Series A Notes as
   contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture.

     3.   Each of Holdings and Airways is in good standing in each jurisdiction
identified on Schedule B hereto, which are those jurisdictions identified to us
by Holdings and Airways as jurisdictions where the ownership, leasing or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have,
singly or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (taking into account in
determining materiality, the opinions of officers and other representatives of
Holdings and Airways). As used in this paragraph, "good standing" means that all
required filings and registrations have been made under the applicable filing
and annual registration provisions of the applicable business corporation
statutes and that any filing fees due and payable thereunder have been paid.

     4.   The capitalization of Holdings is as follows:

          Preferred Stock.  Five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock,
          ---------------
     and, to the best of our knowledge, none of such shares of preferred stock
     have been issued prior to the date hereof; and

          Common Stock.  One billion (1,000,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par
          ------------
     value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001) per share (the "Common Stock"), and,
                                                            ------------
     to the best of our knowledge,  66,583,000 shares of such Common Stock , as
     of March 31, 2001, were issued and are outstanding.

     5.   To the best of our knowledge, all of the issued and outstanding shares
of capital stock of Airways have been duly and validly authorized and are fully
paid and nonassessable, and are owned by Holdings, directly or indirectly, free
and clear of any Lien.

     6.   To the best of our knowledge, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
rights, warrants, options, calls, convertible securities, commitments for sale
or Liens related to or entitling any person to purchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of the capital stock of, or other ownership interest in Holdings or
Airways other than the Warrants, the Holdings Series B Notes and as disclosed in
the Holdings SEC Documents (except for subsequent issuances, if any, as
contemplated by employee stock options and benefit plans referred to in the
Holdings SEC Documents).

     7.   No authorization, approval, consent or order of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority of the State of New York, the United States (other than
as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states,
as to which we express no opinion), or under the DGCL or the NRS is required for
the issuance and sale of the Series A Notes, Warrants,

   Holdings Series A Notes or Holdings Series B Notes pursuant to the Purchase
   Agreement, the Warrant Agreement or the Holdings Note Agreement,
   respectively.

     8.   Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Airways,
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Indenture
Trustee, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Airways, enforceable
against Airways in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
relating to fraudulent conveyances and transfers), reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as
enforcement is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (which
limitations are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Enforceability
                                                             --------------

"Securities Act"), is required and (ii) no qualification of the Indenture under
 --------------
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "TIA"), is required, in each
                                                  ---
case in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the Holdings Series A
Notes, the Holdings Series B Notes, Collateral Support Agreement, the Series A

     23.  Neither the execution and delivery by Airways of the Transaction

transactions contemplated thereby: (a) violates Airway's Charter Documents, (b)
violates any law or regulation (including any applicable order or decree of any
Governmental Authority) of the United States or of the State of New York, known
to us as applicable to Airways, the violation of which would result in a
Material Adverse Effect (taking into account in determining materiality, the
opinions of officers and other representatives of Airways); (c) to the best of
our knowledge, conflicts with or results in the breach or termination of,
constitutes a default under or accelerates or permits the acceleration of any
performance required by any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, agreement
or other instrument known to us to which Airways is a party or by which Airways
or
<PAGE>

Page 8


     any of the property of Airways is bound; (d) to the best of our knowledge,
     results in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets of
     Airways (except for the Liens created by the Transaction Documents,
     Permitted Liens and Identified Liens); or (e) requires the consent or
     approval of, or, except for (A) the filings referred to in paragraph 27
     hereof and (B) the filing of the Aircraft Mortgage and Security Agreement
     in the aircraft registry maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration
     in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, any filing or registration with, any
     Governmental Authority of the United States or of the State of New York.

       24.  Neither the execution and delivery by Holdings of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, nor the consummation by Holdings of the
transactions contemplated thereby: (a) violates Holding's Charter Documents, (b)
violates any law or regulation (including any applicable order or decree of any
Governmental Authority) of the United States or of the State of New York, known
to us as applicable to Holdings, the violation of which would result in a
Material Adverse Effect (taking into account in determining materiality, the
opinions of officers and other representatives of Holdings); (c) to the best of
our knowledge, conflicts with or results in the breach or termination of,
constitutes a default under or accelerates or permits the acceleration of any
performance required by any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, agreement
or other instrument to which Holdings is a party or by which Holdings or any of
the property of Holdings is bound; (d) to the best of our knowledge, results in
the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets of Holdings
(except for the Liens created by the Transaction Documents, Permitted Liens and
Identified Liens); or (e) requires the consent or approval of, or, except for
(A) the filings referred to in paragraph 27 hereof and (B) the filing of the
Aircraft Mortgage and Security Agreement in the aircraft registry maintained by
the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, any filing or
registration with, any Governmental Authority of the United States or of the
State of New York.

       25.  To the best of our knowledge, (i) neither of Holdings nor Airways is
in violation of its respective Charter Documents and (ii) Holdings has filed all
material contracts required to be filed with or in connection with the Holdings
SEC Documents.

       26.  Upon delivery pursuant to the Indenture to the Collateral Trustee of
certificates representing the Pledged Shares (as defined in the Issuer Pledge
and Security Agreement), together with undated stock powers duly endorsed in
blank, and assuming that the Collateral Trustee at all times holds the Pledged
Shares and that the Collateral Trustee takes possession of the Pledged Shares in
good faith and without notice of any adverse claim (as such term is used in
Section 8-302 of the UCC in effect in the State of New York), the Issuer Pledge
and Security Agreement creates a valid and perfected security interest in the
Pledged Shares in favor of the Collateral Trustee, on behalf of and for the
benefit of the holders of Holdings Series A Notes, the Holdings Series B Notes
and the Series A Notes, subject to no other equal or prior consensual
<PAGE>

[X]To the Persons
Listed on Schedule A Hereto
April 12, 2001
Page 9


    security interest which can be perfected under the UCC in favor of any other
    person except as set forth in the Collateral Trust Agreement.

       27.  The provisions of the Issuer Pledge and Security Agreement are
sufficient to grant to the Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Holders of
Secured Debt (as defined in the Collateral Trust Agreement) a security interest
in all right, title and interest of Airways in the Collateral. Assuming that the
"Financing Statements" have been filed in the "Filing Offices" and have not
subsequently been released, terminated or modified, the Collateral Trustee's
security interest in the Collateral has been perfected to the extent such
security interest may be perfected under the (New York) Uniform Commercial Code
by the filing of the Financing Statements.

       28.  The Mortgage is in proper form to create a valid lien under Florida
law in favor of the Collateral Trustee upon the interest of Airways in the real
property described therein. The recordation of the Mortgage in the "Official
Records" of the county where the premises described therein are located is the
only recordation of filing necessary to give constructive notice of such lien to
subsequent purchasers and mortgages of the real property described therein.

       29.  Assuming the accuracy of the representations of Holdings and Airways
in the Transaction Documents as to the use of the proceeds of the transactions
contemplated thereby, neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement, the Holdings Note Agreement nor the sale, issuance,
execution or delivery of the Series A Notes, Holdings Series A Notes or Holdings
Series B Notes will violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System.

       30.  To the best of our knowledge, neither Holdings nor Airways is an
"investment company" registered or required to be registered as an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

       31.  To the best of our knowledge, neither Holdings nor Airways is a
"holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" or an
"affiliate" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

       32.  The Indenture complies as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the TIA and the rules and regulations of the Commission
applicable to an indenture which is qualified thereunder. It is not necessary in
connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the Series A Notes to the
Initial Purchasers in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement or in
connection with the Exempt Resales to qualify the Indenture under the TIA.

            Although we are not passing upon and do not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Holdings 10-K or the
<PAGE>

[X]To the Persons

April 12, 2001
Page 10


exhibits thereto and, taking into account in determining materiality, the
opinions of officers and other representatives of Holdings, in the course of our
participation in the preparation by Holdings of the Holdings 10-K prior to the
date hereof, no facts have come to our attention which would cause us to believe
that the Holdings 10-K as of the date thereof, contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (provided that we express no opinion or belief regarding
the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and
statistical data contained in the Holdings 10-K).

          The opinions expressed above are subject to the following additional
assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions: (a) with respect to the
good standing or due qualification of Holdings and Airways to transact business
as a foreign corporation in any state, the opinions herein are given exclusively
in reliance upon certificates and other written statements of public officials
from such states to such effect; (b) no opinion is expressed herein with respect
to the enforceability of any provision of the Transaction Documents providing
for (i) indemnification for or contribution with respect to securities laws
liabilities to the extent that the enforceability of such provisions may be
limited by applicable federal and state securities laws and general principles
of public policy; (ii) any waiver of the right to jury trial or service with
process by service upon a designated third party or (iii) any waiver of any
other constitutional or statutory right; (c) no opinion is expressed herein as
to the right, title or interest of any party in or to any of the Collateral or,
except as expressly provided in paragraphs 26 and 27 above, as to the perfection
or priority of any security interest or lien on the Collateral; (d) in
connection with the provisions of the Transaction Documents whereby Holdings or
Airways submits to the jurisdiction of (i) the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C. (S)(S)
1331 and 1332 on Federal court jurisdiction, and we also note that such
submissions cannot supersede such court's discretion in determining whether to
transfer an action from one Federal court to another under 28 U.S.C. (S) 1404(a)
and (ii) the New York courts in New York County, we note that such submission
cannot supersede that court's discretion in determining whether to transfer the
place of trial under NYCPLR (S) 510; (e) no opinion is expressed herein as to
any law relating to permissible rates of interest or the computation or
disclosure of interest or any fraudulent transfer laws; (f) such opinions are
subject to the possible unenforceability of provisions requiring indemnification
for, or providing exculpation, release or exemption from liability for action or
inaction, to the extent such action or inaction involves gross negligence or
willful misconduct or to the extent contrary to public policy; (g) such opinions
are subject to the possible unenforceability of waivers or advance consents that
have the effect of waiving statutes of limitations, marshaling of assets or
similar requirements and to the effect of course of dealing, course of
performance, or the like that would modify the terms of an agreement or the
respective rights or obligations under an agreement; (h) such opinions are
subject to the possible unenforceability of provisions that enumerated remedies
are not exclusive
<PAGE>

[X]To the Persons
Listed on Schedule A Hereto
April 12, 2001
Page 11


or that a party has the right to pursue multiple remedies without regard to
other remedies elected or that all remedies are cumulative; (i) such opinions
are subject to the effect of laws requiring mitigation of damages, the possible
unenforceability of provisions that the provisions of an agreement are severable
or that modifications thereto may be made only in writing and the possible
unenforceability of provisions permitting the exercise, under certain
circumstances, of rights without notice or without providing opportunity to cure
failures to perform; (j) the provisions of the Transaction Documents that permit
any other party to take actions or to make determinations may be subject to
requirements that such actions or determinations be reasonable and taken or made
in good faith; (k) the qualification of such opinions for Enforceability
Exceptions also includes the following concepts: (A) principles governing the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other traditional
equitable remedies, (B) principles affording traditional equitable defenses, (C)
impracticability or impossibility of performance, (D) the effect of obstruction,
failure to perform or otherwise act in accordance with an agreement by any
person other than Holding or Airways and (E) unconscionability; (l) we have
assumed that the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby
are not within the prohibitions of Section 405 of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974; and (m) with respect to Holdings' or Airways' rights in or
title to any Collateral, we express no opinion.

          Whenever the opinions expressed above are qualified by the phrase "to
the best of our knowledge," the phrase "known to us" or a phrase of similar
import, it indicates that, during the course of our representation of the
Holdings and Airways, and each of them, in connection with the subject
transaction, no facts have come to the attention of lawyers who have directly
worked on the subject transaction that would cause us to believe that such
opinions are incorrect. The quoted phrases or any phrase of similar import does
not include any information not within the current awareness of lawyers who have
directly worked on the subject transaction that might be revealed if a canvas of
other lawyers in our firm were made, if our firm's files were diligently
searched or if any other investigation were made.

          Our opinions expressed in this letter are limited to the federal laws
of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York, the DGCL,
the NRS and, as to the opinion in paragraph 28 hereof, the laws of the State of
Florida. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to the laws and the rules,
regulations and orders under such laws as currently in effect. Although we are
not admitted to practice law in the States of New York, Delaware or Nevada, as
to the laws of the State of New York and the DGCL and NRS, we have made such
examination of such laws as we have deemed necessary to form the basis of this
opinion. We have also relied, with your permission, upon the opinion addressed
to you of even date herewith of Richard P. Magurno, Senior Vice President and
General Counsel of Holdings, Airways and 717 Leasing with respect to matters
contained therein to the extent relevant to our opinions herein.

times.

power (in the name of the Company or otherwise) to ask for, require, demand,
receive, compound, and give acquittance for any and all money and claims for
money (in each case including Rent and insurance and requisition proceeds) due
and to become due under or arising out of the Mortgagee Agreements, and all
other property which now or hereafter constitutes part of the Collateral, to
endorse any checks or other instruments or orders in connection therewith, and
to file any claims or to take any action or to institute any proceedings that
Mortgagee deems necessary or advisable in connection with this Mortgage;
provided, that Mortgagee shall not exercise any such rights except during the
existence of an Event of Default.

     Upon Mortgagee's written request, the Company will promptly and duly
execute and deliver (or cause to be duly executed and delivered) any and all
such further instruments and documents (including UCC continuation statements)
as Mortgagee reasonably deems necessary to perfect, preserve, or protect the
mortgage, security interests, and assignments created or intended to be created
hereby, or to obtain for Mortgagee the full benefits of the assignment

                                                                          PAGE 6

hereunder and of the rights and powers herein granted.

     Any and all property described or referred to in the granting clauses
hereof which the Company acquires in the future shall ipso facto, and without
any other conveyance, assignment, or act on the part of the Company or

completely as though specifically described herein, but nothing in this

paragraphs.

     Airframe to normal interchange agreements, or (bb) any Engine to normal
     interchange agreements or pooling agreements or arrangements, in each case
     customary in the commercial airline industry and entered into by the
     Company or such Permitted Lessee in the ordinary course of business;
     provided, that no such agreement or arrangement requires the transfer of
     title

                                                                          PAGE 7
<PAGE>

     to any such Engine and if the Company's title to any such Engine is

     such divestiture, and the Company shall comply with (S) 4.04(e) in respect
     thereof;

               (2)  deliver or permit any Permitted Lessee to deliver possession

     or Part, or, to the extent required or permitted by (S) 4.04, for
     alterations or modifications in or additions to such Aircraft, Airframe, or
     Engine, or (bb) to any Person for the purpose of transport to a Person
     referred to in the preceding clause (aa);

               (3)  install or permit any Permitted Lessee to install an Engine
     on an airframe owned by the Company or such Permitted Lessee free and clear

     or pooling agreements and arrangements of the type permitted under (S)
     4.02(b)(1);

               (4)  install or permit any Permitted Lessee to install an Engine
     on an airframe leased to the Company or such Permitted Lessee, or purchased
     or owned by the Company or such Permitted Lessee, subject to a security
     agreement, conditional sale, or other secured financing arrangement, but

     rights of the parties to such lease, or any such secured financing
     arrangement, covering such airframe, and (ii) Liens of the type permitted
     by clause (3) of this (S) 4.02(b), and (bb) the Company or Permitted Lessee

     such transfer of possession (and, in the case of any transfer pursuant to

     numbers the Contracting Office Representative or Representatives for the
     Air Mobility Command of the United States Air Force to whom notices must be

               (7)  enter into a Wet Lease with respect to any Aircraft or
     Airframe or any other aircraft on which an Engine may be installed (which
     shall not be considered a transfer of possession hereunder); provided, that
     the Company's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect
     notwithstanding any Wet Lease;

               (8)  if no Significant Default or Event or Default exists, and
     subject to the paragraph immediately following clause (9) below, enter into
     a lease with respect to any Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine to any Permitted
     Air Carrier or Permitted Manufacturer who is not then subject to any
     bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, or
     similar proceeding and shall not have substantially all of its property in
     the possession of any liquidator, trustee, receiver, or similar Person; but
     only if, in the case only of a lease to a Permitted Foreign Air Carrier or
     non-U.S. Permitted Manufacturer, the Company furnishes Mortgagee a
     favorable opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
     Mortgagee, of independent counsel, selected by the Company and reasonably
     satisfactory to Mortgagee, located in the country of domicile of such
     Permitted Foreign Air Carrier or non-U.S. Permitted Manufacturer, that (aa)
     the terms of such lease are the legal, valid, and binding obligations of
     the parties thereto, enforceable under the laws of such jurisdiction, (bb)
     it is not necessary for Mortgagee to register or qualify to do business in
     such jurisdiction, if not already so registered or qualified, as a result
     of the proposed lease, (cc) the validity, priority, and perfection of
     Mortgagee's Lien in respect of such Aircraft, Airframe, and Engines will be
     recognized and enforceable in such jurisdiction, (dd) the Laws of such
     jurisdiction of domicile require fair compensation by the government of
     such jurisdiction, payable in a currency freely convertible into Dollars,
     for the loss of title to such Aircraft, Airframe, or Engines in the event
     of the requisition by such government of such title (unless the Company
     provides insurance in the amounts required with respect to hull insurance
     under this Mortgage covering the requisition of title to such Aircraft,
     Airframe, or Engines by the government of such jurisdiction so long as such
     Aircraft, Airframe, or Engines are subject to such lease), (ee) such
     Permitted Air Carrier's or Permitted Manufacturer's agreement that its
     rights under the lease are subject and subordinate to all the terms of this
     Mortgage is enforceable against such Permitted Air Carrier or Permitted
     Manufacturer under applicable law, (ff) there is no strict tort liability
     imposed on passive lenders or lessors, except such tort liability not of
     materially greater scope or magnitude than might be imposed on such passive
     lender or lessor under the prevailing rule among the states of the United
     States, and except liabilities that the Company or a Permitted Lessee has
     agreed to insure against at its expense in a manner and to the extent
     customarily insured by major international air carriers operating in such
     jurisdiction, and (gg) Mortgagee and the Holders shall not be subjected to
     any adverse Tax consequences as a result of such lease for which the
     Company is not required to indemnify such Person, unless the Company agrees
     to indemnify such Person therefor by means of an indemnity agreement and
     security therefor reasonably satisfactory to such Person;

          (9)  If no Significant Default or Event of Default exists, enter into
     a lease or sublease with respect to any Aircraft, Airframe or Engine which
     does not comply with

     any of clauses (1) through (8) of this (S) 4.02(b) and, in such event,
     delivery of any such Aircraft, Airframe or Engine under such lease or
     sublease shall be deemed to constitute an Event of Loss with respect to
     such Aircraft, Airframe or Engine and the Company shall comply with (S)
     4.05(a), in the case of an Aircraft or Airframe, or (S) 4.04(e), in the
     case of an Engine, in each case prior to or concurrently with the
     commencement of such lease or sublease.

provided, that (1) the rights of any transferee who receives possession by
reason of a transfer permitted by this (S) 4.02(b) (other than by a transfer of
an Aircraft, Airframe or Engine which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be
subject and subordinate to this Mortgage and to Mortgagee's rights, powers and
remedies hereunder, including (x) Mortgagee's right to repossess such Aircraft
pursuant to (S) 5.02, (y) Mortgagee's right to terminate and avoid such lease,
delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession if an Event of Default
exists, and (z) the right to require such Person to deliver the applicable
Aircraft, Airframe, and Engines subject to such transfer forthwith if an Event
of Default exists, (2) the Company shall remain primarily liable for the
performance this Mortgage and all the terms and conditions of this Mortgage
shall remain in effect, and (3) no lease or transfer of possession otherwise in
compliance with this (S) 4.02(b) shall (aa) result in any registration or
reregistration of an Aircraft (except to the extent permitted by (S) 4.02(e)) or
the maintenance, operation, or use thereof except in compliance with (S) 4.02(c)
and (S) 4.02(d), or (bb) permit any action not permitted to the Company
hereunder.

     In the case of any lease permitted under this (S) 4.02(b) (other than a
lease of an Aircraft, Airframe or Engine that is deemed an Event of Loss), the
Company will include in such lease appropriate provisions which (x) make such
lease expressly subject and subordinate to this Mortgage, including Mortgagee's
right to avoid such lease in the exercise of its rights to repossession of the
applicable Airframe and Engines hereunder; (y) require the Permitted Lessee to
comply with (S) 4.06, to the extent that the Company does not obligate itself
therein to do so; and (z) require that the Airframe or any Engine subject
thereto be used in accordance with the limitations applicable to the Company's
possession and use provided in this Mortgage and provide for the maintenance and
inspection of the Aircraft in the same manner in all material respects as the
applicable provisions of this Mortgage. No lease permitted under this (S)
4.02(b) shall be entered into unless (i) the Company provides written notice to
Mortgagee (such notice in the event of a lease to a U.S. Air Carrier to be given
promptly after entering into any such lease, and, in the case of a lease to any
other Permitted Air Carrier or a Permitted Manufacturer, 10 days in advance of
entering into such lease); (ii) the Company furnishes to Mortgagee evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee that the insurance required by (S) 4.06 is
in effect; (iii) all necessary documents are duly filed, registered, or recorded
in such public offices as may be required fully to preserve the first-priority
security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) of Mortgagee in such Aircraft
under this Mortgage; (iv) no Permitted Lessee may sublease any Airframe or any
Engine, except that a Permitted Manufacturer may sublease to any Permitted
Lessee to whom a lease would be permitted under this (S) 4.02; provided that (A)
such sublease shall not permit any sub-subleasing of such Aircraft, such
Airframe, or any Engine (and the Company shall ensure that the same does not
occur), (B) such sublease shall be assigned to the Company to secure such
Permitted Manufacturer's obligations under its lease, and (C) the Company shall
comply, and shall cause such sublease to comply, with all requirements of this
(S) 4.02 as if such sublease were a direct lease from the Company to the
sublessee; (v) the


                                                                         PAGE 10
<PAGE>

Permitted Lessee shall not be eligible to assert, or shall have effectively
waived, any right to sovereign immunity; and (vi) Mortgagee receives evidence
that all necessary approvals from any Government Entity required for such
Airframe or any Engine or engine (as applicable) to be imported to and, to the
extent reasonably obtainable and reasonably requested, exported from the
applicable country of domicile upon repossession of such equipment by Mortgagee
shall have been obtained prior to the importation of the imported item(s) under
any such Permitted Lease. The Company shall reimburse Mortgagee for its
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and Expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with any such lease. Except as
otherwise provided herein and without in any way relieving the Company from its
primary obligation for the performance of its obligations under this Mortgage,
the Company may in its sole discretion permit a lessee to exercise any or all
rights which the Company would be entitled to exercise under (S) 4.02 and (S)
4.04, and may cause a lessee to perform any or all of the Company's obligations
under Article IV, and Mortgagee agrees to accept actual and full performance
thereof by a lessee in lieu of performance by the Company.

     In addition to the foregoing requirements, before the commencement of any
Permitted Lease, the Company shall deliver to Mortgagee: (i) a notice stating
the identity of the lessee, (ii) a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the
Company stating that no Significant Default or Event or Default exists and that
such lease complies with this (S) 4.02, (iii) the consent of the Permitted
Lessee to the assignment of its Permitted Lease pursuant to the final paragraph
of this (S) 4.02(b), in a form reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee, (iv) if
required by the final paragraph of this (S) 4.02(b), the Lease Assignment
referred to therein, and a supplement to the Mortgage and Financing Statements
or similar documents under the applicable Laws of the country of the Permitted
Lessee confirming the perfected first-priority security interest of Mortgagee in
such Permitted Lease, duly executed and delivered and duly filed or recorded in
all appropriate places, and (v) the original chattel paper copy of the Permitted
Lease, and any lease supplements executed therewith, duly executed by the
applicable Permitted Lessee and the Company. In addition, the Company shall also
deliver to Mortgagee: (i) within 20 Business Days after the commencement of such
Permitted Lease, a copy of all Permitted Lease Documents, duly certified by a
Responsible Officer of each of the Company and the applicable Permitted Lessee
to be true, complete and correct copies of the originals thereof, and (ii)
within 10 Business Days after the execution thereof by both parties, the
original chattel paper copy of any amendments to the Permitted Lease (or any
other Permitted Lease Document) that may be entered into from time to time after
the commencement of such Permitted Lease, duly executed by such Permitted Lessee
and the Company. No relinquishment of possession of any Airframe, Engine, or
Part shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the Company's obligations.

     Mortgagee hereby agrees for the benefit of each lessor, conditional seller,
or secured party of any engine leased, purchased, or owned by the Company or any
Permitted Lessee subject to a lease, conditional sale, or other security
agreement that Mortgagee, each Holder, and their respective successors and
assigns will not acquire or claim, as against such lessor, conditional seller,
or secured party, any right, title, or interest in any engine as the result of
the installation of such engine on an Airframe at any time while such engine is
subject to such lease, conditional sale, or other security agreement and owned
by such lessor or conditional seller or subject to a security interest in favor
of such secured party.


                                                                         PAGE 11
<PAGE>

     The Company shall enter into a "Lease Assignment" in form and substance
customary in the airline industry with respect to each Permitted Lease of an
Airframe having a term of one or more years. In furtherance of the provisions of
this paragraph, the Company agrees that each Permitted Lease for more than one
year of an Airframe (x) shall contain a provision to the effect that the
Permitted Lessee agrees to pay all amounts due under the Permitted Lease,
including Rent (exclusive of Excluded Payments), to Mortgagee after the
Permitted Lessee receives written notice from Mortgagee to such effect (until
the Permitted Lessee receives written notice from Mortgagee to contrary effect)
and stating that a Default or Event or Default exists under this Mortgage, and
(y) shall be accompanied by such Financing Statements, if any, as shall, in
Mortgagee's reasonable opinion, be required to perfect and protect the security
interests of Mortgagee in the Company's right, title and interest in and to such
Permitted Lease.

          (c)  Operation and Use. The Company shall not operate, use, or locate
               -----------------
any Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine, or allow any Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine to
be operated, used, or located, (1) in any area excluded from coverage by any
insurance required by (S) 4.06, except in the case of a requisition by the U.S.
Government where the Company obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from
the U.S. Government, or insurance from the U.S. Government, against
substantially the same risks and for at least the amounts of the insurance
required by (S) 4.06 covering such area, or (2) in any recognized area of
hostilities unless covered in accordance with (S) 4.06 by war risk insurance, or
in either case unless such Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine is only temporarily
operated, used, or located in such area as a result of an emergency, equipment
malfunction, navigational error, hijacking, weather condition, or other similar
unforeseen circumstance, so long as the Company diligently and in good faith
proceeds to remove such Aircraft from such area. The Company shall not permit
any Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine to be used, operated, maintained, serviced,
repaired or overhauled (x) in violation of any Law binding on or applicable to
such Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine or (y) in violation of any airworthiness
certificate, license, or registration of any Government Entity relating to such
Aircraft, such Airframe, or any Engine, except (i) immaterial or non-recurring
violations with respect to which corrective measures are taken promptly by the
Company or Permitted Lessee upon discovery thereof, or (ii) to the extent the
validity or application of any such Law or requirement relating to any such
certificate, license, or registration is being contested in good faith by the
Company or Permitted Lessee in any reasonable manner which does not involve any
material risk of the sale, forfeiture, or loss of any Aircraft, Airframe, or
Engine, any material risk of criminal liability or material civil penalty
against Mortgagee or any Holder or impair Mortgagee's or any Holder's interest
in such Aircraft, Airframe, or Engine.

          (d)  Maintenance and Repair. At its own cost and expense, the Company
               ----------------------
shall cause each Aircraft, Airframe, and Engine to be maintained, serviced,
repaired, and overhauled in accordance with (1) maintenance standards required
by, or substantially as stringent as those required by, either the FAA or the
central aviation authority of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New
Zealand or the United Kingdom for each Aircraft, Airframe, and Engine (the
"Maintenance Program"), so as (aa) to keep each Aircraft, Airframe, and Engine
in as good operating condition as on the Issuance Date, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and (bb) to keep each Aircraft in such operating condition as may be
necessary to enable the applicable airworthiness certification of such Aircraft
to be maintained under the regulations of the FAA or


                                                                         PAGE 12
<PAGE>

other Aviation Authority then having jurisdiction over the operation of such
Aircraft (but in any event in accordance with the Maintenance Program), except
during (x) temporary periods of storage in accordance with applicable
regulations, (y) maintenance and modification permitted hereunder, or (z)
periods when the FAA or such other Aviation Authority has revoked or suspended
the airworthiness certificates for Similar Aircraft; and (2) except during
periods when a Permitted Lease is in effect, the same standards as the Company
uses with respect to similar aircraft of similar size in its fleet operated by
the Company in similar circumstances and, during any period in which a Permitted
Lease is in effect, the same standards used by the Permitted Lessee with respect
to similar aircraft of similar size in its fleet and operated by the Permitted
Lessee in similar circumstances. The Company further agrees that each Aircraft,
Airframe, and Engine will be maintained, used, serviced, repaired, overhauled,
or inspected in compliance with applicable Laws with respect to the maintenance
of each such Aircraft and in compliance with each applicable airworthiness
certificate, license, and registration relating to each such Aircraft, Airframe,
or Engine issued by the Aviation Authority, other than minor or nonrecurring
violations with respect to which corrective measures are taken upon discovery
thereof and except to the extent the Company or Permitted Lessee is contesting
in good faith the validity or application of any such Law or requirement
relating to any such certificate, license, or registration in any reasonable
manner which does not create a material risk of sale, loss, or forfeiture of
such Aircraft, Airframe, or Engines or the interest of Mortgagee or any Holder
therein, or any risk of criminal liability or material civil penalty against
Mortgagee or any Holder; provided, that no contest shall excuse the failure to
maintain the airworthiness certification for the Aircraft in good standing
without Mortgagee's written consent (except while any such Aircraft is
grounded), nor shall the pendency of any contest prevent a prohibition of use
from becoming an Event of Loss. The Company shall maintain or cause to be
maintained the Aircraft Documents in English (except that, during the term of
any Permitted Lease to a Permitted Lessee that is not a U.S. Air Carrier, such
Permitted Lessee may maintain Aircraft Documents in the primary language of the
country in which such Permitted Lessee is located, and such Aircraft Documents
shall be translated into English on an ongoing basis and no less frequently than
once each year).

          (e)  Registration. So long as any Secured Debt is outstanding, the
               ------------
Company shall cause each Aircraft to be and to remain duly registered in its
name under the Transportation Code, except as otherwise permitted by this (S)
4.02(e). Each Holder and Mortgagee hereby agree, for the Company's benefit that,
subject to (S) 4.02(b) of this Mortgage, the Company shall be entitled to
register an Aircraft, or cause an Aircraft to be registered, in a country other
than the United States, if Mortgagee receives at least 30 days' prior written
notice of such proposed reregistration, and if:

               (1) no Significant Default or Event or Default exists at the time
     of such reregistration;

               (2) such reregistration is made in connection with a Permitted
     Lease to a Permitted Lessee and shall be effected in the name of the
     Company if reasonably possible or, if required by applicable Law, in the
     name of such Permitted Lessee;

               (3) such country is a country with which the United States then
     maintains


                                                                         PAGE 13
<PAGE>

     normal diplomatic relations or, if Taiwan, the United States then
     maintains diplomatic relations at least as good as those in effect on the
     Issuance Date;

               (4)  any exchange permits necessary to allow all Rent and other
     payments provided for under the Permitted Lease Documents shall be in full
     force and effect, and any import or export permits necessary to take such
     Aircraft into such country and shall be in full force and effect or
     obtained as promptly as practicable;

               (5)  all insurance required to be maintained by the Company under
     the terms of this Mortgage shall be in full force and effect and with
     substantially equivalent coverages before, at the time of, and after such
     reregistration (including any increase in changes in types of insurance to
     take into account differences in applicable Laws), and Mortgagee receives a
     certificate of the Company's or a Permitted Lessee's insurance broker to
     such effect;

               (6)  Mortgagee receives evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
     that such country imposes, or the Company agrees to cause such Aircraft to
     be maintained in accordance with, a Maintenance Program as required by (S)
     4.02(d) of this Mortgage;

               (7)  no Liens (except Permitted Liens) on the Collateral shall
     arise by reason of such reregistration, and this Mortgage shall continue as
     a first-priority perfected Lien on such Aircraft;

               (8)  any export licenses and certificates of deregistration
     required in connection with any repossession or return of such Aircraft
     should be able to be obtained in the normal course, without material delay,
     and without material burden (however, the Company shall be responsible for
     the cost of such export licenses and certificates);

               (9)  such Aircraft has been duly certificated as to type and
     airworthiness by the appropriate aviation authority of such country;

               (10) Mortgagee receives an opinion of independent counsel or
     counsels (subject to customary exceptions) reasonably satisfactory to
     Mortgagee, addressed to Mortgagee, to the effect that:

               (A)  such country recognizes the Company's ownership interest in
          such Aircraft;

               (B)  Mortgagee's rights and interests under this Mortgage will be
          recognized, and there will be available remedies, in each case, by
          enforcement of the provisions of this Mortgage or otherwise under the
          laws of such jurisdiction (or the laws of the jurisdiction to which
          the laws of such jurisdiction would refer as the applicable governing
          law) sufficient to realize the practical benefits of the security
          interest granted hereunder to the Mortgagee by the Company in such
          Aircraft;

               (C)  after giving effect to such change in registration, the Lien
          of this Mortgage


                                                                         PAGE 14
<PAGE>

          on the Company's right, title, and interest in and to such Aircraft
          shall continue as a valid and duly perfected first-priority security
          interest and all filing, or other action necessary to protect the same
          shall have been accomplished (or, if such opinion cannot be given at
          the time of such proposed change in registration because such change
          in registration is not yet effective, (1) the opinion shall detail
          what filing, recording, or other action is necessary, and (2)
          Mortgagee shall receive a certificate from the Company that all
          necessary preparations to accomplish such filing, recording, and other
          action have been made, and such filing, recording, and other action
          will be accomplished, and a supplemental opinion to that effect shall
          be delivered to Mortgagee promptly after the effective date of such
          change in registration);

               (D) it is not necessary, solely as a consequence of such change
          in registration and without giving effect to any other activity of
          Mortgagee (or any Affiliate of Mortgagee), for Mortgagee to qualify to
          do business in such jurisdiction as a result of such reregistration in
          order to exercise any rights or remedies with respect to such Aircraft
          pursuant to this Mortgage;

               (E) neither Mortgagee nor any Holder will be subjected to any
          adverse Tax consequences as a result of such reregistration for which
          the Company is not required to indemnify such Person, unless the
          Company agrees to indemnify such Person therefor by means of an
          indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to such Person (and
          Holdings guarantees such indemnity); and

               (F) to the effect set forth in clauses (4), (7) and (8), subject
          to then-customary assumptions, exceptions, and limitations, and
          stating that such country maintains normal diplomatic relations with
          the United States.

          In addition, as a condition to any change in registration of an
     Aircraft or Airframe the Company shall have given to Mortgagee assurances
     reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee:

               (1) that the provisions of (S) 4.06 of this Mortgage have been
     complied with respect to such Aircraft or Airframe after giving effect to
     such reregistration;

               (2) of the Company's payment of reasonable out-of-pocket Expenses
     of Mortgagee in connection with such change of registry, including (aa) the
     reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to Mortgagee, (bb) any filing
     or recording fees, Taxes, or similar payments incurred in connection with
     the change of registration of such Aircraft and the creation and perfection
     of the security interest therein in favor of Mortgagee for the benefit of
     Holders, and (cc) all costs and Expenses incurred in connection with any
     filings necessary to continue in the United States the perfection of the
     security interest in such Aircraft in favor of Mortgagee for the benefit of
     Holders; and

               (3) to the effect that the tax and other indemnities in favor of
     each Person named as an indemnitee hereunder afford each such Person
     substantially the same


                                                                         PAGE 15
<PAGE>

     protection as provided before such change of registration (or the Company
     agrees to provide additional indemnities that, together with such original
     indemnities, in the reasonable judgment of Mortgagee, afford such
     protection).

The Company shall also cause this Mortgage to be duly recorded and at all times
maintained of record as a first-priority perfected mortgage (subject to
Permitted Liens) on such Aircraft, Airframe, and the Engines (except to the
extent such perfection or priority cannot be maintained as a result of the
failure by Mortgagee to execute and deliver any necessary documents).

             (f)  Markings. If permitted by applicable Law, on or reasonably
                  --------
promptly after the Issuance Date, the Company will cause to be affixed to, and
maintained in, the cockpit of each Airframe and on each Engine, in each case, in
a clearly visible location, a placard of a reasonable size and shape bearing the
legend: "Subject to a security interest in favor of Wilmington Trust Company, as
Mortgagee." Such placards may be removed temporarily, if necessary, in the
course of maintenance of any Airframe or Engine. If any such placard is damaged
or becomes illegible, the Company shall promptly replace it with a placard
complying with the requirements of this (S) 4.02(f).

             (g)  Spare Parts.  The Company represents and warrants that (1)
                  -----------
substantially all its Spare Parts are located at one of the locations identified
in Schedule 3 hereto (except those Spare Parts installed on an Aircraft or being
repaired, maintained or inspected in accordance with the provisions hereof); (2)
the Company has good, indefeasible and merchantable title to such Spare Parts
and such Spare Parts are not subject to any Lien except for the Lien granted to
Mortgagee and Permitted Liens, and (3) the repossession, sale or other
disposition of such Spare Parts by Mortgagee following an Event of Default shall
not require the consent of any Person.  The Company further covenants that no
substantial portion of the Spare Parts shall at any time be stored at any
location other than a location identified on Schedule 3 without 15 days' prior
written notice to Mortgagee setting forth the new location.

     4.3 Inspection

         (a)   At all reasonable times, Mortgagee, a single representative of
the Holders and their authorized representatives (the "Inspecting Parties") may
not more than once every 12 months (unless an Event of Default exists, then at
any time and from time to time) inspect each Aircraft and the Aircraft
Documents, and any such Inspecting Party may make copies of such Aircraft
Documents not reasonably deemed confidential by the Company or a Permitted
Lessee.

         (b)   Any inspection of an Aircraft hereunder shall be limited to a
visual, walk-around inspection, and shall not include the opening of any panels,
bays, or other components of such Aircraft, and no such inspection shall
interfere with the Company's or any Permitted Lessee's maintenance or operation
of such Aircraft, Airframe, or Engines.

         (c)   With respect to such rights of inspection, Mortgagee shall not
have any duty or liability to make, or any duty or liability by reason of not
making, any such visit, inspection or survey.


                                                                         PAGE 16
<PAGE>

          (d)  Each Inspecting Party shall bear its own expenses in connection
with any such inspection (including the cost of any copies made in accordance
with (S) 4.03(a)), unless an Event of Default exists, then any such inspection
(including the cost of such copies) shall be at the Company's expense.

     4.04 Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations, Modifications, and
Additions; Substitution of Engines

          (a)  Replacement of Parts.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the
               --------------------
Company, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace (or cause to be
replaced) all Parts that are from time to time incorporated or installed in or
attached to an Aircraft, and that become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed,
seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair, or permanently rendered unfit for
use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, the Company, at its own cost and
expense, may remove (or cause to be removed) in the ordinary course of
maintenance, service, repair, overhaul, or testing any Parts, whether or not
worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair,
or permanently rendered unfit for use; provided, that, except as otherwise
provided herein, the Company will replace or cause the replacement of such Parts
as promptly as practicable. All replacement parts shall be free and clear of all
Liens, except for Permitted Liens and pooling arrangements to the extent
permitted by (S) 4.04(c), and shall be in good operating condition. The Company
shall use good faith efforts to ensure that (except in the case of replacement
property installed on the basis of operational exigencies) all replacement parts
have a value, remaining useful life, and utility that is not substantially less
than the value, remaining useful life, and utility of the Parts replaced
(assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition required hereunder).

          (b)  Parts.  Subject to (S) 11.01 and except as otherwise provided
               -----
herein, any Part at any time removed from any Airframe or Engine shall remain
subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, no matter where located, until it is
replaced by a Part that has been incorporated or installed in or attached to
such Airframe or any Engine and that meets the requirements for replacement
Parts specified above. As soon as a replacement Part is incorporated or
installed in or attached to any Airframe or any Engine as provided in (S)
4.04(a), without further act, (1) the replaced Part shall thereupon be free and
clear of all rights of Mortgagee and shall no longer be a Part hereunder, and
(2) such replacement Part shall become subject to this Mortgage and be part of
such Airframe or Engine for all purposes hereof to the same extent as the Parts
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to such Airframe or Engine;
provided, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all Spare Parts are
and shall remain subject to the Lien of this Mortgage until such time as the
Lien over such Spare Parts is released in accordance with the terms of (S)
11.01.

          (c)  Pooling of Parts.  Any Part removed from an Aircraft may be
               ----------------
subjected by the Company or a Permitted Lessee to a normal pooling arrangement
customary in the airline industry and entered into in the ordinary course of
business of the Company or Permitted Lessee, provided, that the part replacing
such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to such
Airframe or any Engine in accordance with (S) 4.04(a) and (S) 4.04(b) as
promptly as practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In addition, any
replacement part when incorporated or installed in or attached to any Airframe
or Engine may be owned by any third

                                                                         PAGE 17
<PAGE>

party, subject to a normal pooling arrangement, so long as the Company or a
Permitted Lessee, as promptly thereafter as reasonably possible, either (1)
causes such replacement part to become subject to the Lien of this Mortgage,
free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, at which time such
replacement part shall become a Part, or (2) replaces (or causes to be replaced)
such replacement part by incorporating or installing in or attaching to such
Aircraft a further replacement Part owned by the Company free and clear of all
Liens except Permitted Liens and which shall become subject to the Lien of this
Mortgage in accordance with (S) 4.04(b).

          (d)  Alterations, Modifications, and Additions. The Company shall make
               -----------------------------------------
(or cause to be made) alterations and modifications in and additions to each
Aircraft as may be required to be made from time to time to meet the applicable
standards of the FAA or other Aviation Authority having jurisdiction over any
such operation of such Aircraft, to the extent made mandatory in respect of such
Aircraft (a "Mandatory Modification"); provided, that (i) the Company or a
Permitted Lessee may, in good faith and by appropriate procedures, contest the
validity or application of any law, rule, regulation, or order in any reasonable
manner which does not materially adversely affect Mortgagee's interest in such
Aircraft and does not involve a material risk of sale, forfeiture, or loss of
such Aircraft or the interest of Mortgagee or any Holder therein, or a material
risk of material civil penalty or a material risk of criminal liability being
imposed on Mortgagee or any Holder or (ii) the Company need not make any
Mandatory Modification if, acting reasonably and in good faith, it concludes
that making any such modification would be commercially unreasonable taking into
account the value of the Aircraft, Airframe or Engine and the projected cost of
such modification and the Company decides thereafter to part-out, sell, exchange
or otherwise dispose of such Aircraft, Airframe or Engine or otherwise withdraw
such Aircraft, Airframe or Engine from service. In addition, the Company may
make or permit to be made such alterations and modifications in and additions to
an Airframe or any Engine (each an "Optional Modification") as the Company or a
Permitted Lessee, in its good faith, deems desirable in the proper conduct of
its business or to remarket the Aircraft, including removal of Parts which the
Company deems are obsolete or no longer suitable or appropriate for use in such
Aircraft or conversion of any Aircraft to a cargo configuration; provided, that
no such Optional Modification shall (1) in any material respect diminish the
fair market value, utility, or useful life of any Aircraft or Engine below its
fair market value, utility, or useful life immediately before such Optional
Modification (assuming such Aircraft or Engine was in the condition required by
this Mortgage immediately before such Optional Modification), or (2) cause any
Aircraft to cease to have a standard certificate of airworthiness. Except as
otherwise provided herein, all Parts (other than Removable Parts) incorporated
or installed in or attached to an Aircraft as a result of such Optional
Modification shall, without further act, become subject to this Mortgage. The
Company or any Permitted Lessee may, at any time so long as an Airframe or any
Engine is subject to the Lien of this Mortgage, remove any such Part (such Part
being referred to herein as a "Removable Part") from such Airframe or an Engine
if (i) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or in substitution
for, any Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached to such
Airframe or any Engine at the time of delivery thereof hereunder or any Part in
replacement of, or in substitution for, any such original Part, (ii) such Part
is not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such
Airframe or any Engine pursuant to (S) 4.02(d) or the first sentence of this (S)
4.04(d), and (iii) such Part can be removed from such Airframe or any Engine
without diminishing in any material respect the fair market value, utility, or
remaining useful life

                                                                         PAGE 18
<PAGE>

which such Airframe or any Engine would have had at the time of removal had such
removal not been effected, assuming such Aircraft was otherwise maintained in
the condition required by this Mortgage and such Removable Part had not been
incorporated or installed in or attached to such Aircraft. No Removable Part
shall be subject to the Lien of this Mortgage; except that any Part not removed
before the repossession by Mortgagee hereunder of the Airframe or Engine on
which it is incorporated, installed, or attached shall at that time, without
further act, become a part of such Airframe or Engine and be subject to the Lien
of this Mortgage. Removable Parts may be leased from or financed by third
parties other than Mortgagee.

          (e)  Substitution of Engines. If an Event of Loss to an Engine occurs
               -----------------------
under circumstances in which no Event of Loss to an Airframe occurs, the Company
shall (i) promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such occurrence)
notify Mortgagee of such Event of Loss and (ii) within 120 days of the
occurrence of such Event of Loss either substitute a Replacement Engine for such
Engine, free and clear of Liens (other than Permitted Liens not of record) or,
provided no Significant Default or Event of Default shall exist, give written
notice to Mortgagee that the Company has elected to treat the Event of Loss as a
Disposition pursuant to (S) 4.05(f). In such event, immediately upon the earlier
of (x) receipt by Mortgagee of such notice or (y) the effectiveness of such
substitution and in either case without further act, (1) the Engine subject to
such Event of Loss shall thereupon be free and clear of all rights of Mortgagee
and the Lien of this Mortgage and shall no longer be an Engine hereunder, and
(2) if replacement is elected by the Company, upon replacement of the Engine
subject to the Event of Loss, such Replacement Engine shall become subject to
this Mortgage and be part of the applicable Aircraft for all purposes hereof to
the same extent as the replaced Engine and all insurance proceeds received by
Mortgagee shall be paid over to or at the direction of the Company. In addition,
Mortgagee shall, at the Company's cost and expense, execute and deliver such
releases or other documents to evidence the release of the Lien of this Mortgage
on the Engine subject to the Event of Loss as the Company may reasonably
request. If replacement is elected by the Company, any Replacement Engine shall
be an engine manufactured by Engine Manufacturer that is the same or improved
model as the Engine to be replaced thereby (but in any event the same or
improved model as the other Engine then installed on such Aircraft), and that is
suitable for installation and use on the applicable Airframe, and that has a
value and utility (without regard to hours and cycles remaining until overhaul)
of not less than 80% of the Engine to be replaced thereby (assuming that such
Engine had been maintained in accordance with this Mortgage). The Company's
right to make a replacement hereunder shall be subject to the fulfillment (which
may be simultaneous with such replacement) of the following conditions precedent
at the Company's sole cost and expense, and Mortgagee agrees to cooperate with
the Company to the extent necessary to enable it timely to satisfy such
conditions:

               (1)  an executed counterpart of each of the following documents
     shall be delivered to Mortgagee:

                    (aa) a supplement to this Mortgage covering the Replacement
          Engine, which shall be duly filed for recordation pursuant to the
          Transportation Code or such other applicable law of the jurisdiction
          other than the United States in which the aircraft of which such
          Engine is a part is registered in accordance with (S) 4.02(e);

                                                                         PAGE 19
<PAGE>

                    (bb) a full warranty (as to title) bill of sale, covering
          the Replacement Engine, executed by the former owner thereof in favor
          of the Company (or, at the Company's option, other evidence of the
          Company's ownership of such Replacement Engine, reasonably
          satisfactory to Mortgagee); and

                    (cc) Financing Statements covering the security interests
          created by this Mortgage (or any similar statements or other documents
          required to be filed or delivered pursuant to the laws of the
          jurisdiction in which such Aircraft may be registered) as are deemed
          necessary or desirable by counsel for Mortgagee to protect the
          security interests of Mortgagee in the Replacement Engine;

               (2)  The Company shall cause to be delivered to Mortgagee an
     opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the Lien of this Mortgage
     continues to be in full force and effect with respect to the Replacement
     Engine, and such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of
     (S) 4.06 with respect to such Replacement Engine as Mortgagee reasonably
     requests; and

               (3)  The Company shall have furnished to Mortgagee an opinion of
     the Company's aviation law counsel reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee and
     addressed to Mortgagee as to the due filing for recordation of the
     supplement to this Mortgage with respect to such Replacement Engine under
     the Transportation Code or such other applicable law of the jurisdiction
     other than the United States in which such Aircraft is registered in
     accordance with (S) 4.02(e) and the due filing of any Financing Statements
     or other filings reasonably requested by Mortgagee with respect to such
     Replacement Engine under applicable Law.

     Upon satisfaction of all conditions to such substitution, (x) Mortgagee
shall execute and deliver to the Company such documents and instruments,
prepared at the Company's expense, as the Company reasonably requests to
evidence the release of such replaced Engine from the Lien of this Mortgage, (y)
Mortgagee shall assign to the Company all claims that Mortgagee may have against
any other Person relating to any Event of Loss giving rise to such substitution,
and (z) the Company shall receive all insurance proceeds (other than those
reserved to others under (S) 4.06(b)) and proceeds in respect of any Event of
Loss giving rise to such replacement to the extent not previously applied to the
purchase price of the Replacement Engine as provided in (S) 4.05(d).

     4.05 Loss, Destruction, or Requisition; Sale of any Aircraft, Airframe,
Engines or Parts

          (a)  Event of Loss to an Aircraft. If an Event of Loss to an Airframe
               ----------------------------
(and any Engine(s) installed thereon) occurs, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 10 days after such occurrence, or, if later, within 10 days
after the determination that an Event of Loss has occurred) notify Mortgagee of
such Event of Loss and within 60 days after notice of such Event of Loss is
required, notify Mortgagee in writing of the Company's election to either (i)
replace such Airframe (and any Engines installed thereon) as provided under (S)
4.05(a)(1), (ii) make payment in respect of such Event of Loss as provided under
(S) 4.05(a)(2) or (iii) treat

                                                                         PAGE 20
<PAGE>

such Event of Loss as a Disposition pursuant to (S) 4.05(f) (and if the Company
does not notify Mortgagee of such election within such time period, the Company
shall be deemed to have elected to treat the Event of Loss as a Disposition
pursuant to (S) 4.05(f)).

               (1)  If the Company elects to replace such Airframe (and any
     Engines installed thereon) (and the Company shall not, without consent of
     the Mortgagee, be entitled to elect to replace such Airframe if, at the
     time that Mortgagee receives the notice referred to above, a Significant
     Default or Event or Default exists) the Company shall, subject to the
     satisfaction of the conditions in (S) 4.05(c), as promptly as possible and
     in any event within 180 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss,
     cause to be subjected to the Lien of this Mortgage, in replacement of such
     Airframe with respect to which the Event of Loss occurred, a Replacement
     Airframe and, for each Engine installed on such Airframe when it suffered
     the Event of Loss, if any, a Replacement Engine therefor, such Replacement
     Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) to be free and clear of all Liens
     except Permitted Liens not of record, and to have a value, utility, and
     remaining useful life (without regard to hours or cycles remaining until
     the next regular maintenance check) at least equal to the Airframe or
     Engine, as the case may be, to be replaced thereby (assuming that such
     Airframe or Engine had been maintained in accordance with this Mortgage);
     provided, that if the Company does not perform its obligation to effect
     such replacement under this clause (1) during the 180-day period, it shall
     pay the amounts required to paid pursuant to and within the time frame
     specified in clause (2) below.

               (2)  If the Company elects to make a payment for such Event of
     Loss to such Airframe, the Company shall make a payment to Mortgagee (or
     notify and direct the Mortgagee that an amount of insurance proceeds held
     by Mortgagee be so applied) for purposes of redeeming one or more Notes (in
     whole or in part) on a date on or before the Business Day following the
     earlier of (aa) the 180th day after the occurrence of such Event of Loss,
     and (bb) the fourth Business Day after the receipt of insurance proceeds
     with respect to such Event of Loss (but in any event not earlier than the
     date of the Company's election under (S) 4.05(a) to make payment under this
     (S) 4.05(a)(2)); and upon the earlier of the receipt by Mortgagee of (i)
     insurance proceeds with respect to such Event or Loss, (ii) such payment or
     (iii) receipt of notice by the Mortgagee that the Company has elected to
     treat the Event of Loss as a Disposition pursuant to (S) 4.05(f), Mortgagee
     shall, at the Company's cost and expense, release from the Lien of this
     Mortgage such Airframe and any Engines installed thereon, by executing and
     delivering to the Company or its insurers all documents that the Company
     reasonably requests to evidence such release. The amount of any such
     payment (or insurance proceeds held by Mortgagee applied in payment) shall
     be equal to the Agreed Value for such Airframe and any Engines installed
     thereon. Upon any such payment (or such application of insurance proceeds)
     by the Company, any excess insurance proceeds plus any gain realized
     thereon as a result of investments required to be made pursuant to Section
     4.3 of the Collateral Trust Agreement shall be promptly paid over to the
     Company provided no Significant Default or Event of Default shall have
     occurred and then be continuing.

               (3)  If the Company elects the replacement option in clause (1)
     above and has not effected such replacement within 60 days after the Event
     of Loss occurred, then the

                                                                         PAGE 21
<PAGE>

     Company shall immediately pay to Mortgagee the amounts required pursuant to
     clause (2) less insurance proceeds received by the Mortgagee, to be held as
     security for the Company's obligations under clause (1). If the Company
     elects the replacement option in clause (1) above, and pays the deposit
     required by the preceding sentence, and has not effected such replacement
     within 180 days after the Event of Loss occurred, then such deposit shall
     be applied to the Company's obligations under clause (2), and the Company
     shall pay any remaining amounts due under clause (2) .

          (b)  Effect of Replacement.  If the Company provides a Replacement
               ---------------------
Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) as provided for in (S) 4.05(a), then (1)
the Lien of this Mortgage shall continue with respect to such Replacement
Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) as though no Event of Loss had occurred;
(2) Mortgagee shall (at the Company's cost and expense) release from the Lien of
this Mortgage the replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) by executing and
delivering to the Company such documents and instruments as the Company
reasonably requests to evidence such release; and (3) in the case of a
replacement upon an Event of Loss, Mortgagee shall assign to the Company all
claims Mortgagee may have against any other Person arising from the Event of
Loss, and the Company shall receive all insurance proceeds (other than those
reserved to others under (S) 4.06(b)) and proceeds from any award in respect of
condemnation, confiscation, seizure, or requisition, including any investment
interest thereon, to the extent not previously applied to the purchase price of
the Replacement Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) as provided in (S)
4.05(d).

          (c)  Conditions to Airframe and Engine Replacement.  The Company's
               ---------------------------------------------
right to substitute a Replacement Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) as
provided in (S) 4.05(a) is subject to the fulfillment, at the Company's sole
cost and expense, in addition to the conditions in (S) 4.05(a), of the following
conditions precedent:

               (1)  on the date when the Replacement Airframe and any
     Replacement Engine(s) are subjected to the Lien of this Mortgage (the
     "Replacement Closing Date"), Mortgagee receives an executed counterpart of
     each of the following documents (or, in the case of the FAA Bill of Sale
     and full warranty bill of sale referred to below, a photocopy thereof):

                    (aa) a supplement to this Mortgage, in form and substance
          reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee, covering the Replacement
          Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s), which is being duly filed for
          recordation pursuant to the Transportation Code or such other
          applicable law of such jurisdiction other than the United States in
          which the Replacement Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) are to be
          registered in accordance with (S) 4.02(e);

                    (bb) an FAA Bill of Sale (or a comparable document, if any,
          of another Aviation Authority, if applicable) covering the Replacement
          Airframe (and any Replacement Engine(s), if required by such
          comparable document) executed by the former owner thereof in favor of
          the Company;

                    (cc) a full warranty (as to title) bill of sale, covering
          the Replacement Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s), executed by

          owner thereof in favor of the Company (or, at the Company's option,
          other evidence of the Company's ownership of such Replacement Airframe
          and any Replacement Engine(s), reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee);
          and

                    (dd) Financing Statements (or any similar statements or
          other documents required to be filed or delivered pursuant to the laws
          of the jurisdiction in which the Replacement Airframe and any
          Replacement Engine(s) may be registered in accordance with (S)
          4.02(e)) as counsel for Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable by to
          protect the security interests of Mortgagee in the Replacement
          Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s);

               (2)  the Replacement Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) are
     of the same model as such Airframe or Engines, or an improved model of such
     aircraft or engines of the manufacturer thereof (and, in the case of a
     Replacement Engine, the same model as the other Engine then installed on
     such Airframe), shall have a value and utility (without regard to hours or
     cycles remaining until the next regular maintenance check) at least equal
     to, and are in as good operating condition and repair as, the Airframe and
     any Engine(s) replaced (assuming such Airframe and Engine(s) had been
     maintained in accordance with this Mortgage);

               (3)  Mortgagee (acting directly or by authorization to its
     special counsel) receives reasonably satisfactory evidence as to the
     compliance with (S) 4.06 with respect to the Replacement Airframe and any
     Replacement Engine(s);

               (4)  on the Replacement Closing Date, (aa) the Company causes the
     Replacement Airframe and any Replacement Engine(s) to be subjected to the
     Lien of this Mortgage free and clear of Liens (other than Permitted Liens),
     (bb) the Replacement Airframe has been duly certified by the FAA as to type
     and (upon registration) is eligible to receive an airworthiness certificate
     in accordance with this Mortgage, and (cc) application for registration of
     the Replacement Airframe in accordance with (S) 4.02(e) is being duly made
     with the FAA or other applicable Aviation Authority and the Company has
     authority to operate the Replacement Airframe;

               (5)  Mortgagee (at the Company's expense) receives (directly or
     through its special counsel) (aa) an opinion of independent counsel,
     addressed to Mortgagee, to the effect that the Replacement Airframe and any
     Replacement Engine(s) has been or are being duly made subject to the Lien
     of this Mortgage and that (assuming the matters covered by the opinion in
     the following clause (bb)) all necessary action has been taken to perfect
     such Lien, the Subsidiary Guarantees and Guarantor Confirmation are in full
     force and effect, and Mortgagee will be entitled to the benefits of Section
     1110 with respect to the Replacement Airframe, provided, that such opinion
     with respect to Section 1110 need not be delivered to the extent that,
     immediately before such replacement, the benefits of Section 1110 were not
     available to Mortgagee in respect of the Airframe or Engine being replaced,
     and (bb) an opinion of the Company's aviation law counsel reasonably
     satisfactory to and addressed to Mortgagee as to the due registration of

     Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engine(s) (other than the Lien of this
     Mortgage), and the due filing for recordation of each supplement to this
     Mortgage with respect to such Replacement Airframe and any Replacement
     Engine(s) under the Transportation Code or such other applicable law of the
     jurisdiction other than the United States in which the Replacement Airframe
     is to be registered in accordance with (S) 4.02(e), and the due filing of
     any Financing Statements or other filings reasonably requested by Mortgagee
     with respect to such Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine(s) under
     applicable Law;

               (6)  if requested by Mortgagee, furnish Mortgagee with evidence
     reasonably satisfactory to it of the value, utility, remaining useful life,
     and estimated residual value of, and good title to, such Replacement
     Airframe and any such Replacement Engine(s) (including an appraisal by a
     qualified independent appraiser selected by the Company and reasonably
     acceptable to the Mortgagee of such value, utility, remaining useful life
     and estimated residual value);

               (7)  assign to Mortgagee the benefit of any assignable
     manufacturers, and vendors, warranties with respect to such Replacement
     Airframe and such Replacement Engine(s);

               (8)  furnish Mortgagee with a Guarantor Confirmation, duly

     Default will exist; and

               (10) take such other action as Mortgagee reasonably requests in
     order that such Replacement Airframe and any such Replacement Engine(s) be
     subjected to the Lien of this Mortgage to the same extent as such Airframe
     and any Engine(s) replaced thereby.

     The Company shall cause an airworthiness certificate, with respect to such
Replacement Airframe, to be duly issued under the Transportation Code promptly
after such substitution.

          (d)  Non-Insurance Payments Received on Account of an Event of Loss.
               --------------------------------------------------------------
Any amounts, other than insurance proceeds in respect of damage or loss not
constituting an Event of Loss (the application of which is provided for in Annex
B), received at any time by Mortgagee or the Company from any Government Entity
or any other Person in respect of any Event of Loss will be held by Mortgagee
and applied as follows:

               (1)  If such amounts are received with respect to an Airframe,
     and any Engine installed thereon at the time of such Event of Loss, upon
     the Company's compliance with the applicable terms of (S) 4.05(a)(1) and
     (S) 4.05(c) with respect to the Event of Loss for which such amounts are
     received or receipt by the Mortgagee of the Company's election to treat
     such Event of Loss as a Disposition pursuant to (S) 4.05(f), such amounts
     shall be paid over to, or (if received after such compliance) retained by,
     the Company;

                                                                         PAGE 24
<PAGE>

               (2)  If such amounts are received with respect to an Engine
     (other than an Engine installed on such Airframe at the time such Airframe
     suffers an Event of Loss), upon the Company's compliance with the
     applicable terms of (S) 4.04(e) with respect to the Event of Loss for which
     such amounts are received or receipt by the Mortgagee of the Company's
     election to treat such Event of Loss as a Disposition pursuant to (S)
     4.05(f), such amounts shall be paid over to, or (if received after such
     compliance) retained by, the Company;

               (3)  If such amounts are received, in whole or in part, with
     respect to an Airframe, and the Company makes, has made or is deemed to
     have made the election in (S) 4.05(a)(2), such amounts shall be applied as
     follows:

                    first, if the sum described in (S) 4.05(a)(2) has not then
                    -----
          been paid in full by the Company, such amounts shall be paid to
          Mortgagee to the extent necessary to pay in full such sum; and

                    second, the remainder, if any, shall be paid to the Company.
                    ------

               (4)  If such amounts are received with respect to Spare Parts
     (and such Spare Parts were not installed on an Airframe at the time such
     Airframe suffers an Event of Loss), such amounts shall be paid over to or
     retained by the Company.

          (e)  Requisition for Use.  If any Government Entity requisitions the
               -------------------
use of any Airframe, any Engine(s) or engine(s) installed on such Airframe while
such Airframe is subject to the Lien of this Mortgage and such requisition does
not constitute an Event of Loss, the Company shall promptly notify Mortgagee of
such requisition, and all of the Company's obligations under this Mortgage shall
continue to the same extent as if such requisition had not occurred. Any
payments received by Mortgagee or the Company or a Permitted Lessee from such
Government Entity with respect to such requisition of use shall be paid over to,
or retained by, the Company. If an Event of Loss to an Engine results from the
requisition for use by a Government Entity of such Engine (but not such
Airframe), the Company will replace such Engine hereunder by complying with (S)
4.04(e) or elect to treat the Event of Loss as a Disposition under (S) 4.05(f),
and any payments received by Mortgagee or the Company from such Government
Entity with respect to such requisition following such compliance shall be paid
over to, or retained by, the Company.

          (f)  Sale of Aircraft, Airframes, Engines or Parts.  Notwithstanding
               ---------------------------------------------
anything herein to the contrary, provided no Significant Default or Event of
Default shall exist, the Company may sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any
Aircraft, Airframe, Engine or Part that it deems surplus to its needs, obsolete,
or otherwise undesirable for use in its business (a "Disposition"), so long as
(i) the Company receives consideration at the time of such Disposition at least
equal to the fair market value (including as to the value of all non-cash
consideration), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an
Officer of the Company, of the assets subject to such Disposition and (ii) if
any non-cash consideration is subject to a lien or encumbrance at the time of
acquisition thereof, the fair market value of such non-cash consideration, plus
the amount of any consideration in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents, less
the amount of all obligations

                                                                         PAGE 25
<PAGE>

secured by such lien or encumbrance, is not less than the fair market value of
the Aircraft, Airframe, Engine and/or Part subject to such Disposition. If at
least eighty percent (80%) of the consideration thereof received by the Company
is not in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents, the Company shall subject to the
Lien of this Mortgage any aircraft, aircraft engines or other flight equipment
acquired in exchange ("Exchanged Flight Equipment") for the Aircraft, Airframe
or Engine subject to a Disposition unless any lien or encumbrance existing on
the Exchanged Flight Equipment at the time of acquisition thereof and to which
the Company takes subject prohibits the Company from subjecting the Exchanged
Flight Equipment to the Lien of this Mortgage. In the event the Company subjects
to the Lien of this Mortgage any Exchanged Flight Equipment, the Lien of this
Mortgage shall constitute a first priority security interest in such Exchanged
Flight Equipment unless the Company acquires the Exchanged Flight Equipment
subject to a prior lien, in which event, the Lien of this Mortgage shall be
junior only to such prior lien and such prior lien shall constitute a Permitted
Lien in respect of the Exchanged flight Equipment only. If the Company engages
in a Disposition, the Company may use the Net Available Cash from such
Disposition, within one (1) year after the later of such Disposition and the
receipt of such Net Available Cash (such later date, the "Trigger Date"), to (i)
permanently repay or prepay any then outstanding Senior Indebtedness of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) invest or acquire (or enter into a
legally binding commitment to invest in or acquire) Additional Assets; provided
that the transaction subject to any such commitment be consummated within 180
days after the date of such commitment. If any such legally binding commitment
to invest in or acquire such Additional Assets is terminated, then the Company
may, within 90 days after such termination or the Trigger Date, whichever is
later, use such Net Available Cash as provided in clause (i) or (ii) without
giving effect to the parenthetical contained in such clause (ii)) above. The
amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth above in this
paragraph constitutes "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds (together with any "Excess Proceeds" under the Indenture) exceeds the
Asset Disposition Basket, the Company shall, within 30 days thereof, apply all
such Excess Proceeds as and to the extent required under Section 5.19(b) of the
Indenture and Section 4 of the Holdings Note Purchase Agreement.

         (g) Certain Payments to be Held As Security.  Any amount referred to in
             ---------------------------------------
this (S) 4.05 or (S) 4.06 which is payable or creditable to, or retainable by,
the Company shall not be paid or credited to or retained by the Company if at
the time of such payment, credit, or retention a Significant Default or an Event
of Default exists, but shall be paid to and held by Mortgagee as security for
the Secured Debt, and at such time as no Significant Default or Event of Default
exists, such amount and any gain realized as a result of investments required to
be made pursuant to (S) 6.06 shall (to the extent not theretofore applied as
provided herein) be paid over to the Company.

    4.06 Insurance

         (a) The Company's Obligation to Insure.  The Company shall comply with,
             ----------------------------------
or cause to be complied with, each of the provisions of Annex B, which
provisions are hereby incorporated by this reference as if set forth in full
herein.

     (b) Insurance for Own Account.  Nothing in this (S) 4.06 shall limit or
         -------------------------
prohibit (a) the

                                                                         PAGE 26
<PAGE>

Company from maintaining the policies of insurance required under Annex B with
higher limits than those specified in Annex B, or (b) Mortgagee from obtaining
insurance for its own account (and any proceeds payable under such separate
insurance shall be payable as provided in the policy relating thereto);
provided, that no insurance may be obtained or maintained that would limit or
otherwise adversely affect the coverage of any insurance required to be obtained
or maintained by the Company pursuant to this (S) 4.06 and Annex B.

     (c) Indemnification by Government in Lieu of Insurance.  During any period
         --------------------------------------------------
of requisition or transfer of an Aircraft or any part thereof by or to the U.S.
Government or any other Government Entity, Mortgagee shall accept, in lieu of
insurance against any risk with respect to such Aircraft described in Annex B,
indemnification from, or insurance provided by, the U.S. Government, or upon
Mortgagee's written consent, another Government Entity, against such risk in an
amount that, when added to the amount of insurance (including permitted self-
insurance), if any, against such risk that the Company (or any Permitted Lessee)
may continue to maintain, in accordance with this (S) 4.06, during the period of
such requisition or transfer, shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance
against such risk otherwise required by this (S) 4.06.

     (d) Application of Insurance Proceeds. All insurance proceeds received as a
         ---------------------------------
result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss to any Aircraft or any Engine or
other loss to any Spare Parts under policies required to be maintained by the
Company pursuant to this (S) 4.06 will be applied in accordance with (S) 4.05(d)
or (S) 4.05(f) .  All proceeds of insurance required to be maintained by the
Company, in accordance with this (S) 4.06 and (S) B of Annex B, in respect of
any property damage or loss not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to
any Aircraft, any Airframe, any Engine or any Spare Parts will be held by
Mortgagee and applied concurrently with repairs or replacement to pay (or to
reimburse the Company) for repairs (which may be applied in progress payments as
such repairs are made) or for replacement property, and any balance remaining
after such repairs or replacement with respect to such damage or loss shall be
paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

                     ARTICLE V EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES

     5.01 Event of Default

     "Event of Default" means an "Event of Default" (as defined in the
Collateral Trust Agreement).

     5.02 Remedies

     (a) If an Event of Default exists, then, and in every such case, Mortgagee
may exercise any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any and all of the
remedies pursuant to this Article V and Article III of the Collateral Trust
Agreement, and shall have and may exercise all of the rights and remedies of a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, and may take possession of all
or any part of the properties covered or intended to be covered by the Lien
created hereby or pursuant hereto, and may exclude the Company and all Persons
claiming under it wholly or partly therefrom; provided, that Mortgagee shall
give the Company 10 days' prior written notice of its intention to sell one or
more of the Aircraft or other Collateral (or any part

                                                                         PAGE 27
<PAGE>

thereof). Without limiting any of the foregoing, Mortgagee may exercise any
right of sale of any Aircraft available to it, even if it will not have taken
possession of such Aircraft and will not have possession thereof at the time of
such sale.

     (b)  The Holders shall be entitled, at any sale pursuant to this (S) 5.02,
to credit against any purchase price bid at such sale by such Holder all or any
part of the unpaid Secured Debt owed to such Holder.

     (c)  If the Collateral (or any part thereof) is sold pursuant to any
judgment or decree of any court or otherwise in connection with the enforcement
of this Mortgage, the unpaid Secured Debt shall immediately become due and
payable without presentment, demand, protest, or notice, all of which are hereby
waived.

     5.03 Return of Aircraft, etc.

          (a)   If an Event of Default exists and the Secured Debt has been
accelerated, at Mortgagee's request, the Company shall promptly execute and
deliver to Mortgagee such instruments of title and other documents as Mortgagee
shall request to enable Mortgagee or an agent or representative designated by
Mortgagee, at such time or times and place or places as Mortgagee shall specify,
to obtain possession of all or any part of the Collateral to which Mortgagee
shall at the time be entitled hereunder.  If the Company for any reason fails to
execute and deliver such instruments and documents after such request by
Mortgagee, Mortgagee may (1) obtain a judgment conferring on Mortgagee the right
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute and deliver such
instruments and documents to Mortgagee, to the entry of which judgment the
Company hereby specifically consents to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and
(2) pursue all or part of such Collateral wherever it may be found, and enter
any of the premises of the Company wherever such Collateral may be or be
supposed to be, and search for such Collateral and take possession of and remove
such Collateral.  All Expenses of obtaining such judgment or of pursuing,
searching for, and taking such property shall, until paid, be secured by the
Lien of this Mortgage.

          (b) Upon every such taking of possession, Mortgagee may, from time to
time, at the expense of the Collateral, make all such expenditures for
maintenance, use, operation, storage, insurance, leasing, control, management,
disposition, modification, or alteration to and of the Collateral, as it deems
proper. In each such case, Mortgagee shall have the right to maintain, use,
operate, store, insure, lease, control, manage, dispose of, modify, or alter the
Collateral, and to exercise all rights and powers of the Company relating to the
Collateral, as Mortgagee deems best, including the right to enter into any and
all such agreements with respect to the maintenance, use, operation, storage,
insurance, leasing, control, management, disposition, modification, or
alteration of the Collateral or any part thereof as Mortgagee shall determine,
and Mortgagee shall be entitled to collect and receive directly all rents,
revenues, and other proceeds of the Collateral and every part thereof, without
prejudice, however, to Mortgagee's right under any provision of this Mortgage to
collect and receive all cash held by, or required to be deposited with,
Mortgagee hereunder. Such rents, revenues, and other proceeds shall be applied
to pay the expenses of the maintenance, use, operation, storage, insurance,
leasing, control, management, disposition, improvement, modification, or
alteration of the Collateral and of conducting the

                                                                         PAGE 28
<PAGE>

business thereof, and to make all payments which Mortgagee is required or elects
to make (if any) for Taxes, assessments, insurance, or other proper charges upon
the Collateral or any part thereof (including the employment of engineers and
accountants to examine, inspect, and make reports upon the Company's properties
and books and records), and all other payments which Mortgagee is required or
authorized to make under any provision of this Mortgage, as well as just and
reasonable compensation for the services of Mortgagee, and of all Persons
properly engaged and employed by Mortgagee with respect hereto.

     5.04 Remedies Cumulative

     Each and every right, power, and remedy given to Mortgagee specifically or
otherwise in this Mortgage shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other right, power, and remedy herein specifically given or now or hereafter
existing at Law, in equity, or by statute, and each and every right, power, and
remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised
from time to time and as often and in such order as Mortgagee deems expedient,
and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any right, power, or remedy
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time
or thereafter any other right, power, or remedy.  No delay or omission by
Mortgagee in the exercise of any right, remedy, or power or in the pursuance of
any remedy shall impair any such right, power, or remedy or be construed to be a
waiver of any default on the part of the Company or to be an acquiescence
therein.

     5.05 Discontinuance of Proceedings

     If Mortgagee institutes any proceeding to enforce any right, power, or
remedy under this Mortgage by foreclosure, entry, or otherwise, and such
proceedings are discontinued or abandoned for any reason or is determined
adversely to Mortgagee, then and in every such case the Company and Mortgagee
shall, subject to any determination in such proceedings, be restored to their
former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral, and all
rights, remedies, and powers of the Company or Mortgagee shall continue as if no
such proceedings had been instituted.

     5.06 Appointment of Receiver

     If an Event of Default exists and the Secured Debt has been accelerated,
Mortgagee shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to the appointment of a
receiver (who may be Mortgagee or any successor or nominee thereof) for all or
any part of the Collateral, whether such receivership be incidental to a
proposed sale of the Collateral or the taking of possession thereof or
otherwise, and the Company hereby consents to the appointment of such a receiver
and will not oppose any such appointment.  Any receiver appointed for all or any
part of the Collateral shall be entitled to exercise all the rights and powers
of Mortgagee with respect to the Collateral.

     5.07 Mortgagee Authorized to Execute Bills of Sale, etc.

     The Company irrevocably appoints, while an Event of Default exists,
Mortgagee as the Company's true and lawful attorney-in-fact (which appointment
is coupled with an interest), in

                                                                         PAGE 29
<PAGE>

the Company's name and stead and on its behalf, for the purpose of effectuating
any sale, assignment, transfer, or delivery for the enforcement of the Lien of
this Mortgage, whether pursuant to foreclosure or power of sale, assignments,
and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate, with full power of
substitution, the Company hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney
or any substitute shall do by virtue hereof in accordance with applicable Law.
Nevertheless, if so requested by Mortgagee or any purchaser, the Company shall
ratify and confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer, or delivery, by
executing and delivering to Mortgagee or such purchaser all bills of sale,
assignments, releases, and other proper instruments to effect such ratification
and confirmation as designated in any such request.

                       ARTICLE VI     MORTGAGEE'S DUTIES

     6.01 No Duties Except as Specified in Mortgage or Instructions

     Mortgagee shall not have any duty or obligation to use, operate, store,

to discharge all Liens on any part of the Collateral which result from claims
against Trust Company not related to the administration of the Collateral or any
other transaction pursuant to this Mortgage or any document included in the
Collateral.

     6.02 No Action Except Under Mortgage or Instructions

     Mortgagee will not use, operate, store, lease, control, manage, sell,

     Neither Mortgagee nor Trust Company makes, nor shall either be deemed to
have made, and each hereby expressly disclaims, any representation or warranty
(express or implied) as to the title, airworthiness, value, compliance with
specifications, condition, design, quality, durability, operation,

                                    ANNEX B

                                   INSURANCE


     The terms defined in Annex A to the Mortgage, when capitalized as in Annex
A, have the same meanings when used in this "Insurance" Annex.  Annex A also
contains rules of usage that control construction in this "Insurance" Annex.

A.   Liability Insurance

     1.   Except as provided in (S) A2 below, the Company will carry or cause to
be carried at all times, at no expense to Mortgagee or any Holder, comprehensive
airline legal liability insurance (including passenger liability, property
damage, and contractual liability insurance) with respect to each Aircraft,
Airframe and Engine, which is (a) in an amount not less than the greater of (x)
the amount of comprehensive airline legal liability insurance from time to time
applicable to aircraft operated by the Company of the same type and operating on
similar routes as such Aircraft, and (y) the Minimum Liability Insurance Amount
per occurrence; (b) of the type and covering the same risks as from time to time
applicable to aircraft operated by the Company of the same type as such
Aircraft; and (c) maintained in effect with insurers of nationally or
internationally recognized responsibility (such insurers being referred to
herein as "Approved Insurers").

     2.   During any period that any Aircraft is on the ground and not in
operation, the Company may carry or cause to be carried, in lieu of the
insurance required by (S) A1 above, insurance otherwise conforming with the
provisions of (S) A1 except that (a) the amounts of coverage shall not be
required to exceed the amounts of public liability and property damage insurance
from time to time applicable to aircraft operated by the Company of the same
type as such Aircraft which are on the ground and not in operation, and (b) the
scope of the risks covered and the type of insurance shall be the same as from
time to time shall be applicable to aircraft operated by the Company of the same
type which are on the ground and not in operation.

B.   Hull Insurance

     1.   Except as provided in (S) B2 below, the Company will carry or cause to
be carried at all times, at no expense to Mortgagee or any Holder, with Approved
Insurers "all-risk" ground and flight aircraft hull insurance covering each
Aircraft (including the Engines when they are installed on an Airframe or any
other airframe) which is of the type as from time to time applicable to aircraft
operated by the Company of the same type as such Aircraft for an amount
denominated in United States Dollars not less than the applicable Agreed Value
(as the same may be annually adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof).
<PAGE>

     Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with this (S) B1 covering
such Aircraft and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
such policies (a) shall name Mortgagee as loss payee for the account of all
interests for any proceeds to be paid under such policies up to an amount equal
to the Agreed Value, and (b) shall provide that (aa) in the event of a loss
involving proceeds in excess of the Threshold Amount, the proceeds in respect of
such loss up to an amount equal to the Agreed Value shall be payable to
Mortgagee, except in the case of a loss with respect to an Engine installed on
an airframe other than an Airframe, in which case the Company (or any Permitted
Lessee) shall endeavor to arrange for any payment of insurance proceeds in
respect of such loss to be held for the account of Mortgagee whether such
payment is made to the Company (or any Permitted Lessee) or any third party and,
if Mortgagee receives such a payment otherwise than in respect of an Event of
Loss, then, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to Mortgagee that the damage
giving rise to such payment has been repaired or that such payment is then
required to pay for repairs then being made, Mortgagee shall, unless a Default
or Event or Default exists, pay the amount of such payment to the Company or its
order, and (bb) the entire amount of any loss involving proceeds of the
Threshold Amount or less or the amount of any proceeds of any loss in excess of
the Agreed Value shall be paid to the Company or its order unless a Default or
Event or Default exists and the insurers have been notified thereof by
Mortgagee.  In the case of a loss with respect to an engine (other than an
Engine) installed on an Airframe, Mortgagee shall hold any payment to it of any
insurance proceeds in respect of such loss for the account of the Company or any
other third party who is entitled to receive such proceeds.

     2.   During any period that any Aircraft is on the ground and not in
operation, the Company may carry or cause to be carried, in lieu of the
insurance required by (S) B1 above, insurance otherwise conforming with the
provisions of (S) B1, except that the scope of the risks and the type of
insurance shall be the same as from time to time applicable to aircraft operated
by the Company of the same type similarly on the ground and not in operation,
provided, that the Company shall maintain insurance against risk of loss or
damage to such Aircraft in an amount equal to the Agreed Value during such
period that such Aircraft is on the ground and not in operation.

C.   War-Risk, Hijacking, and Allied Perils Insurance

     If the Company (or any Permitted Lessee) operates or proposes to operate an
Aircraft, an Airframe, or any Engine (1) in any area of recognized hostilities
or (2) on international routes and the Company (or such Permitted Lessee)
maintains war-risk, hijacking, or allied perils insurance for other aircraft
that it operates on such routes, the Company shall maintain or cause to be
maintained war-risk, hijacking, and related perils insurance of substantially
the same type carried by major United States commercial air carriers operating
the same or comparable models of aircraft on similar routes or in such areas,
and in no event in an amount less than (x) the amount set forth in (S) A with
respect to liability coverage and (y) the values stated in (S) B1 and B2 with
respect to hull coverage.  In any event, the Company shall maintain or cause a
Permitted Lessee to maintain the "Common North American Airline Buyback" to the
War Exclusion Clause (or London or other equivalent) war risk perils buyback.

                                                                         PAGE 48
<PAGE>

to Mortgagee or any Holder, with Approved Insurers spares all risks insurance
covering Engines and Parts, including Spare Engines and Spare Parts, while
removed from an Aircraft, in an aggregate amount not less than the full
replacement value of such Engine or Part (the "Spares Insured Value").

     Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with this (S) D covering
such Engines and Parts and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement
for any such policies (a) shall name Mortgagee as exclusive loss payee for any
proceeds to be paid under such policies up to an amount equal to the Spares
Insured Value for the applicable Engine or Part, and (b) shall provide that in
the event of a loss, the proceeds in respect of such loss for such Engine or
Part shall be payable to the Company, unless a Default or Event or Default
exists and the insurers have been notified thereof by Mortgagee.

E.   General Provisions

     Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with (S)(S) A, B, C and D,
including any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for such
policies:

               (1)  shall name Mortgagee and each Holder, (identified by
     description, not by name) as an additional insured (collectively, the
     "Additional Insureds"), as their interests may appear;

               (2)  shall apply worldwide and have no territorial restrictions
     or limitations (except only in the case of war, hijacking, and related
     perils insurance required under (S) C, which shall apply to the extent
     available on commercially reasonable terms in the major international
     aviation insurance markets);

               (3)  shall provide that, in respect of the interests of the
     Additional Insureds in such policies, the insurance shall not be
     invalidated or impaired by any act or omission (including misrepresentation
     and nondisclosure) by the Company (or any Permitted Lessee) or any other
     Person (including use for illegal purposes of any Aircraft or any Engine),
     and shall insure the Additional Insureds regardless of any breach or
     violation of any representation, warranty, declaration, term, or condition
     in such policies by the Company (or any Permitted Lessee);

               (4)  shall provide that, if the insurers cancel such insurance
     for any reason whatsoever, or if it is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of
     premium, or if any material change is made in the insurance which adversely
     affects the interest of any of the Additional Insureds, such cancellation,
     lapse, or change shall not be effective as to the Additional Insureds for
     30 days (seven days in the case of war risk, hijacking, and allied perils
     insurance) after receipt by the Additional Insureds of written notice by
     such insurers of such cancellation, lapse, or change, provided, that if any
     notice period specified above is not reasonably obtainable, such policies
     shall provide for as long a

                                                                         PAGE 49
<PAGE>

     period of prior notice as shall then be reasonably obtainable;

               (5)  shall waive any rights of setoff (including for unpaid
     premiums), recoupment, counterclaim, or other deduction, whether by
     attachment or otherwise, against each Additional Insured;

               (6)  shall waive any right of recourse, subrogation, setoff,
     recoupment, counterclaim, or other deduction against any Additional
     Insured;

               (7)  shall be primary without right of contribution from any
     other insurance that may be available to any Additional Insured;

               (8)  shall provide that all of the liability insurance provisions
     thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in all respects as
     if a separate policy had been issued covering each party insured
     thereunder;

               (9)  shall provide that none of the Additional Insureds shall be
     liable for any insurance premium; and

               (10) shall contain a 50/50% Clause per Lloyd's Aviation
     Underwriters' Association Standard Policy Form AVS 103;

provided, that any such endorsements may be subject to any limitations on
endorsements generally prevailing in the airline insurance marketplace at the
time.

F.   Reports and Certificates; Other Information

     On or before the Issuance Date and on or before each renewal date of the
insurance policies required hereunder, the Company will furnish or cause to be
furnished to Mortgagee insurance certificates describing in reasonable detail
the insurance maintained by the Company hereunder and a report, signed by the
Company's regular independent insurance broker (the "Insurance Broker"), stating
the opinion in customary form of such Insurance Broker that (a) all premiums in
connection with the insurance then due have been paid, and (b) such insurance
complies with this Annex B.  To the extent such agreement is reasonably
obtainable, the Company will also cause the Insurance Broker to agree to advise
Mortgagee in writing of any default in the payment of any premium, and to notify
Mortgagee in writing at least 30 days (seven days in the case of war-risk and
allied perils coverage, or such shorter period as may be available in the major
international aviation insurance markets, as applicable) before the
cancellation, lapse, or materially adverse change of any insurance maintained
pursuant to this Annex B.

G.   Right to Pay Premiums

     The Additional Insureds shall have the rights but not the obligations of an
additional named insured.  None of Mortgagee and the other Additional Insured
shall have any obligation to pay any premium, commission, assessment, or call
due on any such insurance (including reinsurance).  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of cancellation of any insurance due to

                                                                         PAGE 50

<PAGE>

the nonpayment of premiums, Mortgagee shall have the option, in its sole
discretion,, to pay any such premium in respect of one or more of the Aircraft
that is due in respect of the coverage pursuant to this Mortgage and to maintain
such coverage, as Mortgagee may require, until the scheduled expiry date of such
insurance and, in such event, the Company shall, upon demand, reimburse
Mortgagee for amounts that it so pays.

H.   Deductibles; Self-Insurance

     The Company may self-insure by way of deductible, premium adjustment,
franchise provisions, or otherwise (including, with respect to insurance
maintained pursuant to (S) B, insuring for a maximum amount which is less than
the Agreed Value) in the insurance covering the risks required to be insured
against pursuant to (S) 4.06 of the Mortgage and this Annex B under a program
applicable to all aircraft in the Company's fleet, but in no case shall the
aggregate amount of self-insurance in regard to (S) 11 of the Mortgage and this
Annex B exceed $1 million per occurrence, or, if greater, the lesser per policy
year with respect to all of the aircraft in the Company's fleet (including each
Aircraft of (x) 4% of the consolidated tangible net worth of Holdings at the
time (based on the latest publicly-available financial statements at the time
that the insurance is placed) and (y) the value of the single most valuable
aircraft in the Company's fleet), unless an insurance broker of national
standing shall certify that the standard among the majority of major U.S.
airlines is a higher level of self-insurance, in which case the Company may
self-insure to such higher level.  In addition, the Company (and any Permitted
Lessee) may self-insure to the extent of any applicable deductible per aircraft
that does not exceed industry standards for major U.S. airlines.

                                                                         PAGE 51
