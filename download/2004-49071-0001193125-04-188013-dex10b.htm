Purchasing Bank, pursuant to this subsection 10.6(d), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Company shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Bank and new Notes or, as appropriate,
replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchasing Bank, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their Commitment Percentages or, as appropriate, their outstanding Loans as adjusted pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Bank hereunder without the consent of the Company or the Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without
