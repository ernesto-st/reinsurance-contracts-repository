          Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to
          the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together

Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuer of any Letter of Credit the amount of           all
Reimbursement Obligations owing to such Issuer under any Letter of Credit
          issued for its account no later than the date that is the next succeeding
          Business Day after the Borrower receives written notice from such Issuer that
          payment has been requested by the beneficiary thereof and such payment shall be
          made by such Issuer under such Letter of Credit (the &#147;<I>Reimbursement
          Date</I>&#148;), irrespective of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
that           the Borrower may have at any time against such Issuer or any other Person.
In           the event that any Issuer makes any payment under any Letter of Credit and
the           Borrower shall not have repaid such amount to such Issuer pursuant to this
<I>clause&nbsp;(h)</I> or any such payment by the Borrower is rescinded or set
          aside for any reason, such Reimbursement Obligation shall be payable on demand
          with interest thereon computed (i)&nbsp;from the date on which such
          Reimbursement Obligation arose to the Reimbursement Date, at the rate of
          interest applicable during such period to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate
          Loans and (ii)&nbsp;from the Reimbursement Date until the date of repayment in
          full, at the rate of interest applicable during such period to past due
          Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans, and such Issuer shall promptly notify
          the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit
          Lender of such failure, and each Revolving Credit Lender shall promptly and
          unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer
          the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender&#146;s Ratable Portion of such
          payment (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof if such payment was made in any
          currency other than Dollars) in immediately available Dollars. If the
          Administrative Agent so notifies such Revolving Credit Lender prior to
          11:00&nbsp;a.m. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Revolving Credit
          Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
          Issuer its Ratable Portion of the amount of such payment on such Business Day
in           immediately available funds. Upon such payment by a Revolving Credit Lender,
          such Revolving Credit Lender shall, except during the continuance of a Default
          or Event of Default under <I>Section 9.1(f) (Events of Default)</I> and
          notwithstanding whether or not the conditions precedent set forth in <I>Section

been           satisfied (which conditions precedent the Revolving Credit Lenders hereby
          irrevocably waive), be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to the Borrower in
          the principal amount of such payment. Whenever any Issuer receives from the
          Borrower a payment of a Reimbursement Obligation as to which the Administrative
          Agent has received for the account of such Issuer any payment from a Revolving
          Credit Lender pursuant to<I></I>this<I> clause&nbsp;(h)</I>, such Issuer shall
          pay over to the Administrative Agent any amount received in excess of such
          Reimbursement Obligation and, upon receipt of such amount, the Administrative
          Agent shall promptly pay over to each Revolving Credit Lender, in immediately
          available funds, an amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lender&#146;s Ratable
          Portion of the amount of such payment adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the
          respective amounts the Revolving Credit Lenders have paid in respect of such
          Reimbursement Obligation.  </FONT></P>

Portion of the amount of the payment required by <I>clause&nbsp;(h)</I>          available
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuer, such           Revolving
Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the           account of such
Issuer forthwith on demand any such unpaid amount together with           interest
thereon, for the first Business Day after payment was first due at the           Federal
Funds Rate and, thereafter, until such amount is repaid to the           Administrative
