          Section 1.03. Types of Borrowings. The term "Borrowing" refers to the
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Loans of any Class outstanding
hereunder which bears interest of a specific Type and for a specific Interest
Period pursuant to a notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender's
ratable share of each Borrowing is referred to herein as a separate "Loan."
Borrowings, Loans, Letters of Credit and certain related terms hereunder may be
distinguished by "Class" and by "Type." The "Class" of a Loan or of a Commitment
to make such a Loan or of a Borrowing comprising such Loans or of a Letter of
Credit refers to whether such Loan is a Tranche A Revolving Loan, a Tranche B
Revolving Loan or a Tranche B Term Loan, each of which constitutes a Class. The
"Class" of a Letter of Credit refers to whether such Letter of Credit is a
Tranche A Letter of Credit or a Tranche B Letter of Credit, each of which
constitutes a Class. The "Type" of a Loan refers to whether such Loan is an ABR
Loan or a Eurodollar Loan. Borrowings and Loans may (but need not) be identified
both by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Tranche A Revolving Loan" is a Loan
which is both a Tranche A Revolving Loan and a Eurodollar Loan).

each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Tranche A Revolving Loans
to the Borrower, at any time and from time to time during the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) such
Lender's Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment over (B) its Tranche A Letter of
Credit Exposure at such time and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) such Lender's
Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing Base at such
time over (B) its Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure at such time, provided
that, in no event shall the Lenders be required to make any Tranche A Revolving
Loans if, after giving effect to such Loans, the sum of (I) the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Tranche A Revolving Loans on any date plus (II)
the Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure on such date exceed the aggregate
Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments of all the Lenders.

          (b) Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the

(ii) its Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure at such time, provided that, in no
event shall the Lenders be required to make any Tranche B Revolving Loans if,
after giving effect to such Loans, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans on any date plus (B) the Tranche B

                                                                              42

Option") by written notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) to convert all or a
portion of the Tranche B Revolving Term Loans outstanding on the Tranche B

Tranche B Conversion Date and (ii) subject to the terms of Section 2.21(b), to
request an extension of the expiration of any Tranche B Letter of Credit
outstanding on the Tranche B Term-Out Effective Date to a date no later than the

Tranche B Term-Out Option shall become effective on the Tranche B Term-Out
Effective Date upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of an Officers'
Certificate, dated as of the Tranche B Term-Out Effective Date, certifying as of
such date, that:

          (i) the ratio of Parent Consolidated Funded Debt to Parent
     Consolidated Cash Flow as of the Tranche B Term-Out Effective Date shall be
     no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 (together with supporting calculations and pro
     forma financial statements demonstrating compliance with such condition to
     the satisfaction of the Agents);

          (ii) neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have made
     any Restricted Payment since the date of the most recent Borrowing or
     issuance of Letter of Credit if, on the date of such Restricted Payment,
     the ratio of (x) Parent Consolidated Cash Flow to (y) Parent Consolidated
     Interest Expense plus the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made by
     the Public Partnership to its equityholders during the Reference Period
     with respect to such date, was less than 0.75 to 1.00 (together with
     supporting calculations and pro forma financial statements demonstrating
     compliance with such condition to the satisfaction of the Agents);

          (iii) on the Tranche B Term-Out Effective Date, the Public Partnership
     and its Subsidiaries shall have in effect weather insurance coverage of at
     least $12,500,000 on a consolidated basis;

          (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
     hereof and the representations and warranties of the Borrower and the other
     Loan Parties set forth in the other Loan Documents shall be true and
     correct in all material respects on and as of the Tranche B Term-Out
     Effective Date with the same effect as though made on and as of such date,
     except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate
     to an earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties shall
     be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier
     date); and

          (v) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing as of the Tranche B Term-Out Effective Date.

          (d) The Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Tranche A
Revolving Loans during the Tranche A Revolving Credit Availability Period,
within the limits set forth in Section 2.01(a) and upon the other terms and
subject to the other conditions and limitations set forth herein. The Borrower
may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Tranche B Revolving Loans during the
Tranche B Revolving Credit Availability Period, within the limits set forth in

limitations set forth herein, provided that, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, at all times the Borrower shall maintain Tranche B Loans
outstanding in a minimum principal

                                                                              43

amount of $500,000 until the earlier of (x) Facility B is terminated in full
through acceleration or otherwise and (y) the Facility Obligations under the
Parity Debt Credit Agreement have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments
under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement have been fully terminated. Amounts paid
or prepaid in respect of Tranche B Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

          Section 2.02. Loans. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a
Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with
their respective Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments or Tranche B Revolving
Credit Commitments, as the case may be; provided, however, that the failure of
any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to
be made by such other Lender). The Loans comprising each Borrowing shall be in
an aggregate principal amount which is (i) an integral multiple of $100,000 and
not less than $500,000 in the case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) an integral
multiple of $100,000 in the case of ABR Loans (or, in the case of ABR Loans, an
aggregate principal amount equal to the remaining balance of the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments or Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments, as the
case may be).

          (b) A particular Borrowing of any Class shall consist solely of ABR
Loans or Eurodollar Loans of such Class, as the Borrower may request pursuant to
Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option fulfill its Commitment with respect
to any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of
such Lender to make such Loan; provided that, any exercise of such option shall
not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Note. Borrowings of more than one
Type and Eurodollar Loans bearing interest for more than one specific Interest
Period may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would result in
an aggregate of more than five separate Eurodollar Loans of any Lender being
outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the foregoing, Loans
having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the
same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

          (c) Each Lender shall make a Loan in the amount of its pro rata
portion, as determined under Section 2.16, of each Borrowing hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Administrative Agent at the Funding Office, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, and the Administrative Agent shall by 3:00 p.m., New York City time,
credit the amounts so received to the general deposit account of the Borrower
with the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date
because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return
the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.

          (d) If the Administrative Agent has not received from the Borrower the
payment required by Section 2.21(g) by 12:30 p.m., New York City time, on the
date on which the Issuing Bank has notified the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent that payment of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit of any Class
will be made, as provided in Section 2.21(g), the Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Issuing Bank and each Lender of the Letter of Credit
Disbursement of such Class and, in the case of each Lender, its pro rata share
(based on

<PAGE>

                                                                              44

such Lender's Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage and Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Class) of such Letter of Credit
Disbursement. Not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date, each
Lender shall make available its pro rata share, as so determined, of such Letter
of Credit Disbursement, in Federal or other funds immediately available, to the
Administrative Agent at the Funding Office, and the Administrative Agent will
promptly make such funds available to the Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
will promptly remit to each Lender that shall have made such funds available its
pro rata share, as so determined, of any amounts subsequently received by the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit
Disbursement.

          (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or prior to the time of any required
payment by such Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit Disbursement, that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's pro
rata portion of such Borrowing or payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on
the date of such Borrowing or payment in accordance with Section 2.02(c) or (d),
as applicable, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower or Issuing Bank, as applicable, on
such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall
not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender
and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or the Issuing Bank
(or, if the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank are the same Person, from
the date of such payment in respect of a Letter of Credit Disbursement), as
applicable, until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at,
(i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant
to Section 2.06 or Section 2.21(g), as applicable and (ii) in the case of such
Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount in respect of a Borrowing, such
amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.

          (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request (i) any Tranche A Revolving Credit
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Tranche A Maturity Date or (ii) any Tranche B Revolving Credit Borrowing if
the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Tranche B
Conversion Date. Further, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, nor
shall any Lender be required to make, any Eurodollar Loan during the existence
of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree.

          Section 2.03. Notice of Borrowings. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent telephone notice (promptly confirmed in writing or by
telecopy in the form of Exhibit I-1 hereto) (a) in the case of a Eurodollar
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
before a proposed borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the proposed
borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case refer to this
Agreement and specify (i) the applicable Class and Type of such Borrowing; (ii)
the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount
thereof; and (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election as to the
Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing
shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar
Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this
Section 2.03 and of each Lender's pro rata portion of the requested Borrowing.

          Section 2.04. Notes; Repayment of Loans. The Tranche A Revolving Loans
and Tranche B Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by a Tranche A
Revolving Credit Note or a Tranche B Note, as applicable, duly executed and
delivered on behalf of the Borrower, dated the Closing Date, in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 or A-2, as applicable, with the blanks
appropriately filled, payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount
equal to such Lender's Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment (in the case of its
Tranche A Revolving Credit Note) and Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment (in
the case of its Tranche B Note). The outstanding principal balance of each Loan,
as evidenced by the applicable Note, shall be payable (a) in the case of a
Tranche A Revolving Loan, on the Tranche A Maturity Date, (b) subject to Section
2.01(c), in the case of a Tranche B Revolving Loan, on the Tranche B Conversion
Date and (c) in the case of a Tranche B Term Loan, as provided in Section 2.11.
Each Note shall bear interest from the date of the first Borrowing hereunder on
the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.06. Each
Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrower to, endorse on the
schedule attached to each Note delivered to such Lender (or on a continuation of
such schedule attached to such Note and made a part thereof), or otherwise to
record in such Lender's internal records, an appropriate notation evidencing the
date and amount of each applicable Loan from such Lender, each payment and
prepayment of principal of any such Loan, each payment of interest on any such
Loan and the other information provided for on such schedule; provided, however,
that the failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein
shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Notes.

          Section 2.05. Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender, on the last day of March, June, September
and December in each year, and on the last day of the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Availability Period, a commitment fee (a "Tranche A Commitment Fee") on the
average daily unused amount of the Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment of such
Lender during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date
of this Agreement or ending with the last day of the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Availability Period), equal to (i) during any Level I Pricing Period, 0.25% per
annum, (ii) during any Level II Pricing Period, 0.375% per annum and (iii) at
all other times, 0.50% per annum. The "unused amount" of the Tranche A Revolving
Credit Commitment of a Lender on any date means the amount of such Lender's
Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment on such date, less the sum of its
outstanding Tranche A Revolving Loans on such date and its Tranche A Letter of
Credit Exposure on such date. All Tranche A Commitment Fees shall be computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The
Tranche A Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue from the
date of this Agreement and shall cease to accrue on the last day of the Tranche
A Revolving Credit Availability Period.

          (b) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender, on the last day of March, June, September and December in each
year, and on the last day of the Tranche B Revolving Credit Availability Period,

amount of the Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender during the
preceding calendar quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date of this
Agreement or ending with the last day of the Tranche B Revolving Credit
Availability Period), equal to (i) during any Level I Pricing Period, 0.25% per
annum, (ii) during any Level II Pricing Period, 0.375% per annum and (iii) at
all other times, 0.50% per annum. The "unused amount" of the Tranche B Revolving
Credit Commitment of a Lender on any date means the amount of such Lender's
Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment on such date, less the sum of its
outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans on such date and its Tranche B Letter of
Credit Exposure on such date. All Tranche B Commitment Fees shall be computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The
Tranche B Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue from the
date of this Agreement and shall cease to accrue on the last day of the Tranche
A Revolving Credit Availability Period.

          (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, the fees set forth in the Letter Agreement dated August 19, 2003
(the "Letter Agreement"), among the Administrative Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc. and the Borrower, in the amounts and on the dates provided in the Letter
Agreement. Such fees shall be in addition to reimbursement of the Agents'
reasonable out- of-pocket expenses.

          (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

          Section 2.06. Interest on Loans. (a) Subject to Section 2.07, each
Tranche A Revolving Loan comprising an ABR Borrowing shall bear interest for
each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due (computed on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except that,
with respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the
basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis
of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed) at
a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate, plus the Applicable Tranche A
ABR Margin.

          (b) Subject to Section 2.07, each Tranche B Revolving Loan or Tranche
B Term Loan comprising an ABR Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from
the date such Loan is made until it becomes due (computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except that, with respect
to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the
Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or
366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed) at a rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate, plus the Applicable Tranche B ABR
Margin.

          (c) Subject to Section 2.07, each Tranche A Revolving Loan comprising
a Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from the date such Loan
is made until it becomes due (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO
Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, plus the Applicable
Tranche A Eurodollar Margin.

          (d) Subject to Section 2.07, each Tranche B Revolving Loan or Tranche
B Term Loan comprising a Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest for each day
from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due (computed on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum
equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing, plus the Applicable Tranche B Eurodollar Margin.

          (e) Any change in any Applicable Margin required hereunder shall be
deemed to occur (i) five Business Days after the date the Borrower delivers its
financial statements required by Section 5.02(a) or (b), as the case may be, in
respect of its most recent fiscal quarter and the certificate required by
Section 5.02(c) or (ii) on the date any Tranche B Revolving Credit Borrowing is
made or any Tranche B Letter of Credit is issued in respect of the financial
statements required by Section 4.03(a); provided that, if the Borrower fails to
deliver such financial statements and certificate on or before the date such
statements and certificate are required to be delivered pursuant to Section
5.02(a) or (b), as the case may be, and Section 5.02(c), the Applicable Margin
for the period from such required date until the date such statements and
certificate are actually delivered shall be calculated as if a Level III Pricing
Period were in effect, and after the date such statements and certificate are
actually delivered the Applicable Margin shall be determined as otherwise
provided for herein.

          (f) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment
Dates applicable to such Loan, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate for each Interest
Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined
by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

          Section 2.07. Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, by acceleration or
otherwise, interest shall accrue, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount during the period from (and including) the date of such default
to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before
judgment) at (a) in the case of principal or interest on any Loan, the rate per
annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of
360 days) that would otherwise be applicable to such Loan pursuant to Section
2.06 as if a Level III Pricing Period were in effect, plus 2.00% or (b) in the
case of any other amount, a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the rate applicable to
ABR Tranche B Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 as if a Level III Pricing
Period were in effect, plus 2.00%. The Borrower shall pay all such accrued but
unpaid interest from time to time upon demand.

          Section 2.08. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have
determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
such Borrowing are not generally available in the applicable interbank market,
or that the rates at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining
its Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall,
as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or

                                                                              48

telecopy notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the
event of any such determination, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar
Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 or Section 2.10 shall, until the
Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to be a
request for an ABR Borrowing. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          Section 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The
Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments shall be automatically terminated at 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on (i) September 30, 2003, if the Closing hereunder in
accordance with Article IV has not occurred by such date and (ii) otherwise, the
Tranche A Maturity Date. The Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
automatically terminated at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) September 30,
2003, if the Closing hereunder in accordance with Article IV has not occurred by
such date and (ii) otherwise, the Tranche B Conversion Date.

          (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in
whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments and/or the Tranche B Revolving Credit
Commitments; provided, however that (i) upon any such reduction of the Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower simultaneously reduce the Parity Debt
Credit Agreement Facility by a pro rata amount, provided that, the Borrower may,
at its option, elect the aggregate amount of any such reduction to be applied,
first, to the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility, and, second, to Facility B,
and provided further, that in no event shall the outstanding Indebtedness under
the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility be reduced to an amount less than
$2,000,000 (unless the Facility Obligations under the Parity Credit Agreement
Facility is paid in full in cash and the commitments under such Facility are
fully terminated), (ii) each partial reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitments of any Class shall be in a minimum collective aggregate principal
amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000,
(iii) the Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments may not be so terminated in
whole or in part unless and until (A) the Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments
have been terminated in whole, (B) the Tranche B Revolving Loans and Tranche B
Term Loans, together with interest, fees and all other obligations in respect
thereof, have been paid in full, (C) all Tranche B Letters of Credit (other than
any such Letters of Credit for which the Borrower has deposited with the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement an amount in cash
equal to 100% of the undrawn amount of such Letters of Credit as provided in
Section 2.21(k)) have been cancelled or have expired and (D) all Tranche B
Letter of Credit Disbursements have been reimbursed in full and (iv) no such
termination or reduction of Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments or Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto
and to any prepayments of the related Loans made on the effective date thereof,
(x) in the case of a termination or reduction of the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Commitments, the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Tranche A
Revolving Loans on the date of such reduction plus the Tranche A Letter of
Credit Exposure on such date would exceed the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Commitments, (y) in the case of a termination or reduction of the Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitments, the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of Tranche B Revolving Loans on the date of such reduction plus the
Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure on such date would exceed the Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitments or

                                                                              49

(z) the aggregate outstanding Indebtedness under Facility B shall be reduced to
an amount less than $500,000 unless the Facility Obligations under the Parity
Debt Credit Agreement have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments (as
defined in the Parity Debt Credit Agreement) have been fully terminated.

          (c) In the event, and on each occasion, that the Borrower is required
to prepay or repay Tranche A Revolving Loans and/or to provide cash collateral
for Tranche A Letters of Credit as provided in Section 2.11(e) or (f) and
Section 2.11(h), then on the date of such required action, the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced by
an amount equal to the sum of such required payment and cash collateral. In the
event, and on each occasion, that the Borrower is required to prepay or repay
Tranche B Revolving Loans and/or to provide cash collateral for Tranche B
Letters of Credit as provided in Section 2.11(e) or (f) and Section 2.11(h),
then on the date of such required action, the Tranche B Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal to
the sum of such required payment and cash collateral; provided, however, that
(i) the Borrower simultaneously reduce the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility
by a pro rata portion of the amount of such prepayment or reduction determined
pursuant to the allocation method set forth in Section 4(d)(ii) of the
Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in no event shall any such reduction or
prepayment reduce either (x) the outstanding Indebtedness under Facility B to an
amount less than $500,000 or (y) the outstanding Indebtedness under the Parity
Debt Credit Agreement Facility to an amount less than $2,000,000, in each case,
unless the Facility Obligations under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement are
simultaneously paid in full in cash and the Commitments (as defined in the
Parity Debt Credit Agreement) are terminated in full. In addition, the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments and the Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments
shall be automatically and permanently reduced by the amount of Excess Proceeds
referred to in paragraph (e) or (f) of Section 2.11 which is allocable to reduce
such Commitments as provided in Section 2.11(h). For purposes of applying the
requirements of this Section 2.09(c), the amount of any Excess Proceeds referred
to in paragraph (e) or (f) of Section 2.11 which is allocable to the Facilities
Obligations shall be calculated as if the definition set forth in the last
sentence of Section 2.11(e) included, in addition, the maximum aggregate amount
of the unused Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments.

          (d) Each reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class in
accordance with this Article II shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class. The
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders,
on the date of each termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments
of any Class, the Commitment Fees on the amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments of such Class so terminated or reduced accrued to the date of such
termination or reduction.

          Section 2.10. Conversion and Continuation of Borrowings. The Borrower
shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent (a) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
Business Day of conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into an ABR
Borrowing, (b) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business
Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Borrowing into a
Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing as a Eurodollar
Borrowing for an additional Interest Period and (c) not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three

Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the Interest Period with respect
to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period, subject in
each case to the following:

          (i) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata among the
     Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans
     comprising the converted or continued Borrowing;

          (ii) the aggregate principal amount of such Borrowing converted into
     or continued as (A) a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall be an integral multiple
     of $100,000 and not less than $500,000 or (B) an ABR Borrowing, shall be
     the lesser of (I) the remaining outstanding principal amount of such
     Borrowing and (II) an integral multiple of $100,000;

          (iii) each conversion or continuation shall be effected by each Lender
     by applying the proceeds of the new Loan of such Lender resulting from such
     conversion or continuation to the Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender
     being converted or continued; accrued interest on a Eurodollar Loan (or
     portion thereof) being converted or continued shall be paid by the Borrower
     at the time of conversion;

          (iv) if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted or continued at a time
     other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower
     shall pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders pursuant to Section
     2.15;

          (v) any portion of a Borrowing maturing or required to be repaid in
     less than one month may not be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar
     Borrowing;

          (vi) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, during the existence
     of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall not be entitled to
     elect to have any Borrowing converted into or continued as a Eurodollar
     Borrowing;

          (vii) any portion of a Borrowing which cannot be converted into or
     continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing by reason of clause (v) or (vi) above
     shall be automatically converted at the end of the Interest Period in
     effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing;

          (viii) no Interest Period may be selected for any Tranche A Revolving
     Credit Borrowing that is a Eurodollar Borrowing that would end later than
     the Tranche A Maturity Date; and

          (ix) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar Tranche B
     Term Borrowing that would end later than a Tranche B Repayment Date
     occurring on or after the first day of such Interest Period if, after
     giving effect to such selection, the aggregate outstanding amount of (A)
     Eurodollar Tranche B Term Borrowings with Interest Periods ending on or
     prior to such Tranche B Repayment Date and (B) the ABR Tranche B Term
     Borrowings would not be at least equal to the principal amount of Tranche B
     Term Borrowings to be paid on such Tranche B Repayment Date.

          Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be irrevocable and
shall refer to this Agreement and specify (I) the principal amount, the Type
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period of the Borrowing
that the Borrower requests be converted or continued, (II) whether such
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR
Borrowing, (III) if such notice requests a conversion, the date of such
conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (IV) if such Borrowing is to be
converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with
respect thereto. If no Interest Period is specified in any such notice with
respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise the other Lenders of any notice
given pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each Lender's pro rata portion of any
converted or continued Borrowing. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with this Section 2.10 to continue any Borrowing into a subsequent
Interest Period (and shall not otherwise have given notice in accordance with
this Section 2.10 to convert such Borrowing), such Borrowing shall, at the end
of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms
hereof), automatically be continued into a new Interest Period as an ABR
Borrowing.

          Section 2.11. Mandatory Repayments and Prepayments. (a) On the Tranche
A Maturity Date, all Tranche A Revolving Credit Borrowings shall be due and
payable to the extent not previously paid.

          (b) On the Tranche B Conversion Date, all Tranche B Revolving Credit
Borrowings not converted into Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(c)
shall be due and payable to the extent not previously paid.

          (c) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.11(h) and Section
2.12(b), the Borrower shall repay the Tranche B Term Loans and reduce the
Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure in quarterly installments, commencing on
December 31, 2006, and continuing on the last day of every third calendar month
thereafter through September 30, 2008 (the due date of each such installment
being called a "Tranche B Repayment Date"), provided that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the
aggregate amount of outstanding Indebtedness under Facility B be less than
$500,000 until the Facility Obligations under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement
have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments (as defined in the Parity
Debt Credit Agreement) have been fully terminated. The amount of any such
installment payable on a Tranche B Repayment Date shall, subject to the proviso
in the preceding sentence, be the amount, if any, necessary (after giving effect
to any reductions on account of the expiration after the Tranche B Conversion
Date of any Tranche B Letters of Credit) to reduce the sum of (i) the aggregate
principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans outstanding immediately after the
Tranche B Conversion Date and (ii) the Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure
outstanding immediately after the Tranche B Conversion Date by an aggregate
percentage of such sum equal to the percentage set forth opposite such Repayment
Date below:

December 31, 2006      12.5%
March 30, 2007         25.0%
June 30, 2007          37.5%
September 30, 2007     50.0%

                                                                              52

December 31, 2007      62.5%
March 31, 2008         75.0%
June 30, 2008          87.5%
September 30, 2008   100.00%

On the Tranche B Repayment Date that is September 30, 2008, the Borrower shall
repay the remaining principal and interest owing on all outstanding Tranche B
Term Loans and fully cash collateralize any then existing Tranche B Letter of
Credit Exposure. All payments under this paragraph (c) shall be applied (I)
first, to repay any outstanding Tranche B Term Loans and (II) second, after the
Tranche B Term Loans have been paid in full, to reduce the Tranche B Letter of
Credit Exposure. Any such payments so applied to reduce the Tranche B Letter of
Credit Exposure shall be deposited with the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
Cash Collateral Agreement as provided in Section 2.21(k).

          (d) During each year, the Borrower will cause a period of at least 30
consecutive days to occur, at any time between March 1 and August 31 of such
year, during which no Tranche A Revolving Credit Borrowings shall be
outstanding.

          (e) If at any time the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
disposes of property or such property shall be damaged, destroyed or taken in
eminent domain or there shall be title insurance proceeds with respect to such
property, in any such case, with the result that there are Excess Proceeds, and
the Borrower does not apply such Excess Proceeds in the manner described in
Section 6.07(c)(iii)(B)(I), the Borrower shall prepay, upon notice as provided
in paragraph (g) of this Section 2.11 (which notice shall be given not later
than 180 days after the date of such sale of property), a principal amount of
the outstanding Facilities Obligations equal to the amount of such remaining
Excess Proceeds allocable to the Facilities Obligations, determined by
allocating such remaining Excess Proceeds pro rata among the Lenders and the
holders of Parity Debt, if any, outstanding on the date such prepayment is to be
made, according to the aggregate then unpaid principal amounts of the Facilities
Obligations and Parity Debt (and the Make Whole Amount on the principal amount
of the Mortgage Notes to be prepaid) in accordance with the allocation method
set forth in Section 4(d)(ii) of the Intercreditor Agreement. For purposes of
this Section 2.11, the "aggregate then unpaid principal amount of the Facilities
Obligations" shall equal the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Loans, (ii) the Letter of Credit Exposure and (iii) the maximum
aggregate amount of the unused Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments.

          (f) In the event that damage, destruction or a taking shall occur in
respect of all or a portion of the properties subject to any of the Collateral
Documents, or there shall be proceeds under title insurance policies with
respect to any real property, all Net Insurance Proceeds (as defined in the
Mortgage), self-insurance amounts, Net Awards (as defined in the Mortgage) or
title insurance proceeds which, as of any date, shall not theretofore have been
applied to the cost of Restoration (as defined in the Mortgage) shall be deemed
to be proceeds of property disposed of voluntarily, shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 6.07(c) and, if subdivision (iii)(B)(I) of Section 6.07(c)
is applicable thereto, shall be subject to the prepayment provisions of
paragraph (e) of this Section 2.11; provided that, if any such event or
circumstances (individually or together with all other related events and
circumstances) shall result in proceeds of more than $25,000,000 in the
aggregate, the Borrower shall not apply such

<PAGE>

                                                                              53

proceeds to replacement or other assets or undertake any Restoration without the
prior written consent of the Required Lenders.

          (g) The Borrower will give the Administrative Agent irrevocable
written notice of each prepayment under paragraph (e) or (f) of this Section
2.11 not less than ten days and not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed
for such prepayment, in each case specifying such prepayment date, the aggregate
principal amount of the Facilities Obligations to be prepaid, the principal
amount of each issue of Parity Debt to be prepaid and the paragraph under which
such prepayment is to be made. Each Lender shall receive, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the date scheduled for any such prepayment, a certificate
of a Financial Officer of the Borrower certifying that the applicable conditions
of this Section 2.11 have been fulfilled and specifying the particulars of such
fulfillment. Such certificate shall set forth the principal amount of the
Facilities Obligations being prepaid and specify how such amount was determined,
and certify that such amount has been computed in accordance with this Section
2.11.

          (h) All mandatory prepayments of the Facilities Obligations under
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 2.11 shall be applied (i) first, to pay
or prepay any outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans or Tranche B Term Loans and,
to the extent that the remaining amount of such prepayment is greater than the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche B Loans, to reduce the Tranche
B Letter of Credit Exposure, (ii) second, to permanently reduce any remaining
unused Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments as contemplated by Section
2.09(c), (iii) third, to pay or prepay any outstanding Tranche A Revolving
Loans, and (iv) fourth, to permanently reduce any remaining unused Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09(c), provided that,
in the event that any such prepayment would reduce the outstanding Indebtedness
under Facility B to an amount less than $500,000 prior to the date that the
Facility Obligations under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement have been paid in
full in cash and the Commitments (as defined in the Parity Debt Credit
Agreement) have been fully terminated, an amount equal to the excess of the (x)
amount of such prepayment minus (y) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Tranche B Loans on the date of such prepayment or reduction plus the
Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure on such date shall be deposited with the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement as provided in
Section 2.21(k). All such mandatory prepayments so applied on or after the
Tranche B Conversion Date shall be applied to reduce the amount of scheduled
payments due under Section 2.11(c) after the date of such prepayment in the
inverse order of maturity (without affecting the requirement that such
prepayments be applied first to pay all outstanding Tranche B Term Loans and
only thereafter to reduce the Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure). Subject to
the foregoing provisions, any such mandatory prepayment of Loans of any Class
shall be applied to prepay all ABR Loans of such Class before any Eurodollar
Loans of such Class are prepaid. Any such payments under paragraphs (e) and (f)
of this Section 2.11 so applied to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure shall be
deposited with the Trustee and applied as provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

          (i) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Revolving Loans on any
date and (ii) the Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure on such date exceeds the
lesser of (A) the aggregate amount of the Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments
at such time, (B) the Borrowing Base at such

                                                                              54

time, and (C) the Borrowing Base as calculated pursuant to Section
10.1(e)(ii)(3)(y) of the Note Agreements, the Borrower shall immediately prepay
Tranche A Revolving Loans (and, to the extent that the amount of such excess is
greater than the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche A Revolving
Loans, reduce the Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure by making a deposit with
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement as provided
in Section 2.21(k)) in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess.

          (j) In the event and on any date that the ratio of Consolidated Cash
Flow to Consolidated Interest Expense (in each case, as defined in the Note
Agreements) is less than 2.0 to 1.0, the Borrower will repay the Tranche A
Revolving Loans and cash collateralize Tranche A Letters of Credit to the extent
necessary so that the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Revolving Loans on such date plus
(ii) the Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure on such date shall not exceed
$18,000,000 (and, to the extent that the amount of such prepayment exceeds the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche A Revolving Loans, the
Borrower shall deposit with the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash
Collateral Agreement as provided in Section 2.21(k) an amount equal to such
excess).

          (k) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Revolving Loans on any
date and (ii) the Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure on such date exceeds the
aggregate amount of the Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, the
Borrower shall immediately prepay Tranche B Revolving Loans (and, to the extent
that the amount of such excess is greater than the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans, reduce the Tranche B Letter of Credit
Exposure by making a deposit with the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash
Collateral Agreement as provided in Section 2.21(k)) in an aggregate principal
amount equal to such excess.

          (l) Each payment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount paid to but excluding
the date of payment. The repayments and prepayments of the Loans required by the
respective subsections of this Section 2.11 and the optional prepayments
permitted by Section 2.12 are separate and cumulative, so that any one such
repayment or prepayment shall reduce any other repayment or prepayment only as
and to the extent expressly specified herein. All payments under this Section
2.11 shall be subject to Section 2.15, but otherwise shall be without premium or
penalty.

          Section 2.12. Optional Prepayments. (a) Subject to Section 2.01(d) and
Section 2.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing or payment due under Section 2.11(c), in whole or
in part, upon prior written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly
confirmed by written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent (i) in the
case of any prepayment of amounts payable under Section 2.11(c), not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days in advance of the proposed
prepayment, (ii) in the case of any prepayment of Eurodollar Revolving Loans,
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days in advance of
the proposed prepayment and (iii) in the case of any prepayment of ABR Revolving
Loans, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day of the
proposed prepayment; provided, however, that (A) to the extent the Borrower
prepays Facility B, the Borrower simultaneously

<PAGE>

                                                                              55

reduce the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility pro rata, such that the
prepayments made pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(a) of the
Parity Debt Credit Agreement shall be in equal dollar amounts, provided that,
the Borrower may, at its option, elect the aggregate amount of such prepayments
to be applied, first, to the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility, and, second,
to Facility B, and provided further, that in no event shall (x) the aggregate
outstanding Indebtedness under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility be
reduced to an amount less than $2,000,000 and (y) the aggregate outstanding
Indebtedness under Facility B be reduced to an amount less than $500,000 unless
the Facility Obligations under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement have been paid
in full in cash and the Commitments (as defined in the Parity Debt Credit
Agreement) have been fully terminated, (B) each partial prepayment of ABR Loans
shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 under each of Facility B and
the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility, (C) each partial prepayment of
Eurodollar Loans shall be in an amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000
under each of Facility B and the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility and not
less than $500,000 under each of Facility B and the Parity Debt Credit Agreement
Facility and (D) a partial prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing under this
Section 2.12(a) shall not be made that would result in the remaining aggregate
outstanding principal amount thereof being less than $500,000, in the case of
Facility A, and being less than $500,000 under each of Facility B and the Parity
Debt Credit Agreement Facility, in the case of Facility B. Each notice of
prepayment of any Borrowing or payment due under Section 2.11(c) shall specify
the prepayment date, the Class, the Type and the Interest Period of the
Borrowing to be prepaid (in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing), and the
principal amount thereof to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit
the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing or payment by the amount stated therein on
the date stated therein.

          (b) All prepayments under this Section 2.12 shall be subject to
Section 2.15 but otherwise shall be without premium or penalty. All prepayments
under this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the
principal amount being prepaid to, but excluding, the date of payment. All
prepayments under this Section 2.12 of amounts payable under Section 2.11(c)
shall be applied to reduce the amount of scheduled payments of amounts due under
Section 2.11(c) after the date of such prepayment in the inverse order of
maturity (without affecting the requirement that such prepayments be applied
first to pay all outstanding Tranche B Term Loans and only thereafter to provide
cash collateral in respect of Tranche B Letters of Credit) until the last four
of such scheduled payments shall have been repaid in full, and thereafter all
such prepayments of amounts payable under Section 2.11(c) shall be applied to
reduce such remaining scheduled payments pro rata. Subject to the foregoing
provisions, any optional prepayment of Loans of any Class pursuant to Section
2.12(a) shall be applied to prepay all ABR Loans of such Class before any
Eurodollar Loans of such Class are prepaid.

          Section 2.13. Reserve Requirements; Certain Changes in Circumstances.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the
principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any Fees
or other amounts payable hereunder (other than changes in respect of taxes
imposed on the overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which
such Lender has its principal office or by any political subdivision or taxing
authority therein), or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any

<PAGE>

                                                                              56

reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of or credit extended by such Lender (except any such reserve
requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or shall impose on
such Lender or the applicable interbank market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender, and the result of any of
the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender hereunder or under the Notes (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise) or Letters of Credit by an amount deemed by such Lender
to be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
upon demand such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the
date hereof of any law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation
or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or
any Lender's holding company with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or
the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto to a level below that which such
Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies
and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Lender's holding company to
be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender upon
demand such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or amounts
as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company as
specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered
by it within ten days after its receipt of the same.

          (d) No Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section
2.13 for any costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date
unless such Lender shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand
compensation for such costs or reductions not more than 120 days after the later
of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which such Lender becomes aware of such
costs or reductions. Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or
reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to any other
period. The protection of this Section 2.13 shall be available to each Lender
regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of
the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change, condition or circumstances
which shall have occurred or been imposed.

                                                                              57

          Section 2.14. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the
interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as
contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written or
telecopy notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender
may:

          (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by such
     Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar
     Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR
     Borrowing unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

          (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be
     converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be
     automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
     notice as provided in Section 2.14(b).

In the event that any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii)
above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been
applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender
or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to
repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the
conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

          (b) For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the Borrower by any
Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day
of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all
other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the
Borrower.

          Section 2.15. Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of any
borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any
failure by the Borrower to borrow or to refinance, convert or continue any Loan
hereunder after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, refinancing, conversion or
continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03 or Section 2.10, (c) any
payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date other
than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any default in
payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or
interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due date thereof,
whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or
otherwise) or (e) the occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each
such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be
sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties
acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurodollar
Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount equal to the
excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of
obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed,
refinanced, converted or continued or not paid or prepaid (assumed to be the
Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of such
payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow, refinance, convert or
continue or failure to pay or prepay to the last day of the Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in

<PAGE>

                                                                              58

the case of a failure to borrow, refinance, convert or continue, the Interest
Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure)
over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that
would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid,
converted or not borrowed, refinanced, converted or continued for such period or
Interest Period, as the case may be based upon the purchase of debt securities
customarily issued by the Treasury of the United States of America which have a
maturity date approximating the last Business Day of such Interest Period). A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it
within ten days after its receipt of the same.

          Section 2.16. Pro Rata Treatment. Except as required under Section
2.13 or Section 2.14 and by the terms of this Agreement requiring pro rata
treatment with the Parity Debt Credit Agreement Facility, each Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on
the Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each reduction of the
Commitments, each payment in respect of participations in Letter of Credit
Disbursements and each refinancing of any Borrowing with, conversion of any
Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall
be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitments of the applicable Class (or, if such Commitments shall have expired
or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their
outstanding Loans of the applicable Class). Each Lender agrees that in computing
such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative
Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's share of such Borrowing,
computed in accordance with Schedule 1.01A, to the next higher or lower whole
dollar amount.

          Section 2.17. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against
the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law or otherwise (except pursuant to Section 2.20),
or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of
any Loan or Loans as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans
of any Class shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of
the Loans of such Class of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously
to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay
to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in such Loans of
such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans
and participations in Loans of any Class held by each Lender shall be in the
same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans of such
Class then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans of such Class prior
to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to
the principal amount of all Loans of such Class outstanding prior to such
exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided,
however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made
pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the payment giving rise thereto shall
thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be
rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or
adjustment restored without interest (unless the party from which such recovery
is made is obligated by law to pay interest on the amount recovered, in which
case each of the Lenders shall

<PAGE>

                                                                              59

be responsible for its pro rata share of such interest). The Borrower expressly
consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a
participation in a Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and
all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all
moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if
such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

          Section 2.18. Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment
(including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other
amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 (noon),
New York City time, on the date when due in dollars to the Administrative Agent
at the Funding Office, in immediately available funds. Any such payment received
after such time on any date shall be deemed made on the next Business Day.

          (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a
Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or Fees, if applicable.

          Section 2.19. Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this
Agreement, the Notes and the Letters of Credit shall be made free and clear of,
and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future
income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, assessments,
fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes
and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent
or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between such Agent
or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such
tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other
than any such connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or
enforced, this Agreement, the Notes or any Letters of Credit). If any such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions or
withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld
from any amounts payable to any such Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the
Notes or any Letters of Credit, the amounts so payable to such Agent or such
Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Agent or such
Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any
such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in
this Agreement, the Notes and any Letters of Credit, provided, however, that the
Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any
Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a
state thereof if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of Section
2.19(d).

          (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as
promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative
Agent for its own

<PAGE>

                                                                              60

account or for the account of any Agent or such other Lender, as the case may
be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower
showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes
when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and the Lenders for any
incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agents
or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

          (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined
in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the
Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two
copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or,
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of
Exhibit L and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming
complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on
all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or
before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In
addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S.
Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously
delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification
adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to
deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not
legally able to complete and deliver.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 2.19 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Agent or any Lender.

          (f) Any Agent or Lender claiming any indemnity payment or additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or
document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or
change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity
payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
sole determination of such Agent or Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.

          (g) Nothing contained in this Section 2.19 shall require any Agent or
Lender to make available any of its tax returns (or any other information that
it deems to be confidential or proprietary).

<PAGE>

                                                                              61

          (h) No Lender shall be entitled to claim any indemnity payment or
additional amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 with respect to any tax
unless such Lender shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand
compensation for such payment or amount not more than 120 days after the later
of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which such Lender becomes aware of the
costs or reductions giving rise to such claim. Failure on the part of any Lender
to demand any indemnity payment or any such additional amount with respect to
any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand
compensation with respect to any other period. The protection of this Section
2.19 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of
the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or
other change, condition or circumstances which shall have occurred or been
imposed.

          Section 2.20. Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances.
In the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or certificate
pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.14, or the Borrower shall be required to
pay additional amounts to any Lender under Section 2.19, the Borrower shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the provisions set forth in Section 9.04,
including clause (v) of the proviso to Section 9.04(b)) all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement to another financial institution
designated by the Borrower which shall assume such obligations; provided that
(i) in the case of an assignment under Facility B, a similar assignment by such
Lender be made under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement of all of its interests,
rights and obligations under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement, (ii) no such
assignment shall conflict with any law, rule, regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority and (iii) the Borrower shall pay to the affected Lender
(and, in the case of assignments under Facility B, shall take the same actions
under the Parity Debt Credit Agreement) in immediately available funds on the
date of such assignment the entire amount of principal of and interest accrued
to the date of payment on the Loans and participations in Letter of Credit
Disbursements made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account
or owed to it hereunder; provided, further, that if prior to any such assignment
the circumstances or event that resulted in such Lender's notice or certificate
under Section 2.13 or Section 2.14 or demand for additional amounts under
Section 2.19, as the case may be, shall cease to exist or become inapplicable
for any reason or if such Lender shall waive its rights in respect of such
circumstances or event under Section 2.13, Section 2.14 or Section 2.19, as the
case may be, then such Lender shall not thereafter be required to make any such
assignment hereunder, or in the case of assignments under Facility B, under the
Parity Debt Credit Agreement.

          Section 2.21. Letters of Credit. (a) The Borrower may request the
issuance of Tranche A Letters of Credit, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, for the account of the Borrower, at
any time and from time to time during the Tranche A Revolving Credit
Availability Period; provided that any Tranche A Letter of Credit shall be
issued only if, and each request by the Borrower for the issuance of any Tranche
A Letter of Credit shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Borrower
that, immediately following the issuance of such Letter of Credit, the sum of
(i) the Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure and (ii) the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Tranche A Revolving Loans shall not exceed the lesser of
(A) the aggregate amount of the Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitments at such
time and (B) the Borrowing Base at such time, provided that, in no event

<PAGE>

                                                                              62

shall the sum (I) of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche A
Revolving Loans on the date of such issuance plus (II) the aggregate amount of
the Tranche A Letter of Credit Exposure on such date exceed the aggregate
Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment of all the Lenders. Each Tranche A Letter
of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Tranche A Maturity Date and (ii) the
first anniversary of the date of issuance of such Tranche A Letter of Credit,
unless such Tranche A Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date,
provided that, any Tranche A Letter of Credit with an expiration date on the
first anniversary of such Tranche A Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal
thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond
the date referred to in clause (i) above). Each Letter of Credit shall provide
for payments of drawings in dollars.

          (b) The Borrower may request the issuance of the Tranche B Letters of
Credit, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Bank, for the account of the Borrower, at any time and from time to time
during the Tranche B Revolving Credit Availability Period; provided that any
Tranche B Letter of Credit shall be issued only if, and each request by the
Borrower for the issuance of any Tranche B Letter of Credit shall be deemed a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that, immediately following the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, the sum of (i) the Tranche B Letter of Credit
Exposure and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche B
Revolving Loans shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Tranche B Revolving
Credit Commitments at such time; provided that, in no event shall the sum of (A)
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans on the
date of such issuance plus (B) the aggregate amount of Tranche B Letter of
Credit Exposure on such date exceed the aggregate Tranche B Revolving Credit
Commitment of all the Lenders and, provided, further, that the amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit (as defined in the Parity Debt Credit Agreement)
and the Tranche B Letters of Credit shall not exceed $12,500,000. Each Tranche B
Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of (i) the
date that is five Business Days prior to the Tranche B Conversion Date (or, if
the Tranche B Term-Out Option has become effective pursuant to Section 2.02(c),
five Business Days prior to the Tranche B Maturity Date) and (ii) the first
anniversary of the date of issuance of such Tranche B Letter of Credit, unless
such Tranche B Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date,
provided that, any Tranche B Letter of Credit with an expiration date on the
first anniversary of such Tranche B Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal
thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond
the date referred to in clause (i) above). Each Letter of Credit shall provide
for payments of drawings in dollars.

          (c) Each issuance of any Letter of Credit shall be made on at least
two Business Days' prior irrevocable written or telecopy notice (or such shorter
notice as shall be acceptable to the Issuing Bank) from the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank specifying, on the Issuing Bank's
standard form or on such other form as is acceptable to the Issuing Bank, the
date of issuance, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire, the
amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit, whether such Letter of Credit is a Tranche A Letter of Credit
or a Tranche B Letter of Credit, and such other information as may be necessary
or desirable to complete such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank will give the
Administrative Agent prompt notice of the issuance and amount of such Letter of
Credit and the expiration date of such Letter of Credit (and the Administrative
Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to each Lender). The Issuing Bank also
will give the

                                                                              63

Administrative Agent a quarterly summary indicating the issuance of any Letter
of Credit and the amount thereof, the expiration of any Letter of Credit and the
amount thereof and the payment on any draft presented under any Letter of
Credit. The Administrative Agent will promptly provide the Lenders with copies
of each such quarterly summary.

          (d) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further
action on the part of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
in respect thereof, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each
Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, effective upon the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to (i) in
the case of any such Tranche A Letter of Credit, such Lender's pro rata share
(based on such Lender's Tranche A Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage) of the
aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Tranche A Letter of Credit and
(ii) in the case of any such Tranche B Letter of Credit, such Lender's pro rata
share (based on such Lender's Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage)
of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Tranche B Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, on
behalf of the Issuing Bank, in accordance with Section 2.02(d), (A) such
Lender's pro rata share (based on such Lender's Tranche A Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage) of each Tranche A Letter of Credit Disbursement made by
the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower when due in accordance with
Section 2.21(g) and (B) such Lender's pro rata share (based on such Lender's
Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage) of each Tranche B Letter of
Credit Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower
when due in accordance with Section 2.21(g); provided that the Lenders shall not
be obligated to make any such payment with respect to any wrongful Letter of
Credit Disbursement made as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Issuing Bank.

          (e) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to Section 2.21(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of
Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever (subject only to the proviso set forth in
Section 2.21(d)).

          (f) During the Tranche A Revolving Credit Availability Period, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on the last day of March, June,
September and December in each year and on the date on which the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Commitments shall be terminated as provided herein, (i) for the
account of the Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Tranche A Revolving
Credit Commitments, a fee on the average daily aggregate amount available to be
drawn under all outstanding Tranche A Letters of Credit during the preceding
quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date of this Agreement) at a rate
per annum equal to the Applicable Tranche A Eurodollar Margin from time to time
in effect during such period pursuant to Section 2.06 and (ii) for the account
of the Issuing Bank, a fee on the average daily aggregate amount available to be
drawn under all outstanding Tranche A Letters of Credit during the preceding
quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date of this Agreement) at a rate
per annum equal to 0.125 %. During the Tranche B Revolving Credit Availability
Period, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on the last day of
March, June, September and December in each year and on the date on which the
Tranche B Revolving Credit

                                                                              64

Commitments shall be terminated as provided herein, (i) for the account of the
Lenders, ratably in proportion to their Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitments,
a fee on the average daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under all
outstanding Tranche B Letters of Credit during the preceding quarter (or shorter
period commencing with the date of this Agreement) at a rate per annum equal to
the Applicable Tranche B Eurodollar Margin from time to time in effect during
such period pursuant to Section 2.06 and (ii) for the account of the Issuing
Bank, a fee on the average daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under
all outstanding Tranche B Letters of Credit during the preceding quarter (or
shorter period commencing with the date of this Agreement) at a rate per annum
equal to 0.125%. Such fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Such fees shall accrue from and including
the date of this Agreement to but excluding the last day of the Tranche A
Revolving Credit Availability Period or the Tranche B Revolving Credit
Availability Period, as applicable. In addition to the foregoing, the Borrower
shall pay directly to the Issuing Bank, for its account, payable within 15 days
after demand therefor by the Issuing Bank, the Issuing Bank's customary
processing and documentation fees in connection with the issuance or amendment
of or payment on any Letter of Credit.

          (g) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any
payment or disbursement made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, by
making payment in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent, in an
amount equal to the amount of such payment or disbursement, not later than 12:00
noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives
notice of such draft, if such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00
a.m., New York City time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the
Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such
notice, plus interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by the Issuing Bank, to
the extent not reimbursed prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of
such payment or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to
but excluding the date the Issuing Bank is reimbursed by the Borrower therefor,
at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of amounts due in respect of
Tranche A Letters of Credit, the rate applicable to ABR Tranche A Revolving
Loans during such period pursuant to Section 2.06 and (ii) in the case of
amounts due in respect of Tranche B Letters of Credit, the rate applicable to
ABR Tranche B Revolving Loans during such period pursuant to Section 2.06. If
the Borrower shall fail to pay any amount required to be paid by it under this
Section 2.21(g) when due, such unpaid amount shall bear interest as provided in
Section 2.07. The Issuing Bank shall give the Borrower prompt notice of each
drawing under any Letter of Credit, provided that the failure to give any such
notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the Borrower's obligations
hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall promptly pay any such amounts received
by it to the Issuing Bank.

          (h) The Borrower's obligation to reimburse Letter of Credit
Disbursements as provided in Section 2.21(g) shall be absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or
     any other Loan Document;

<PAGE>

                                                                              65

          (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
     the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person may at any time have
     against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank, any
     Agent, any Lender or any other Person in connection with this Agreement,
     any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or
     transaction;

          (iii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit
     proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
     failing to comply with the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary
     Credits, as in effect from time to time, or any statement therein being
     untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

          (iv) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a draft or other document which does not comply with the
     terms of such Letter of Credit; provided that such payment was not
     wrongfully made as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct
     of the Issuing Bank; and

          (v) any other act or omission or delay of any kind or any other
     circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
     foregoing and whether or not foreseeable, that might, but for the
     provisions of this Section 2.21(h), constitute a legal or equitable
     discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

          (i) It is expressly understood and agreed that, for purposes of
determining whether a wrongful payment under a Letter of Credit resulted from
the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct, (i) the Issuing
Bank's acceptance of documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, (ii) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the
documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters
set forth therein, including the amount of any draft presented under such Letter
of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals
the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to
such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect (so long as such
document on its face appears to be in order), and whether or not any other
statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit
proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate
or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (iii) any noncompliance in any
immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with
the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute willful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank. It is further understood and
agreed that, notwithstanding the proviso to clause (iv) of Section 2.21(h), the
Borrower's obligation hereunder to reimburse Letter of Credit Disbursements will
not be excused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank
to the extent that such Letter of Credit Disbursement actually discharged a
liability of, or otherwise benefited, or was recovered by, the Borrower;
provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank
from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful
misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a
Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.

          (j) The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof,
examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit, including as

<PAGE>

                                                                              66

to compliance with the Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits, as
then in effect. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give telephonic
notification, confirmed by telex or telecopy, to the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make a Letter of Credit Disbursement thereunder, provided that the failure
to give such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse any such Letter of Credit Disbursement in accordance with this Section
2.21. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender notice thereof.

          (k) In the event that the Borrower is required or elects pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (other than Section 2.11(h) and Section 7.01) to
provide cash collateral in respect of the Letter of Credit Exposure of any
Class, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent an
amount in cash equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure of such Class (or such
lesser amount as shall be required or elected hereunder). Any such deposit shall
be held by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Cash Collateral
Agreement. In the event that the Borrower is required pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.11(h) or Section 7.01 of this Agreement to provide cash collateral in
respect of the Letter of Credit Exposure of any Class, the Borrower shall
deposit such cash collateral in an account with the Trustee pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement. Such deposit shall be held by the Trustee in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement. Any such deposit to be held by the
Administrative Agent or the Trustee, as provided herein, shall be accompanied by
notice from the Borrower, in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or
the Trustee, as the case may be, setting forth the basis for such deposit,
identifying in reasonable detail the Letters of Credit to which such deposit
relates, and setting forth any other information related to such deposit
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Trustee, as the case may
be. The Borrower shall promptly provide the Administrative Agent with a copy of
any such notice to the Trustee and shall promptly provide the Trustee with a
copy of any such notice to the Borrower.

Sheet"). The Pro Forma Balance Sheet presents fairly the financial condition of
the Borrower as of that date in accordance with GAAP.

          (c) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders (i) (x) the

<PAGE>

                                                                              69

normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the
related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP

under the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Parity Debt Credit
Agreement, the balance sheets and the notes thereto included in the Audited
Financial Statements disclose all material liabilities, actual or contingent, of
the Loan Parties as of the dates thereof. Except for borrowings under the
Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Parity Debt Credit Agreement and
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date thereof

Effect), the Borrower does not have any material guarantee obligations,
contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or
unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign
currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of
derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements
referred to in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing representation made
in the two immediately preceding sentences, such representation will be deemed
breached (except for purposes of Article IV hereof) only to the extent that such
representation involves undisclosed liabilities which could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Audited Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto).

          Section 3.06. No Material Adverse Change. As of the Closing Date,
there has occurred since September 30, 2002, no material adverse change, and
there exists no condition, event or occurrence that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change,
in the business, operations, property or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Loan Parties. Since the date of this Agreement, there has occurred no
condition, event or other occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had, and there exists no condition, event or other occurrence, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect.

and assets set forth on Schedule 3.07(a) is material to the Business. Each of
the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to,

<PAGE>

                                                                              70

and effect. Each of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful
and undisturbed possession under all such material leases.

          Section 3.08. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.08 sets forth as of the Closing
Date a list of all the Subsidiaries, the respective jurisdictions of
organization thereof and the percentage ownership interest, direct or indirect,

forth in Schedule 3.09, there are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in
equity or by or before any Governmental Authority now pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower, any
other Loan Party or any business, property or rights of the Borrower or any
other Loan Party (i) which involve any Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable
possibility of an adverse determination and which, if adversely determined,
could be reasonably expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party is in violation of
any law, rule or regulation, or in default with respect to any judgment, writ,
injunction or decree, of any Governmental Authority, where such violation or
default could be reasonably expected to result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.09,

the Parity Debt Credit Agreement and the other Parity Debt Agreements were true
and correct on and as of the date of such agreement and will be true and correct
in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all material
respects on and as of such earlier date).

          Section 3.16. Employee Benefit Plans. Except as disclosed in Schedule
3.16, none of the General Partner, the Borrower or any Related Person of the
General Partner or the Borrower has ever established, maintained, contributed to
or been obligated to contribute to, and neither the Borrower nor any Related
Person of the Borrower has any liability or obligation with respect to, any
Plan. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.16, neither the Borrower nor any Related
Person of the Borrower has assumed, either by agreement (including the
Partnership Agreement and the Operative Agreements), by operation of law or
otherwise, any liability or obligation with respect to any "employee benefit
plan" (as defined in ERISA) or any other compensation or benefit arrangement,
agreement, policy, practice or understanding. Neither the General Partner, nor
the Borrower nor any Related Person of the Borrower or the General Partner has
incurred any material liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Plan
and no event or condition exists or has occurred as a result of which such a
liability could reasonably be expected to be incurred. None of the General
Partner, the Borrower nor any Related Person of the General Partner or the
Borrower has engaged in any transaction, including the transactions contemplated
hereunder, which could subject the Borrower or any Related Person of the
Borrower to liability pursuant to Section 4069(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA. There has
been no reportable event (within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA) or any
other event or condition with respect to any Plan which presents a risk of the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Plan by
the PBGC. No prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) exists or has occurred with respect to any Plan
which has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject the General
Partner or the Borrower to a material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l)
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. No liability to the PBGC (other than
liability for premiums not yet due) has been or is expected to be incurred with
regard to any Plan by the General Partner, the Borrower or any Related Person.
Neither the General Partner, nor the Borrower nor any Related Person of the
General Partner or the Borrower contributes or is obligated to contribute or has
ever contributed or been obligated to contribute to any Single Employer Plan
that has at least two contributing sponsors not under common control. The
Borrower is not, nor is it expected to become, a "substantial employer" as
defined in Section 4001(a)(2) of ERISA with respect to any Plan. Neither the
General Partner nor the Borrower has ever maintained or contributed to any plan
or arrangement which provides post-employment welfare benefits or coverage
(other than continuation coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code). With respect to any post-employment welfare benefit plan or arrangement
(other than continuation coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code) established, maintained, or contributed to, by any Related Person (or with
respect to which a Related Person is obligated to contribute), (i) the FAS 106
liabilities and the assumptions used therefor accurately reflect the costs
associated with the rights and benefits of all participants and (ii) such
benefits may be terminated at any time without liability to the Borrower,
General Partner or any Related Party.

          Section 3.17. Environmental and Safety Matters. (a) Each of the
Borrower and the General Partner is in compliance with all Environmental Laws
applicable to it or to the Business or Assets except where such noncompliance
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has timely and properly
applied for renewal of all environmental permits or licenses that have expired
or are about to expire and are necessary for the conduct of the Business as now
conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except where the failure to timely
and properly reapply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.17
lists (i) all notices from Federal, state or local environmental agencies to the
Borrower, the General Partner or any Affiliate thereof citing environmental
violations affecting the Business or Assets that have not been finally resolved
and disposed of, and no such violation, whether or not notice regarding such
violation is listed on Schedule 3.17, if ultimately resolved against such party,
would have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) all current reports filed by the
Borrower, the General Partner or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the
Business or Assets with any Federal, state or local environmental agency having
jurisdiction over the Assets, true and complete copies of which reports have
been made available to the Lenders. Notwithstanding any such notice, except for
matters the consequences of which will not have a Material Adverse Effect, the
Business and Assets are currently being operated in all respects within the
limits set forth in such environmental permits or licenses and any current
noncompliance with such permits or licenses will not result in any liability or
penalty to the Borrower or the Subsidiaries or in the revocation, loss or
termination of any such environmental permits or licenses.

          (b) All facilities located on the real property owned or leased by the
Loan Parties which are subject to regulation by RCRA are and have been operated
in compliance with RCRA, except where such noncompliance would not have a
Material Adverse Effect and none of the Borrower, the General Partner and their
Affiliates has received, or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, been threatened
with, a notice of violation of RCRA regarding such facilities.

          (c) No Hazardous Materials are or have been located or present at any
of the real property owned or leased by the Loan Parties or any previously owned
properties in violation of any Environmental Law, which violation will have a
Material Adverse Effect, or in such circumstances as to give rise to liability,
which liability will have a Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to such
real property there has not occurred (i) any release or threatened release of
any such hazardous substance, (ii) any discharge or threatened discharge of any
substance into ground, surface, or navigable waters which violates any
Environmental Law or (iii) any assertion of any lien pursuant to Environmental
Laws resulting from any use, spill, discharge or clean-up of any hazardous or
toxic substance or waste, which occurrence referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) above will have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) The Borrower has not received notice that it has been identified
as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any comparable state, local
or foreign law nor has the Borrower received any notification that any Hazardous
Materials that it has used, generated, stored, treated, handled, transported or
disposed of or arranged for transport for disposal or treatment of, or arranged
for disposal or treatment of, has been found at any site at which any
Governmental Authority or private party is conducting or plans to conduct a
remedial investigation or other action pursuant to any Environmental Law.

Secured Parties will at all times have the Liens provided for in the Collateral
Documents and, subject to the filing by the Trustee of continuation statements
to the extent required by the Uniform Commercial Code, the Collateral Documents
will at all times constitute a valid and continuing lien of record and first
priority perfected security interest in all the Collateral referred to therein.
No filings or recordings, or amendments or supplements to any of the Collateral
Documents, are required in order to perfect the security interests created under
the Collateral Documents, except for amendments, supplements, filings or
recordings listed on Schedule 3.18. All such amendments, supplements, listed
filings and recordings were made on or prior to the Closing Date, except as
otherwise expressly provided in Schedule 3.18.

          Section 3.19. Solvency. Upon the making of the initial Loan or the
issuance of the initial Letter of Credit hereunder, each of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be Solvent. "Solvent" means, with respect to any
Person, that (a) the sum of the assets of such Person, both at a fair valuation
and at present fair saleable value, will exceed the liabilities of such Person,
(b) such Person will have sufficient capital with which to conduct its business
as presently conducted and as proposed to be conducted and (c) such Person has
not incurred debts, and does not intend to incur debts, beyond its ability to
pay such debts as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing definition, "debts"
means any liabilities on claims, and "claim" means (i) a right to payment,
whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured or (ii) a right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to
an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured. With respect to any
contingent liabilities, such liabilities shall be computed at the amount which,
in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time, represents the
amount which can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability.

          Section 3.20. Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.20 and except for agreements and arrangements among the Borrower and
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries or among Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiaries, neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to,
and none of the properties and assets of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries
is subject to or bound by, any agreement or arrangement with, and neither the
Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries is engaged in any transaction with, (a) any
Affiliate of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or (b) any Affiliate of
Petro or the General Partner.

          Section 3.21. Ownership. The only general partner of the Borrower is
the General Partner. The General Partner owns approximately 0.01% general
partnership interest in the Borrower. The only limited partner of the Borrower
is the Public Partnership. The Public Partnership owns a 99.99% limited partner
interest in the Borrower. The only general partner of the Public Partnership is

with Permitted Insurers policies of fire and casualty, liability, business
interruption and other forms of insurance in such amounts, with such deductibles
and against such risks and losses as are reasonable for the business and assets
of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. All such policies are in full force and
effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid (other than
retroactive or retrospective premium adjustments that are not yet, but may be,
required to be paid with respect to any period ending prior to the Closing Date
under comprehensive general liability and workmen's compensation insurance
policies), and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with
respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on substantially similar
terms prior to the date of such cancellation. The activities and operations of
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have been conducted in a manner so as to
conform in all material respects to all applicable provisions of such insurance
policies.

party or by which the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is bound or which is

     related sales, leases or dispositions) of Collateral involving aggregate
     net proceeds of $5,000,000 or more, the Borrower shall have prepared and

     Period), the Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such Reference Period
     equals no greater than 4.50 to 1.00.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and any Restricted Subsidiary may

Loans and (5) no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be

<PAGE>

                                                                             105

of the liens created by the Collateral Documents.

          Section 6.08. Partnership or Corporate Existence etc.; Business. (a)
(i) The Borrower will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect
its partnership existence and its status as a partnership not taxable as a
corporation for Federal income tax purposes; (ii) the Borrower will cause each
Restricted Subsidiary to keep in full force and effect its partnership or
corporate existence; and (iii) the Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect all of
its material rights and franchises (in each case except as otherwise
specifically permitted in Section 6.06 and Section 6.07 and except that the
partnership or corporate existence of any Restricted Subsidiary, and any right
or franchise of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, may be terminated if,
in the good faith judgment of the General Partner, such termination is in the
best interest of the Borrower, is not disadvantageous to the Lenders in any
material respect and would not have a Material Adverse Effect).

          (b) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, engage in any material line of business substantially different
than the wholesale and retail sale, distribution, and storage of propane gas and
related petroleum derivative products (other than heating oil, diesel fuel and
gasoline) and the provision of services to customers, and the related retail
sale of supplies and equipment, including home appliances, in each case, as
conducted on the Closing Date.

          (c) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates
to, take any action or refuse to take any reasonable action the effect of which,
if taken or not taken, as the case may be, would be to cause the Public
Partnership or the Borrower to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity other than a partnership for
Federal income tax purposes.

          Section 6.09. Payment of Taxes and Claims. The Borrower will, and will
cause each Subsidiary to, pay all taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges or levies imposed upon it or any of its properties or assets or in
respect of any of its franchises, business, income or profits when the same
become due and payable, but in any event before any penalty or interest accrues
thereon, and all claims (including claims for labor, services, materials and
supplies) for sums which have become due and payable and which by law have or
might become a Lien upon any of its properties or assets, and promptly reimburse
the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders for any such taxes, assessments,
charges or claims paid by them; provided that no such tax, assessment, charge or
claim need be paid or reimbursed if being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings promptly initiated and diligently conducted and if such reserves or
other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required by GAAP shall have
been made therefor and be adequate in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner.

not permit any Subsidiary or Related Person of the Borrower to:

          (a) (i) engage in any transaction in connection with which the

<PAGE>

Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, (ii)
terminate (within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA) or withdraw from any Plan in
any manner, or take, or fail to take, any other action with respect to any Plan
(including a substantial cessation of operations within the meaning of Section
4062(e) of ERISA), (iii) establish, maintain, contribute to or become obligated
to contribute to any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
or other welfare benefit arrangement which provides post-employment benefits,
which cannot be unilaterally terminated by the Borrower, (iv) fail to make full
payment when due of all amounts which, under the provisions of any Plan or
applicable law, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Related Person of the Borrower
is required to pay as contributions thereto, result in the imposition of a Lien
or permit to exist any material accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not
waived, with respect to any Plan or (v) engage in any transaction in connection
with which the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Related Person of the Borrower
could be subject to liability pursuant to Section 4069(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA,
if, as a result of any such event, condition or transaction described in clauses
(i) through (v) above, either individually or together with any other such event
or condition, could result in (x) the imposition of a Lien on any assets or
property of the Borrower or any Related Person or (y) any liability to the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Related Person of the Borrower, which liability
could have a Material Adverse Effect; or

          (b) as of any date of determination (i) permit the amount of unfunded
benefit liabilities under any Plan to exceed the current value of the assets of
any such Plan by more than $250,000 or (ii) permit the aggregate liability
incurred by the Borrower and any Subsidiary and Related Persons of the Borrower
pursuant to Title IV of ERISA with respect to one or more terminations of, or
one or more complete or partial withdrawals from, any Plan to exceed $250,000.

As used in this Section 6.10, the term "accumulated funding deficiency" has the
meaning specified in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, the term
"current value" has the meaning specified in Section 3 of ERISA and the terms
"benefit liabilities" and "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" have the
meanings specified in Section 4001 of ERISA.

          Section 6.11. Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. (a) The Borrower
will maintain or cause to be maintained in working order and condition, in
accordance with normal industry standards, all material properties used or
useful in the business of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries and from
time to time will make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and
replacements thereof.

          (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, keep its insurable properties adequately insured at all times
by Permitted Insurers; maintain such other insurance, to such extent and against
such risks, including fire and other risks insured against by extended coverage,
as is customary with companies in the same or similar businesses, including
public liability insurance against claims for personal injury or death or
property damage occurring upon, in, about or in connection with the use of any
properties owned, occupied or controlled by it; maintain such other insurance as
may be required by law or any Collateral Document; and cause each such insurance
policy to name the Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, as an additional
insured or loss payee thereunder. The Borrower will permit the Agents and an
insurance consultant retained by the Agents, at the expense of the Borrower, to

                                                                             107

consultant.

          Section 6.12. Operative Agreements; Collateral Documents. The Borrower
will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, perform and comply with all
of its obligations under each of the Operative Agreements to which it is a
party, will enforce each such Operative Agreement against each other party
thereto and will not accept the termination of any such Operative Agreement,
unless the taking of or omitting to take any such action would not have a
Material Adverse Effect and would not be disadvantageous in any material respect
to the Lenders. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any other Loan Party
to, amend, modify or supplement any Operative Agreement or its partnership
agreement, certificate of incorporation or by-laws without the prior written
consent of the Required Lenders; provided that (i) the MLP Agreement and the
Partnership Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior
written consent of the Required Lenders if such amendment, modification or
supplement would not have a Material Adverse Effect and the Borrower shall have
delivered to each Lender a copy of such proposed amendment, modification or
supplement together with an Officer's Certificate describing such proposed
amendment, modification or supplement and confirming that such proposed
amendment, modification or supplement would not have a Material Adverse Effect
and (ii) the Note Agreements may be amended, modified or supplemented without
the prior written consent of the Required Lenders if such amendment,
modification or supplement may be made without the written consent of any
Lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower will not, and will not
cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any Material
Contract, or any amendment, modification or waiver in respect of any term or
condition of any Material Contract, other than any such contract or any such
amendments, modifications and waivers in respect thereof which could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 6.13. Chief Executive Office. The Borrower will not move its
chief executive office and the office at which it maintains its records relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents
or change its state of incorporation unless (a) not less than 45 days' prior
written notice of its intention to do so, clearly describing the new location or
state, shall have been given to the Trustee and each Lender and (b) such action,
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and each Lender, to maintain any security
interest in the property subject to the Collateral Documents at all times fully
perfected and in full force and effect shall have been taken.

          Section 6.14. Covenant to Secure Notes Equally. The Borrower covenants
that, if it or any Restricted Subsidiary shall create or assume any Lien upon
any of its property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other
than Liens permitted by the provisions of Section 6.02 (unless prior written
consent to the creation or assumption thereof shall have been obtained from the
Required Lenders), it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby
the Facilities Obligations will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with
any and all other Indebtedness thereby secured so long as any such other
Indebtedness shall be so secured; provided, however, that the provision of such
equal and ratable security shall not constitute a cure or waiver of any related
Event of Default.

United States of America, foreign countries, states, provinces and
municipalities, and of or by any Governmental Authority, including any court,
arbitrator or grand jury, in respect of the conduct of their respective
businesses and the ownership of their respective properties or business, except
such as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly
initiated and diligently conducted and if such reserve or other appropriate
provision, if any, as shall be required by GAAP shall have been made therefor or
the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to,
comply with all Environmental Laws, other than noncompliance which could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, individually or
in the aggregate with any other liability under any Environmental Laws.

          (c) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to,
promptly give notice to the Administrative Agent upon becoming aware of (i) any
violation of or notice of potential liability under any Environmental Law or

under or from any real property of any facility or equipment thereat in excess
of reportable or allowable standards or levels under any Environmental Law, or
in a manner and/or amount which could reasonably be expected to result in
liability under any Environmental Law, which liability would result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to,
promptly provide the Administrative Agent with copies of any notice, submission
or documentation provided by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to the
Governmental Authority or third party under any Environmental Law if the matter
which is the subject of the notice, submission or other documentation could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Such notice,
submission or documentation shall be provided to the Administrative Agent
promptly and, in any event, within 30 days after such material is provided to
the Governmental Authority or third party.

          Section 6.16. Further Assurances. (a) At any time and from time to
time promptly, the Borrower shall, at its expense, execute and deliver to each
Lender and to the Trustee such further instruments and documents, and take such
further action, as may be required under applicable law or as the Lenders may

and purpose of this Agreement and to establish and protect the rights, interests
and remedies created, or intended to be created, in favor of the Lenders.

          (b) Without limitation of Section 6.16(a), the Borrower will, and will
cause the Subsidiaries to, perform any and all acts and execute any and all
documents (including the execution, amendment, supplementation, delivery and
recordation and filing of security agreements and financing statements and
continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable
jurisdiction) for filing under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and
the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other statute, rule or regulation

          Section 6.20. Certain Real Property. Without affecting the obligations
of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under any of the
Collateral Documents, in the event that the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary, at any time after the date hereof, whether directly or indirectly,
acquires any interest in any real property, including any fee or other ownership
interest in one or more properties with an aggregate cost in excess of $50,000,
or any interest under one or more leases of real property for a term in excess
of three years and involving aggregate average payments in excess of $100,000
per annum (each such interest, an "After Acquired Property"), the Borrower will,
or will cause such Restricted Subsidiary to, as soon as practical provide
written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, setting forth with
specificity a description of such After Acquired Property, the location of such
After Acquired Property, any structures or improvements thereon and an appraisal
or its good-faith estimate of the current value of such real property ("Current
Value"). The Administrative Agent shall provide notice to the Borrower of
whether the Required Lenders intend to cause the Borrower to grant and record a
Mortgage on such After Acquired Property; provided that no new mortgage on such
After Acquired Property shall be required if the costs that would be incurred as
a result thereof are excessive in relation to the benefits conferred thereby in
the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders;
provided, further, that the amount secured by a new mortgage on After Acquired
Property located in the State of New York or the State of Florida shall not
exceed 125% of the purchase price of such After Acquired Property. In such
event, the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent a Mortgage, together with such of the documents or
instruments referred to in Section 4.01(g) and Section 4.01(h) as the Agents
shall require. If, at any time, the aggregate cost to the Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries of each interest in real property (x) acquired by the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether directly or indirectly, at any
time after the Closing Date, at a cost equal to or less than $50,000, (y) at
such time, owned directly or indirectly by the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary and (z) for which a mortgage in favor of the Trustee is not in effect
(the "Aggregate Cost of Unmortgaged Property"), exceeds $500,000, the Borrower
will as soon as practical, and in any event within ten Business Days, provide
written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, setting forth with
specificity a description of each such interest in real property, the location
of such real property and an appraisal or its good-faith estimate of the current
value of each such real property. The Administrative Agent may require the
Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to grant and record a mortgage
in favor of the Trustee on one or more of such real properties so that the
Aggregate Cost of Unmortgaged Property does not exceed $500,000, provided that
no new mortgage on any such real property shall be required if the costs that
would be incurred as a result thereof are excessive in relation to the benefit
that would be conferred thereby. In the event a mortgage is required, the
Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee
a mortgage, together with such documents or instruments as the Administrative
Agent shall require. In no event shall the title insurance policy for any such
After Acquired Property be in an amount which is less than the Current Value of
such After Acquired Property. Further, with regard to any interest in real
property, including any fee or other ownership interest in real property or any
material lease of real property, currently owned or held by the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary and which is not being encumbered by a Mortgage of even
date herewith (each such interest, an "Existing Unmortgaged Property"), upon the
written request of the Required Lenders, the Borrower will, or will cause any
applicable Restricted Subsidiary to, execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent a Mortgage, together with such of the documents or

                                                                             112

instruments referred to in Section 4.01(g) and Section 4.01(h) as the Agents
shall require. In no event shall the title insurance policy for any such
Existing Unmortgaged Property be in an amount which is less than the Current
Value of such Existing Unmortgaged Property. The Borrower shall pay all fees and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and expenses of any
customary environmental due diligence, and all title insurance charges and
premiums, in connection with the obligations of the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries under this Section 6.20.

          Section 6.21. Sale and Lease-Back Transactions. The Borrower will not,
and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into
any arrangement, directly or indirectly, with any Person whereby it shall sell
or transfer any property, real or personal, used or useful in its business,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, with an intent to rent or lease such
property or other property which it intends to use for substantially the same
purpose or purposes as the property being sold or transferred.

          Section 6.22. Acquisitions. The Borrower will not, and will not cause
or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, purchase, lease or otherwise
acquire (in one transaction or a series of transactions) all or any substantial
part of the assets of any other Person, except that (a) the Borrower and any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries may purchase inventory in the ordinary course of
business and (b) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary may engage in any
such acquisition if no Event of Default or Default has occurred and is
continuing at the time of any such acquisition or would occur immediately after
giving effect thereto (on a pro forma basis as if such acquisition had occurred
on the first day of the applicable Reference Period for purposes of Section
6.29).

          Section 6.23. Impairment of Security Interests. The Borrower will not,
and will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, take or omit to take any action,
which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing
the security interests in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties
with respect to the Collateral, and the Borrower will not, and will not permit
any of the Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person (other than the Trustee on
behalf of the Secured Parties) any interest whatsoever in the Collateral.

          Section 6.24. Limitation on Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends, etc.
The Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make any other
distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock, or pay any indebtedness
owed to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, (b) make loans or advances to
the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its properties
or assets to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, except for such
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) customary
non-assignment provisions in any lease governing a leasehold interest or other
contract entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices or (ii) this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Note
Agreements.

          Section 6.25. No Other Negative Pledges. The Borrower will not, and
will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, enter into any agreement prohibiting the creation or assumption of
any Lien upon the properties or assets of the

Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether now owned or hereafter acquired,
or requiring an obligation to be secured if some other obligation is secured,
except for this Agreement and the Parity Debt Credit Agreement and the Note
Agreements.

          Section 6.26. Sales of Receivables. The Borrower will not, and will
not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, sell with recourse,
discount or otherwise sell or dispose of its notes or accounts receivable,
except for accounts receivable consisting of assets of an operating unit sold as
a going concern in accordance with all other provisions of this Agreement.

          Section 6.27. Fixed Price Supply Contracts; Certain Policies. (a) The
Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, at
any time be a party or subject to any contract for the purchase or supply by
such parties of propane or other product except where (i) the purchase price is
set with reference to a spot index or indices substantially contemporaneously
with the delivery of such product or (ii) delivery of such propane or other
product is to be made no more than one year after the purchase price is agreed
to.

          (b) The Borrower will not amend, modify or waive the trading policy or
supply inventory position policy referred to in Section 3.29, except that the
Borrower may enter into Commodity Hedging Agreements as permitted under the
other provisions hereof. The Borrower will provide the Agents and the Lenders
with prompt written notice of any such new Commodity Hedging Agreement. Subject
to the foregoing exception, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
comply in all material respects with such policies at all times.

          Section 6.28. Certain Operations. The Borrower shall not permit Petro
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) to acquire a business which derives any revenues from the sale of
propane if, after giving effect to such acquisition, Petro's Pro Forma Propane
Volumes would equal or exceed the lesser of (a) 15% of the Borrower's reported
propane volumes sold for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters which
ended at least 90 days prior to the date of such acquisition and (b) 15 million
gallons of propane (such lesser amount, the "maximum permitted amount"). If as a
result of an acquisition, Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes exceeds the maximum
permitted amount, the Borrower shall not be in violation of this Section 6.28 if
within the period of 90 days following such acquisition the Borrower causes
Petro to complete the disposition of sufficient propane volume to reduce Petro's
Pro Forma Propane Volumes below the maximum permitted amount. For purposes of
this Section 6.28, "Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes" shall mean the actual
propane volumes sold by Petro and any of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower
and the Restricted Subsidiaries) for the most recently completed four fiscal
quarters which ended at least 90 days prior to the date of determination plus
the propane volumes sold of the propane business to be acquired for the most
recently completed four fiscal quarters which ended at least 90 days prior to
the date of determination. In addition, in the event Petro or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) owns a
propane business, the Borrower shall not permit Petro or any such Affiliate to
accept as a customer (except for de minimis, unintentional and isolated
acceptances) any Person who is (or was during the last billing cycle of the
Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) a customer of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries.

          Section 6.29. Funded Debt to Cash Flow. (a) The Borrower will not
permit the ratio on the last day of the Reference Period (the "date of
determination") of (i) Total Funded Debt as of such date of determination to
(ii) Consolidated Cash Flow for such Reference Period to be greater than 4.50 to
1.00.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be required
to comply with the foregoing covenant on any date of determination when (after
giving effect to any borrowings, repayments or other credit events on such day)
there are no outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans or Tranche B Term Loans and
there is no outstanding Tranche B Letter of Credit Exposure. Furthermore, for
purposes of (i) this Section 6.29 only, but not (except as otherwise expressly
provided in clause (ii) below) for purposes of determining the Applicable Margin
or any other purpose and (ii) calculating the Leverage Ratio as required by
Section 4.03(a), Consolidated Cash Flow for the Reference Period shall mean the
greater of (A) Consolidated Cash Flow for the most recent period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters prior to the date of determination and (B) 50% of
Consolidated Cash Flow for the most recent period of eight consecutive fiscal
quarters prior to the date of determination. In addition, it is understood and
agreed that, when and to the extent that another provision of this Agreement
expressly provides otherwise, the Borrower shall not be required to calculate
Consolidated Cash Flow on a pro forma basis as of any date of determination
other than the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower.

          Section 6.30. Independent Corporate Existence. (a) Except as set forth
on Schedule 6.30, (a) the Borrower shall maintain, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) to maintain, books,
records and accounts that are separate from the books, records and accounts of
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries such that: (i) the revenues of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries will be credited to the accounts of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries only; (ii) all expenses incurred by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall be paid only from the accounts of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (other than those paid by Petro and allocated to the Borrower in
the manner set forth in clause (c) of this Section); (iii) only officers and
employees of the General Partner, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in their
capacity as such shall have the authority to make disbursements with respect to

sharing of accounts or funds between the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Petro or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand; and (v) all cash and funds of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries shall be managed separately from the cash and funds of Petro or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), and

compensated directly from the bank accounts of the General Partner, the Borrower
and such Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) for
services provided by such employees, consultants and agents and, to the extent
any employee, consultant or agent is also an employee, consultant or agent of
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries, the compensation of such employee, consultant
or agent shall be allocated in accordance with clause (c) of this Section among
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Petro and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, on a basis which

reasonably reflects the services rendered to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
(other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries).

          (c) All overhead expenses (including telephone and other utility
charges) for items shared by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Petro or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be allocated on the basis of actual use
to the extent practicable and, to the extent such allocation is not practicable,
on a basis reasonably related to actual use.

          (d) The Borrower shall not permit Petro or any of its Subsidiaries to
be named as a loss payee or additional insured on the insurance policy covering
the property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Petro
Holdings or its Subsidiaries), or enter into an agreement with the holder of
such policy whereby in the event of a loss in connection with such property,
proceeds are paid to Petro and its Subsidiaries.

                                                                             119

          (t) the occurrence of any Change in Control; or

          (u) Petro Holdings or any other Unrestricted Subsidiary shall make any
Restricted Payment, loans or other extensions of credit directly to the Public
Partnership;

then, and in every such event, and at any time thereafter during the continuance
of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required
Lenders, shall take one or more of the following actions, at the same or
different times: (i) by notice to the Borrower terminate the Commitments and
they shall immediately terminate; (ii) by notice to the Borrower declare the
Loans then outstanding to be forthwith due and payable (in whole or, in the sole
discretion of the Required Lenders, from time to time in part), whereupon the
principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued
interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the
Borrower accrued hereunder or under any other Loan Document, shall thereupon
become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding; (iii) require the Borrower to deposit cash collateral
with the Trustee pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement in an amount not
exceeding the Letter of Credit Exposure; (iv) exercise any remedies available
under the Guarantee Agreements, the Collateral Documents or otherwise; or (v)
any combination of the foregoing; provided that in the case of any of the Events
of Default with respect to the Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) above,
the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans
then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued
Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrower accrued hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, shall automatically become due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein or in any
other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

          Section 7.02. Remedies. In case any one or more Events of Default or
Defaults shall occur and be continuing, (i) any Lender may proceed to protect
and enforce the rights of such Lender by an action at law, suit in equity or
other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any
agreement contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or for an injunction
against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise, and (ii)
the Trustee and the Lenders may exercise any rights or remedies in their
respective capacities under the Collateral Documents in accordance with the
provisions thereof. In case of a default in the payment or performance of any
provision hereof or of the Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to each Lender
such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the cost and expenses of
collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements,
and any out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any such holder incurred in
connection with analyzing, evaluating, protecting, ascertaining, defending or
enforcing any of its rights as set forth herein or in any of the Loan Documents.
No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any Lender in exercising any
right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice
such Lender's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by
this Agreement or by any other Loan Document upon any Lender shall be exclusive
of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or
hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                           THE AGENTS AND ISSUING BANK

          Section 8.01. Appointment and Authorization. (a) Each of the Lenders,
and each subsequent holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof, hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank to
take such actions as agent on behalf of such Lender or holder and to exercise
such powers as are specifically delegated to such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, by the terms and provisions hereof and of the other Loan
Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither the Agents nor the Issuing Bank shall have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agents or
the Issuing Bank.

          (b) The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the
Lenders to, without hereby limiting any implied authority, and hereby agrees (in
the case of clause (ii) below, at the direction of the Required Lenders) to, (i)
receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on
the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to
distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (ii)
give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of
Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual
knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (iii) distribute
to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials
delivered by the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document as received by the Administrative Agent (other than
materials required hereunder to be delivered by the Borrower directly to the
Lenders).

          Section 8.02. Liability of Agents. Neither the Agents, the Issuing
Bank, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys-in-fact, affiliates or agents, shall be liable as such for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, except for such party's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction), or be responsible for any statement, warranty, recital
or representation herein or the contents of any document delivered in connection
herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the
performance or observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of the terms,
conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan Document. Neither the
Agents nor the Issuing Bank shall be responsible to the Lenders or the holders
of the Notes for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents or other
instruments or agreements. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have
received from the payee of such Note notice, given as provided herein, of the
transfer thereof in compliance with Section 9.04. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be

<PAGE>

                                                                             121

genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this
Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense
that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. Neither the Agents, the Issuing Bank nor any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents, shall have any responsibility to the
Borrower on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any
Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the
failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender or the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of any of their respective obligations hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith. Each of the Agents
and the Issuing Bank may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through
agents or employees, shall be entitled to consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it with respect to
all matters arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts. None of Lenders identified in this Agreement as
a "Documentation Agent" or "Syndication Agent" shall have any obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement in such capacity other
than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing,
none of Lenders so identified as "Documentation Agent" or "Syndication Agent"
shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each
Lender acknowledges that is has not relied, and will not rely, on any of Lenders
so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not
taking action hereunder.

          Section 8.03. Action by Agents. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that
none of the Agents and the Issuing Bank shall be under any duty to take any
discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required
Lenders. The obligations of the Agents and the Issuing Bank under the Loan
Documents are only those expressly set forth herein and therein.

          Section 8.04. Notice of Default. Except for actual knowledge of
non-payment, the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to
the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that
unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions,
the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action,
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

          Section 8.05. Successor Agents. Each Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Bank (except, in the case of the Issuing Bank, in respect of Letters of
Credit issued by it) may

                                                                             122

resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint from among the
Lenders a successor, whereupon such successor shall succeed to the rights,
powers and duties of either the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank, and the
term "Administrative Agent" or "Issuing Bank" shall mean such successor agent
effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative
Agent or Issuing Bank's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent or
Issuing Bank shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on
the part of such former Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or any of the parties
to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 10 days after the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent's or
Issuing Bank's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and
the retiring Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor, which shall be a commercial bank
organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any
State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000
or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the
Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder by a
successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or
Issuing Bank and the retiring Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the resignation of
the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank.

          Section 8.06. Agent and Affiliate. With respect to the Loans made by
it hereunder, the Letters of Credit issued by it hereunder and the Notes issued
to it, each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank in its individual capacity and
not as an Agent or the Issuing Bank shall have the same rights and powers as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent or the
Issuing Bank. The term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its
individual capacity. Each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank (and its
Affiliates) may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of business and transactions with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent or the Issuing Bank (or such
Affiliate thereof).

          Section 8.07. Indemnification. Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse
each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank, on demand, in the amount of its pro
rata share (based on its Commitment hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the
benefit of the Lenders by such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed
by the Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Agents, the
Issuing Bank and any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys-in-fact, affiliates or agents, promptly after demand, in the amount of
such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as an Agent or
the Issuing Bank or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any other Loan

                                                                             123

Document, any documents contemplated by or referred herein or therein, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by it
or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent
the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; provided that no Lender
shall be liable to any Agent or the Issuing Bank for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent or the Issuing Bank (as found by a final and
nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction).

          Section 8.08. Credit Decision. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Agents hereunder, the Agents shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Agents or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

          Section 8.09. Intercreditor Agreement. The Lenders hereby authorize
and agree to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and authorize
the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, to execute the Agreement of
Lenders and Supplement to Intercreditor Agreement.

          Section 9.04. Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the

          Facility A and the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage (as defined
          in the Parity Debt Credit Agreement) of such lender under the Parity
          Debt Credit Agreement shall be the same;

               (C) assignments and participations pursuant to this Section 9.04
          need to be pro rata among the Facilities;

               (D) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
          the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
          processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

               (E) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to
          the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire.

          For the purposes of this Section 9.04, the terms "Approved Fund" has
the following meaning:

          "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
     engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and
     similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and
     that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a
     Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or
     manages a Lender.

          (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
     paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in
     each Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party
     hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
     Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
     Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
     interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
     obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
     Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
     shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, Section
     2.15, Section 2.19 and Section 9.05). Any assignment or transfer by a
     Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
     with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
     sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
     accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                                                                             128

          (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
     the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
     Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
     recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments
     of, and principal amount of the Loans and Letter of Credit Exposure owing
     to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
     "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
     Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may
     treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
     terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
     notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
     inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any
     reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
     executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed
     administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender
     hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b)
     of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
     paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
     Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in
     the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
     Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
     paragraph.

          (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the
Loans owing to it); provided that, (A) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not,
without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or
waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby
pursuant to the proviso to Section 9.08(b) and (2) directly affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13, Section
2.14, Section 2.15 and Section 2.19 to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender, provided such
Participant shall be subject to Section 2.17 as though it were a Lender.

          (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
     payment under Section 2.13, Section 2.14 or Section 2.19 than the
     applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
     participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
     participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written
     consent.

                                                                             129

     Any Participant that is a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to the
     benefits of Section 2.19 unless such Participant complies with Section
     2.19(d).

          (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

          (e) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant
Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate
transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

          (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any
or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender
without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without
regard to the limitations set forth in Section 9.04(b). Each of the Borrower,
each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not
institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting
against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency
or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one
year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial
paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender
designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising
out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender
during such period of forbearance.

          Section 9.05. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated) all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Agent or the Issuing
Bank in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the closing of the Facilities, the
administration of the Facilities or any amendment, modification or waiver of the
provisions hereof or thereof or incurred by any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of the rights of the
Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, the Notes issued
hereunder or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including the reasonable
fees, charges and disbursements of (i) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel
to the Administrative Agent, (ii) any search and filing fees of any company
acceptable to the Lenders, (iii) any third party consultants retained to assist
the Agents in analyzing any environmental, insurance and other due diligence
issues and (iv) in connection with any such enforcement or protection, any other
counsel for any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender.

          (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Agents, the Issuing
Bank, the affiliates of any Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders, and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and Controlling Persons (each,
an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all losses, claims (whether
valid or not), damages and liabilities, joint or several, to which

<PAGE>

                                                                             130

such Indemnified Party may become subject, related to or arising out of (i) the
Facilities and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the
parties hereto or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (iii) the use of the Letters of Credit or the proceeds of the Loans or
(iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto. The Borrower
further agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Party for all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with
the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened
claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Section
9.05(b) shall not apply in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final
and nonappealable judgment that such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted
from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Agents, the Issuing
Bank, the Lenders and the other Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
losses, claims (whether valid or not), damages and liabilities, joint or
several, to which such Indemnified Party may become subject, related to or
arising out of (i) any Environmental Laws affecting the Borrower or any other
Loan Party or its properties or assets, (ii) any Hazardous Materials managed by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party, (iii) any event, condition or circumstance
involving environmental pollution, regulation or control affecting the Borrower
or any other Loan Party or its properties or assets or (iv) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto. The Borrower further
agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Party for all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with
the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened
claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Section
9.05(c) shall not apply in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final
and nonappealable judgment that such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted
from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          (d) In the event that the foregoing indemnity is unavailable or
insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then the Borrower will
contribute to amounts paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in respect of
such Indemnified Party's losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such
proportions as appropriately reflect the relative benefits received by and fault
of the Borrower and such Indemnified Party in connection with the matters as to
which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate and other equitable
considerations.

          (e) If any action, proceeding or investigation is commenced, as to
which any Indemnified Party proposes to demand such indemnification, it shall
notify the Borrower with reasonable promptness; provided, however, that any
failure by such Indemnified Party to notify the Borrower shall not relieve the
Borrower from its obligations hereunder except to the extent the Borrower is
prejudiced thereby. The Borrower shall be entitled to assume the defense of any
such action, proceeding or investigation, including the employment of counsel
and the payment

<PAGE>

                                                                             131

of all fees and expenses. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in connection with any such action, proceeding or investigation
and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless (i) the Borrower has
failed to assume the defense and employ counsel as provided herein, (ii) the
Borrower has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses of separate counsel
or (iii) an action, proceeding or investigation has been commenced against such
Indemnified Party and the Borrower and representation of both the Borrower and
such Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate because of
actual or potential conflicts of interest between the parties (in the case of
any Agent or Lender, the existence of any such actual or potential conflict of
interest to be determined by such party, taking into account, among other
things, any relevant regulatory concerns). In the case of any circumstance
described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence,
the Borrower shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not in any event be
required to pay the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus
appropriate local counsel under the direction of such separate counsel) for all
Indemnified Parties. The Borrower shall be liable only for settlement of any
claim against an Indemnified Party made with the Borrower's written consent.

          (f) The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Agent or Lender. All amounts due under this Section
9.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.

          Section 9.06. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan
Document and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each
Lender under this Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

          Section 9.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          Section 9.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of any
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have. No waiver of

                                                                             132

any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by Section 9.08(b), and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

          (b) None of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any provision
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment or modification shall
(i) decrease the principal amount of any Loan, extend the Tranche A Maturity
Date, the Tranche B Conversion Date or the Tranche B Maturity Date, extend any
Tranche B Repayment Date or any date for the payment of any interest on any
Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or decrease the
rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written consent of each holder
of a Note affected thereby, (ii) increase or extend the Commitment or decrease
the Commitment Fees or Letter of Credit Fees of any Lender without the prior
written consent of such Lender, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
reimbursement of a Letter of Credit Disbursement without the prior written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) permit the release of any material
amount of Collateral under any Collateral Document or permit the release of any
material guarantor from the Guarantee Agreements without the prior written
consent of each Lender, (v) increase the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders
without the prior written consent of each Lender, (vi) waive, amend or modify
Section 6.01 so as to permit any renewal, refunding or refinancing of Facility A
without the prior written consent of each Lender or (vii) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.01(c) or waive the conditions set forth therein, the
provisions of Section 2.11(h), the provisions of Section 2.16, the provisions of
Section 9.04(a)(i), Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B) and Section 9.04(b)(ii)(C) or any of
the provisions of Article II relating to the pro rata treatment between this
Agreement and the Parity Debt Credit Agreement, the provisions of this Section
9.08 or the definition of "Required Lenders" or otherwise change the percentage
of the Commitments, the percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
the Notes or the number of Lenders which shall be required for the Lenders or
any of them to take any action under any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of each Lender; provided
further that (A) if any amendment, modification or waiver of Section 2.11(e),
(f), (g) or (h) would affect the holders of Tranche A Revolving Loans or Tranche
B Loans, as applicable (an "Affected Class"), then such amendment, modification
or waiver shall require the prior written consent of Lenders holding Loans and
participations in Letters of Credit, and having Commitments, representing a
majority of the outstanding principal amount of all Loans of the Affected Class,
the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Affected Class and
the aggregate amount of unused Commitments of the Affected Class and (B) no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of any
Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of such
Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable. Each Lender and each holder of a Note
shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this
Section 9.08 regardless of whether its Note shall have been marked to make
reference thereto, and any consent by any Lender or holder of a Note pursuant to
this Section 9.08 shall bind any Person subsequently acquiring a Note from it,
whether or not such Note shall have been so marked.

                                                                             133

          (c) In the event that any waiver, amendment or modification requires
the prior written consent of each Lender pursuant to Section 9.08(b), and the
Borrower has obtained the approval of all but one Lender, the Borrower shall
have the right to replace such non-consenting Lender; provided that, (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans
and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of
replacement, (iv) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under
Section 2.15 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be
purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto,
(v) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vi) the replaced Lender
shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.04(b) (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
registration and processing fee referred to therein) and (vii) any such
replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced
Lender.

          Section 9.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein or in the Notes to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest
rate, together with all fees and charges which are treated as interest under
applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), as provided for herein or in any
other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for,
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate
of interest payable under the affected Note held by such Lender, together with
all Charges payable to such Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

          Section 9.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the other Operative Agreements and the Letter Agreement constitute
the entire contract among the parties relative to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Any agreement previously entered into among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof is superseded by this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements and the Letter Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements or
the Letter Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party, other than the parties hereto and the other Secured Parties, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements or the Letter Agreement.

          Section 9.11. Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

          Section 9.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which
when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 9.03.

          Section 9.13. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          Section 9.14. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury Trial. (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York, New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring
any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

          (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any
New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York, New York. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

          (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

          (d) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each of the
Borrower, the Lenders, the Agents and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim arising out of or related to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

          Section 9.15. LEGEND. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO THE

(as amended and restated hereby) with only the terms thereof being modified as

(i) each Exiting Lender shall cease to be a party to this Agreement, (ii) no
