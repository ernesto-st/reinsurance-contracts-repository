modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"),

         WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide a
$155,000,000 credit facility for the purposes hereinafter set forth; and

         WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to make the requested credit facility
available to the Borrower on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth;

         NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1.1      DEFINITIONS.

         As used in this Credit Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings specified below unless the context otherwise requires:

                  "30-Day Interbank Offered Rate" means, for any Swingline Loan,
         the rate per annum (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-one
         hundredth (1/100) of one percent) appearing each day on Page 3750 (or
         any successor page) of the Dow Jones Market Service as the London
         interbank offered rate for deposits in Dollars at approximately 11:00
         a.m. (London time) for a term of thirty (30) days. If for any reason
         such rate is not available, the term "30-Day Interbank Offered Rate"
         shall mean the rate per annum (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
         1/100 of 1%) appearing each day on Reuters Screen LIBO Page as the

         11:00 a.m. (London time) for a term of thirty (30) days; provided,
         however, if more than one rate is specified on Reuters Screen LIBO
         Page, the applicable rate shall be the arithmetic mean of all such
         rates (rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100 of 1%). As to any

         Offered Rate" shall mean such rate as determined on the next proceeding
         Business Day when such rate was determinable.

                                CREDIT FACILITIES

         2.1      REVOLVING LOANS.

                  (a)      Revolving Commitment. Subject to the terms and
         conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and
         warranties set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make
         available to the Borrower such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage
         of revolving credit loans requested by the Borrower in Dollars
         ("Revolving Loans") from time to time from the Closing Date until the
         Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Revolving Commitments shall
         have been terminated as provided herein; provided, however, that (i)
         with regard to the Lenders collectively, the amount of the Revolving
         Obligations outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Committed
         Amount; provided, further, (ii) with regard to each Lender
         individually, such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the sum
         of the Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations outstanding plus Swingline
         Loans outstanding shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving Commitment
         Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount. Revolving Loans may
         consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination
         thereof, as the Borrower may request; provided, however, that no more
         than five Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding hereunder at any time
         (it being understood that, for purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with
         different Interest Periods shall be considered as separate Eurodollar
         Loans, even if they begin on the same date, although borrowings,
         extensions and conversions may, in accordance with the provisions
         hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to
         constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period).
         Revolving Loans hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance
         with the provisions hereof.

                  (b)      Revolving Loan Borrowings.

                           (i) Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall request a
                  Revolving Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephonic
                  notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative
                  Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina
                  time) on the Business Day of the requested borrowing in the
                  case of Base Rate Loans, and on the second Business Day prior
                  to the date of the requested borrowing in the case of
                  Eurodollar Loans. Each such request for borrowing shall be
                  irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Revolving Loan is
                  requested, (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which
                  shall be a Business Day), (C) the aggregate principal amount
                  to be borrowed, and (D) whether the borrowing shall be
                  comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Loans or a
                  combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are requested,
                  the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to
                  specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable
                  Interest Period in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, then such
                  notice shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period
                  of one month, or (II) the type of Revolving Loan requested,
                  then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for a Base
                  Rate Loan hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give
                  notice to each affected Lender promptly upon receipt of each
                  Notice of




                                       24

                  Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the contents
                  thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing to be
                  made pursuant thereto.

                           (ii) Minimum Amounts. Each Base Rate Loan that is a
                  Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal
                  amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
                  thereof (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed
                  Amount, if less), and each Eurodollar Loan that is a Revolving
                  Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of
                  $2,500,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
                  thereof (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed
                  Amount, if less).

                           (iii) Advances. Each Lender will make its Revolving
                  Commitment Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing
                  available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
                  Borrower as specified in Section 3.15(a), or in such other
                  manner as the Administrative Agent may specify in writing, by
                  1:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date
                  specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and
                  in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent.
                  Such borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by
                  the Administrative Agent by crediting the account of the
                  Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of the
                  amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the
                  Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative
                  Agent.

                  (c)      Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving
         Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless
         accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

                  (d)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,

                           (i) Base Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving
                  Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate
                  Loans, such Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum
                  rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate.

                           (ii) Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as
                  Revolving Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of
                  Eurodollar Loans, such Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at
                  a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

         Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each
         applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be
         specified herein).

                  (e)      Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans made by each
         Lender shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the
         Borrower to such Lender in an original principal amount equal to such
         Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed
         Amount and in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.1(e).

         2.2      LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

                  (a)      The Letter of Credit Commitment.

                           (i)      Subject to the terms and conditions set
                  forth herein, (A) the Issuing Lender agrees, in reliance upon
                  the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section
                  2.2, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the
                  period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit
                  Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of
                  the Borrower, and to amend Letters of Credit previously issued
                  by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to
                  honor drafts under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders
                  severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for
                  the account of the Borrower; provided that the Issuing Lender
                  shall not be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with
                  respect to any Letter of Credit, and no Lender shall be
                  obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the
                  date of such L/C Credit Extension, (x) the sum of the
                  Revolving Loans outstanding plus LOC Obligations outstanding
                  plus Swingline Loans outstanding would exceed the Revolving
                  Committed Amount, (y) with regard to any Lender individually,
                  such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the sum of
                  the Revolving Loans outstanding plus LOC Obligations
                  outstanding plus Swingline Loans outstanding would exceed such
                  Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving
                  Committed Amount or (z) the amount of LOC Obligations
                  outstanding would exceed the LOC Committed Amount. Within the
                  foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions
                  hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit
                  shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may,
                  during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to
                  replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been
                  drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit
                  shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from
                  and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by
                  the terms and conditions hereof.

                           (ii)     The Issuing Lender shall be under no
                  obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:

                                    (A) any order, judgment or decree of any
                           Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its
                           terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing
                           Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law
                           applicable to the Issuing Lender or any request or
                           directive (whether or not having the force of law)
                           from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
                           over the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request
                           that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of
                           letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit
                           in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender
                           with respect to such Letter of Credit any
                           restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
                           which the Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated
                           hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or
                           shall impose upon the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed
                           loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the

                           Closing Date and which the Issuing Lender in good
                           faith deems material to it;

                                    (B) subject to Section 2.2(b)(iii), the
                           expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
                           occur more than twelve months after the date of
                           issuance, unless the Required Lenders have approved
                           such expiry date;

                                    (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter
                           of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit
                           Expiration Date, unless all the Lenders have approved
                           such expiry date; or

                                    (D) such Letter of Credit is to be used for
                           a purpose other than is permitted by Section 7.9 or
                           denominated in a currency other than Dollars.

                           (iii)    The Issuing Lender shall be under no
                  obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the Issuing
                  Lender would have no obligation at such time to issue such
                  Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof,
                  or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not
                  accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

                  (b)      Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of
         Credit.

                           (i)      Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or
                  amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower

                  Lender may agree in a particular instance in its sole
                  discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of
                  amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an
                  initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
                  Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
                  the Issuing Lender: (A) the proposed issuance date of the

                  presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
                  thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the Issuing Lender
                  may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any
                  outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
                  Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
                  the Issuing Lender (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B)
                  the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a
                  Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and
                  (D) such other matters as the Issuing Lender may require.

                           (ii)     Promptly after receipt of any Letter of
                  Credit Application, the Issuing Lender will confirm with the
                  Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
                  Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of

                  Lender will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
                  thereof. Upon receipt by the Issuing Lender of confirmation
                  from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or
                  amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof,
                  then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing
                  Lender shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
                  for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable
                  amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with
                  the Issuing Lender's usual and customary business practices.
                  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
                  Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
                  unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Lender a
                  risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal
                  to its pro rata share of the obligations under such Letter of
                  Credit (based on the Revolving Commitment Percentage of such
                  Lender).

                           (iii)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of
                  Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising
                  bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the
                  Issuing Lender will also deliver to the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter
                  of Credit or amendment.

                  (c)      Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of
         Participations.

                           (i)      Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any
                  Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter
                  of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall notify the Borrower and
                  the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on
                  the date of any payment by the Issuing Lender under a Letter
                  of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the Borrower
                  shall reimburse the Issuing Lender through the Administrative
                  Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the
                  Borrower fails to so reimburse the Issuing Lender by such
                  time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
                  Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed
                  drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such
                  Lender's pro rata share thereof (based on the respective
                  Revolving Commitment Percentage of such Lender). In such
                  event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a
                  Revolving Loan advance comprised of Base Rate Loans to be
                  disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the
                  Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
                  multiples specified in Section 2.1 for the principal amount of
                  Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized
                  portion of the Revolving Committed Amount and the conditions
                  set forth in Section 5.2 (other than the delivery of a Notice
                  of Borrowing). Any notice given by the Issuing Lender or the
                  Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(i) may be
                  given by telephone if immediately

                  confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an
                  immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or
                  binding effect of such notice.

                           (ii)     Each Lender (including the Lender acting as
                  Issuing Lender) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section
                  2.2(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for
                  the account of the Issuing Lender at the Administrative
                  Agent's Office in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the
                  Unreimbursed Amount (based on the respective Revolving
                  Commitment Percentage of such Lender) not later than 1:00 p.m.
                  on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
                  Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
                  Section 2.2(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available
                  shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower
                  in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds
                  so received to the Issuing Lender.

                           (iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that
                  is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Loan advance because
                  the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or
                  for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
                  incurred from the Issuing Lender an L/C Borrowing in the
                  amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced,
                  which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
                  (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the
                  Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender
                  pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in
                  respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
                  constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of
                  its participation obligation under this Section 2.2.

                           (iv)     Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan
                  or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) to reimburse
                  the Issuing Lender for any amount drawn under any Letter of
                  Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's pro rata share
                  (based on the respective Revolving Commitment Percentage of
                  such Lender) of such amount shall be solely for the account of
                  the Issuing Lender.

                           (v)      Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving
                  Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the Issuing Lender for
                  amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this
                  Section 2.2(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
                  not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any
                  set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
                  which such Lender may have against the Issuing Lender, the
                  Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B)
                  the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other
                  occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any
                  of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's
                  obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section
                  2.2(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2
                  (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Notice of
                  Borrowing). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
                  otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
                  the Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made

                  by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together
                  with interest as provided herein.

                           (vi)     If any Lender fails to make available to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender any
                  amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the
                  foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(c) by the time
                  specified in Section 2.2(c)(ii), the Issuing Lender shall be
                  entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
                  Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
                  thereon for the period from the date such payment is required
                  to the date on which such payment is immediately available to
                  the Issuing Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
                  Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the
                  Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender (through the
                  Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under
                  this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d)      Repayment of Participations.

                           (i)      At any time after the Issuing Lender has
                  made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received
                  from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such
                  payment in accordance with Section 2.2(c), if the
                  Administrative Agent receives for the account of the Issuing
                  Lender any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed
                  Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower
                  or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied
                  thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent
                  will distribute to such Lender its pro rata share thereof
                  (based on the respective Revolving Commitment Percentage of
                  such Lender) (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
                  payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
                  Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as
                  those received by the Administrative Agent.

                           (ii)     If any payment received by the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender
                  pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i) is required to be returned under
                  any of the circumstances described in Section 3.14 (including
                  pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Lender
                  in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender its
                  pro rata share thereof (based on the respective Revolving
                  Commitment Percentage of such Lender) on demand of the
                  Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
                  such demand to the date such amount is returned by such
                  Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
                  from time to time in effect.

                  (e)      Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower
         to reimburse the Issuing Lender for each drawing under each Letter of
         Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional
         and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
         terms of this Credit Agreement under all circumstances, including the
         following:



                                       30
<PAGE>

                           (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of
                  such Letter of Credit, this Credit Agreement, or any other
                  agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                           (ii)     the existence of any claim, counterclaim,
                  set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at
                  any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such
                  Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary
                  or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Lender or
                  any other Person, whether in connection with this Credit
                  Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
                  Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating
                  thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                           (iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other
                  document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be
                  forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
                  any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
                  respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
                  of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
                  Letter of Credit;

                           (iv)      any payment by the Issuing Lender under
                  such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
                  certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of
                  such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing
                  Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to
                  be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for
                  the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
                  representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any
                  transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in
                  connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                           (v)      any other circumstance or happening
                  whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
                  including any other circumstance that might otherwise
                  constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
                  Borrower.

                  The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of
         Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the
         event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or
         other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the Issuing
         Lender. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any
         such claim against the Issuing Lender and its correspondents unless
         such notice is given as aforesaid.

                  (f)      Role of Issuing Lender. Each Lender and the Borrower
         agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing
         Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other
         than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by
         the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or
         accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing
         or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Lender, any
         Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
         participants or assignees of the Issuing Lender shall be liable to any
         Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at




                                       31
<PAGE>

         the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required
         Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence
         of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,
         effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument
         related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The
         Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
         beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of
         Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and
         shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as
         it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any
         other agreement. None of the Issuing Lender, any Agent-Related Person,
         nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of
         the Issuing Lender, shall be liable or responsible for any of the
         matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.2(e);
         provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary
         notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the Issuing
         Lender, and the Issuing Lender may be liable to the Borrower, to the
         extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
         consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the
         Borrower proves were caused by the Issuing Lender's willful misconduct
         or gross negligence or the Issuing Lender's willful failure to pay
         under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
         beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with
         the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not
         in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Lender may accept documents
         that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
         further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the
         contrary, and the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for the
         validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
         purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or
         benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may
         prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

                  (g)      Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the
         Administrative Agent, (i) if the Issuing Lender has honored any full or
         partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has
         resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit
         Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason remain
         outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall
         immediately Cash Collateralize the LOC Obligations outstanding (in an
         amount equal to the amount of LOC Obligations outstanding determined as
         of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of Credit Expiration
         Date, as the case may be). For purposes hereof, "Cash Collateralize"
         means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative
         Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders, as
         collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances
         pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender (which documents are hereby
         consented to by the Lenders). The Borrower hereby grants to the
         Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lender and the
         Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all
         balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral
         shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts
         at Bank of America.

                  (h)      Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise
         expressly agreed by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter
         of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an
         Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the "International

         Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of International
         Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in
         effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of
         Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
         Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International
         Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance (including the
         ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking Technique and
         Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single currency
         (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

                  (i)      Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the
         event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any

                  (a)      Swingline Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
         set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents and in reliance upon
         the representations and warranties set forth herein, the Swingline
         Lender hereby agrees to make loans to the Borrower in Dollars at any
         time and from time to time from the Closing Date to but not including
         the Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Revolving Commitments
         shall have been terminated as provided herein (each such loan, a
         "Swingline Loan" and collectively, the "Swingline Loans"); provided
         that (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans
         outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Swingline Committed
         Amount and (ii) with regard to the Lenders collectively, the amount of
         Revolving Obligations outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving
         Committed Amount. Prior to the Maturity Date, Swingline Loans may be
         repaid and reborrowed by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions
         hereof.

                  (b)      Method of Borrowing and Funding Swingline Loans. By
         no later than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), on the date
         of the requested borrowing of Swingline Loans, the Borrower shall
         telephone the Swingline Lender as well as submit a Swingline Loan
         Request to the Swingline Lender in the form of Exhibit 2.3(b) setting
         forth (i) the amount of the requested Swingline Loan and (ii) the date
         of the requested Swingline Loan and complying in all respects with
         Section 5.2. The Swingline Lender shall initiate the transfer of funds
         representing the Swingline Loan advance to the Borrower by 3:00 p.m. on
         the Business Day of the requested borrowing. Each Swingline Loan shall
         be in a minimum amount of $100,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000
         in excess thereof.

                  (c)      Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans. The
         Borrower agrees to repay all Swingline Loans within five Business Days
         of demand therefor by the Swingline Lender. Each repayment of a
         Swingline Loan may be accomplished by requesting Revolving Loans which
         request is not subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2. In
         the event that the Borrower shall fail to timely repay any Swingline
         Loan, and in any event upon (i) a request by the Swingline Lender, (ii)
         the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(f) or
         (iii) the acceleration of any Loan or termination of any Commitment
         pursuant to Section 9.2, each other Lender shall irrevocably and
         unconditionally purchase from the Swingline Lender, without recourse or
         warranty, an



                                       33
<PAGE>

         undivided interest and participation in such Swingline Loan in an
         amount equal to such other Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage
         thereof, by directly purchasing a participation in such Swingline Loan
         in such amount (regardless of whether the conditions precedent thereto
         set forth in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, whether or not the
         Borrower has submitted a Notice of Borrowing and whether or not the
         Commitments are then in effect, any Event of Default exists or all the
         Loans have been accelerated) and paying the proceeds thereof to the
         Swingline Lender at the address provided in Section 11.1, or at such
         other address as the Swingline Lender may designate, in Dollars and in
         immediately available funds. If such amount is not in fact made
         available to the Swingline Lender by any Lender, the Swingline Lender
         shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender,
         together with accrued interest thereon for each day from the date of
         demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender does not pay
         such amount forthwith upon the Swingline Lender's demand therefor, and
         until such time as such Lender makes the required payment, the
         Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding
         Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation
         for all purposes of the Credit Documents other than those provisions
         requiring the other Lenders to purchase a participation therein.
         Further, such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all
         payments made of principal and interest on its Loans, and any other
         amounts due to it hereunder to the Swingline Lender to fund Swingline
         Loans in the amount of the participation in Swingline Loans that such
         Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) until such
         amount has been purchased (as a result of such assignment or
         otherwise). The principal amount of all Swingline Loans shall be due
         and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless accelerated sooner
         pursuant to Section 9.2 or required to be repaid by the Swingline
         Lender pursuant to the foregoing terms of this Section 2.3(c).

                  (d)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,
         each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to
         the 30-Day Interbank Offered Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

                  (e)      Swingline Note. The Swingline Loans made by the
         Swingline Lender shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note
         of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in the face amount of the
         Swingline Committed Amount and in substantially the form of Exhibit
         2.3(e).

         2.4      EXTENSION OPTION.

                  (a)      First Extension Option. The Borrower may, by notice
         to the Lenders, given not more than 90 days and not less than 45 days
         prior to March 1, 2004 (the "First Extension Date") request that the
         Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional 364 days from the
         existing Maturity Date. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Borrower
         and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 30th day prior to
         the First Extension Date, advise the Borrower whether or not it agrees
         to extend the Maturity Date for an additional 364 days. Each decision
         by a Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender, and any
         Lender that has not so advised the Administrative Agent by the 30th day
         prior to the First Extension Date shall be deemed to have declined to
         agree to such extension.



                                       34
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Second Extension Option. The Borrower may, by notice
         to the Lenders, given not more than 90 days and not less than 45 days
         prior to March 1, 2005 (the "Second Extension") request that the
         Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional 364 days from the
         existing Maturity Date. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Borrower
         and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 30th day prior to
         the Second Extension Date, advise the Borrower whether or not it agrees
         to extend the Maturity Date for an additional 364 days. Each decision
         by a Lender shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender, and any
         Lender that has not so advised the Administrative Agent by the 30th day
         prior to the Second Extension Date shall be deemed to have declined to
         agree to such extension.

                  (c)      Non-Extending Lenders. If, in response to a request
         for an extension of the Maturity Date, one or more Lenders shall fail
         to agree to the requested extension (each a "Non-Extending Lender"),
         then the Borrower may elect to either (i) continue the credit facility
         hereunder at the same level of Commitments by replacing each of the Non
         Extending Lenders with Replacement Lenders (as defined below) pursuant
         to the terms of Section 2.4(d) or (ii) provided that the requested
         extension is approved by Lenders holding more than 50% of the
         Commitments hereunder (including for purposes hereof any Replacement
         Lender which may replace a Non-Extending Lender, (the "Approving
         Lenders"), extend and continue the credit facility at a lower aggregate
         amount equal to the Commitments held by the Approving Lenders. In any
         such case, (x) the Maturity Date relating to the Commitments held by
         the Non-Extending Lenders shall remain as in effect with repayment of
         the obligations held by such Non-Extending Lenders being due on such
         date and termination of their respective Commitments on such date and
         (y) the Maturity Date relating to the Commitments held by the Approving
         Lenders shall be extended by an additional 364 days. Each of the
         parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that no Lender shall be
         obligated to extend the Maturity Date pursuant to the terms of this
         Section 2.4.

                  (d)      Replacement of Lenders. So long as no Default or
         Event of Default then exists, the Borrower may, not later than the 20th
         day prior to the First Extension Date and the Second Extension Date, as
         applicable, by writing addressed to the Administrative Agent and any
         Non-Extending Lender nominate or propose an Eligible Assignee that is
         willing to become the assignee of the Commitment and other obligations
         of such Non-Extending Lender (the "Replacement Lender") pursuant to
         Section 11.3. Each such Non-Extending Lender and Replacement Lender
         shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
         Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent
         shall specify to evidence such assignment, unless the Administrative
         Agent shall have notified the Borrower and the Non-Extending Lender
         that the proposed Replacement Lender is not reasonably acceptable to
         the Administrative Agent; provided, that in no event will (i) any
         Lender be required to enter into an Assignment Agreement at a price
         less than par plus accrued interest and prorated fees and other costs
         due hereunder to the effective date of such Assignment Agreement, (ii)
         the Administrative Agent or any Non-Extending Lender be obligated to
         assist the Borrower in identifying any Eligible Assignees that are
         willing to become a Replacement Lender or



                                       35
<PAGE>

         (iii) any such assignment be required if the consummation thereof
         conflicts with any Requirement of Law.

                                    SECTION 3

                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

         3.1      DEFAULT RATE.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the
rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, whether
in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then the Adjusted Base Rate plus
2%).

         3.2      EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
provided in Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans
or extended as Eurodollar Loans for new Interest Periods only on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) without the consent of the Required
Lenders, Eurodollar Loans may be extended, and Base Rate Loans may be converted
into Eurodollar Loans, only if the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2
are satisfied on the date of extension or conversion, (iii) Loans extended as,
or converted into, Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the terms of the
definition of "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such
minimum amounts as provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii), (iv) no more than five
Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood
that, for purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods
shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same
date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance with
the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to
constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period) and (v) any
request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan which shall fail to
specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest
Period of one month. Each such extension or conversion shall be effected by the
Borrower by giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) to the office of the Administrative Agent
specified in specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at such other office as the
Administrative Agent may designate in writing, prior to 12:00 Noon (Charlotte,
North Carolina time) on the Business Day of, in the case of the conversion of a
Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and on the second Business Day prior to,
in the case of the extension of a Eurodollar Loan as, or conversion of a Base
Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the date of the proposed extension or
conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or conversion, the
Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of Loans into which such Loans
are to be converted and, if appropriate, the applicable Interest Periods with
respect thereto. Each request for extension or conversion shall be irrevocable
and shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower of the
matters specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 5.2. In
the event the




                                       36
<PAGE>

Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan in
accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or extension is not
permitted or required by this Section, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be
automatically converted into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as
promptly as practicable of any such proposed extension or conversion affecting
any Loan.

         3.3      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
         right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time; provided,
         however, that each partial prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum
         principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000.
         Subject to the foregoing terms, amounts prepaid under this Section
         3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect; provided that if the
         Borrower fails to specify a voluntary prepayment then such prepayment
         shall be applied to Revolving Loans, in each case first to Base Rate
         Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period
         maturities. All prepayments under this Section 3.3(a) shall be subject
         to Section 3.12, but otherwise without premium or penalty.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i)      Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time
                  (A) the sum of the aggregate amount of the outstanding
                  Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations outstanding plus
                  Swingline Loans outstanding shall exceed the Revolving
                  Committed Amount, (B) the aggregate amount of LOC Obligations
                  outstanding shall exceed the LOC committed Amount or (C) the
                  aggregate amount of Swingline Loans outstanding shall exceed
                  the Swingline Committed Amount, the Borrower shall immediately
                  make payment on the Loans and/or cash collateralize the LOC
                  Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                           (ii)     Asset Dispositions. Promptly (and in any
                  event within 5 Business Days) after the occurrence of any
                  Asset Disposition, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an
                  aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
                  Net Cash Proceeds of the related Asset Disposition (such
                  prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (v) below).

                           (iii)    Debt Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by
                  the Consolidated Parties of proceeds from any Debt Issuance or
                  any Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the Borrower shall prepay
                  the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent
                  (100%) of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Debt Issuance or
                  Sale and Leaseback Transaction, as applicable (such prepayment
                  to be applied as set forth in clause (v) below).

                           (iv)     Equity Issuances. Promptly (and in any event
                  within 5 Business Days) after receipt by a Consolidated Party
                  of proceeds from any Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall
                  prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the




                                       37
<PAGE>

                  Net Cash Proceeds from such Equity Issuances (such prepayment
                  to be applied as set forth in clause (v) below).

                           (v)      Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All
                  amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.3(b) shall
                  be applied as follows: (A) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                  pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)(A), to the Revolving Loans and
                  (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid), to Swingline
                  Loans and (after all Swingline Loans have been repaid) to a
                  cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations, (B)
                  with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant to Section
                  3.3(b)(i)(B), to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC
                  Obligations, (C) with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant
                  to Section 3.3(b)(i)(C), to Swingline Loans, (D) with respect
                  to all amounts prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ii), first
                  to the Revolving Loans until paid in full, then to the
                  Swingline Loans until paid in full, and then to a cash
                  collateral account in respect to LOC Obligations, and with
                  respect to any Asset Disposition not permitted by Section 8.5,
                  each such prepayment made pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ii) shall
                  accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the Revolving
                  Committed Amount, (E) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                  pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(iii) and (iv), first to the
                  Revolving Loans until paid in full, then to the Swingline
                  Loans until paid in full, and then to a cash collateral
                  account in respect of LOC Obligations, provided, however, at
                  such time as the aggregate amounts prepaid pursuant to Section
                  3.3(b)(iii) exceed $35 million, each such prepayment made
                  pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(iii) shall be accompanied by a
                  corresponding reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any prepayment
                  pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ii), (iii) or (iv), so long as no
                  Default or Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall not be
                  required to cash collateralize the LOC Obligations outstanding
                  as of the date of such prepayment provided that the Revolving
                  Committed Amount as of the date of such prepayment exceeds the
                  LOC Obligations outstanding as of such date. Within the
                  parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments
                  shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to
                  Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period
                  maturities. All prepayments under this Section 3.3(b) shall be
                  subject to Section 3.12.

         3.4      TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT.

                  (a)      Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower may from time to
         time permanently reduce or terminate the Revolving Committed Amount in
         whole or in part (in minimum aggregate amounts of $5,000,000 or in
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the
         full remaining amount of the then applicable Revolving Committed
         Amount)) upon five Business Days' prior written notice to the
         Administrative Agent; provided, that, no such termination or reduction
         shall be made which would cause the sum of the aggregate principal
         amount of the outstanding Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations plus
         Swingline Loans to exceed the Revolving Committed Amount or unless,
         concurrently with such termination or reduction, the Loans are repaid
         to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The Administrative
         Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender of receipt by the
         Administrative Agent of any notice from the Borrower pursuant to this
         Section 3.4(a).



                                       38
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Mandatory Reductions. The Revolving Committed Amount
         automatically shall be permanently reduced in accordance with the terms
         of Section 3.3(b)(v).

                  (c)      Maturity Date. The Revolving Commitments of the
         Lenders, the LOC Commitment of the Issuing Lender and the Swingline
         Commitment of the Swingline Lender shall automatically terminate on the
         Maturity Date, as applicable.

         3.5      FEES.

                  (a)      Unused Fee. In consideration of the Revolving
         Commitments of the Lenders hereunder, the Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Unused
         Fee") equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum for Unused Fees then
         in effect on the Unused Revolving Committed Amount for each day during
         the applicable Unused Fee Calculation Period (hereinafter defined). The
         Unused Fee shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall be
         due and payable in arrears on the last business day of each March,
         June, September and December (and any date that the Revolving Committed
         Amount is reduced as provided in Section 3.4 and the Maturity Date) for
         the immediately preceding quarter (or portion thereof) (each such
         quarter or portion thereof for which the Unused Fee is payable
         hereunder being herein referred to as an "Unused Fee Calculation
         Period"), beginning with the first of such dates to occur after the
         Closing Date. For purposes of computation of the Unused Fees, the
         Swingline Loans shall not be counted toward or considered usage of the
         Revolving Committed Amount.

                  (b)      Letter of Credit Fees.

                           (i)      Standby Letter of Credit Issuance Fee. In
                  consideration of the issuance of standby Letters of Credit
                  hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative
                  Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Letter of
                  Credit Fee") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage
                  of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn
                  under each such standby Letter of Credit computed at a per
                  annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date
                  of expiration equal to the Applicable Percentage. The Standby
                  Letter of Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on
                  the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
                  December for the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion
                  thereof).

                           (ii)     Trade Letter of Credit Drawing Fee. In
                  consideration of the issuance of trade Letters of Credit
                  hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative
                  Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Trade Letter
                  of Credit Fee") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment
                  Percentage of the average daily maximum amount available to be
                  drawn under each such trade Letter of Credit computed at a per
                  annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date
                  of expiration equal to the Applicable Percentage. The Trade
                  Letter of Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on
                  the last Business Day of each March, June,



                                       39

                  September and December for the immediately preceding quarter
                  (or a portion thereof).

                           (iii)    Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the
                  Standby Letter of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (i)
                  above and the Trade Letter of Credit Fee payable pursuant to
                  clause (ii) above, the Borrower promises to pay to the Issuing
                  Lender for its own account without sharing by the other
                  Lenders (A) a letter of credit fronting fee of one-eighth
                  percent (1/8%) per annum on the average daily maximum amount
                  available to be drawn under outstanding Letters of Credit
                  payable quarterly in arrears with the Letter of Credit Fee,
                  and (B) customary charges from time to time of the Issuing
                  Lender with respect to the issuance, amendment, transfer,
                  administration, cancellation and conversion of, and drawings
                  under, such Letters of Credit (collectively, the "Issuing
                  Lender Fees").

         3.6      CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the adoption
or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or
compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then,
upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for such reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts
owing under this Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding
on the parties hereto.

         3.7      LIMITATION ON EURODOLLAR LOANS.

         If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Loan:

                  (a)      the Administrative Agent determines (which
         determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances
         affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not
         exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (b)      the Required Lenders determine (which determination
         shall be conclusive) and notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will
         not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding
         Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and
so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no
obligation to make additional Eurodollar



                                       40
<PAGE>

Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar
Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest
Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Eurodollar
Loans or convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with
the terms of this Credit Agreement.

         3.8      ILLEGALITY.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of
or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement,
(a) such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever
such circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder
to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Base
Rate Loan to Eurodollar Loans, shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time
as it shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Base Rate Loan
when a Eurodollar Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding
as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans
on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the
then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.12.

         3.9      REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

         If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

                         (i)        shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable
         Lending Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any
         Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, or its obligation to make Eurodollar
         Loans, or change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such
         Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement
         or its Notes in respect of any Eurodollar Loans (other than taxes
         imposed on the overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in
         which such Lender has its principal office or such Applicable Lending
         Office);

                         (ii)       shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any
         reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other
         than the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage utilized in the determination of
         the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or
         other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or
         commitments of, such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office),
         including the Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or



                                       41
<PAGE>

                         (iii)      shall impose on such Lender (or its
         Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other
         condition affecting this Credit Agreement or its Notes or any of such
         extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or
its Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender on demand such amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender requests compensation by the
Borrower under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender
to make or continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
Lender to receive the compensation so requested. Each Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of
such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming
compensation under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts
to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging
and attribution methods.

         3.10     TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.

         If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the
then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of a
conversion required by Section 3.8 hereof, on such earlier date as such Lender
may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless
and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances
specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no
longer exist:

                  (a)      to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
         have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that
         would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be
         applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

                  (b)      all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued
         by such Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued instead
         as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would
         otherwise be converted into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate
         Loans.



                                       42
<PAGE>

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave
rise to the conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this
Section 3.10 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such
circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other
Lenders are outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically
converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for
such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving
effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by
such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

         3.11     TAXES.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for
         the account of any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or
         under any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and
         without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties,
         levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
         liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender
         and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and
         franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of
         which such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the
         Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
         subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies,
         imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being
         hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall be
         required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
         payable under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document to any
         Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
         increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
         (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
         Section 3.11) such Lender or the Administrative Agent receives an
         amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
         been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make such deductions, (iii)
         such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
         taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
         law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative
         Agent, at its address referred to in Section 11.1, the original or a
         certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all
         present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
         property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any
         payment made under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to,
         this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document (hereinafter
         referred to as "Other Taxes").

                  (c)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the
         Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
         (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
         asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section
         3.11) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
         be) and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses)
         arising therefrom or with respect thereto.



                                       43

                  (d)      Each Lender that is not a United States person under
         Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign Lender"), on or prior to
         the date of its execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement in the
         case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or
         prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each
         other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing
         by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but only so long as such
         Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and
         the Administrative Agent with (i) Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or
         4224, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal
         Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits
         under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which
         reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or
         certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Credit Agreement
         is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the
         United States, (ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as
         appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
         Service, and (iii) any other form or certificate required by any taxing
         authority (including any certificate required by Sections 871(h) and
         881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code), certifying that such Lender is
         entitled to an exemption from or a reduced rate of tax on payments
         pursuant to this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

                  (e)      For any period with respect to which a Lender has
         failed to provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the
         appropriate form pursuant to Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is
         due to a change in treaty, law, or regulation occurring subsequent to
         the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such
         Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 3.11(a)
         or 3.11(b) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States;
         provided, however, that should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from
         or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to
         Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the
         Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request
         to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

                  (f)      If any Credit Party is required to pay additional
         amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section
         3.11, then such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change
         the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or
         reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such
         change, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (g)      Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment
         of Taxes, the applicable Credit Party shall furnish to the
         Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
         evidencing such payment.

                  (h)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
         agreement of the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and
         obligations of the Credit Parties contained in this Section 3.11 shall
         survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other
         obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the
         Commitments hereunder.

         3.12     COMPENSATION.

         Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense (including loss of
anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

                  (a)      any payment, prepayment, or conversion of a
         Eurodollar Loan for any reason (including, without limitation, the
         acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 9.2) on a date other than
         the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower for any reason
         (including, without limitation, the failure of any condition precedent
         specified in Section 5 to be satisfied) to borrow, convert, continue,
         or prepay a Eurodollar Loan on the date for such borrowing, conversion,
         continuation, or prepayment specified in the relevant notice of
         borrowing, prepayment, continuation, or conversion under this Credit
         Agreement.

With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued,
for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
convert or continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable
rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein (excluding,
however, the Applicable Percentage included therein, if any) over (b) the amount
of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued
to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable
period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. The covenants of
the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.12 shall survive the repayment of the
Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the
termination of the Commitments hereunder.

         3.13     PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

                  (a)      Loans. Each Loan, each payment or (subject to the
         terms of Section 3.3) prepayment of principal of any Loan or
         reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of
         Credit, each payment of interest on the Loans or reimbursement
         obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment
         of Unused Fees, each payment of the Standby Letter of Credit Fee, each
         payment of the Trade Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction in
         Commitments and each conversion or extension of any Loan, shall be
         allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective
         principal amounts of their outstanding Revolving Loans and
         Participation Interests.

                  (b)      Advances. No Lender shall be responsible for the
         failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make its
         ratable share of a borrowing hereunder; provided, however, that the
         failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not
         relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the
         Borrower or any Lender has



                                       45
<PAGE>

         notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is
         required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that
         the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such
         payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such
         Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but
         shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
         corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
         extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative
         Agent in immediately available funds, then:

                           (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each
                  Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative
                  Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made
                  available to such Lender in immediately available funds,
                  together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and
                  including the date such amount was made available by the
                  Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is
                  repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
                  funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect;
                  and

                           (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such
                  Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative
                  Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds,
                  together with interest thereon for the period from the date
                  such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
                  the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the
                  Administrative Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a rate per
                  annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
                  effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
                  Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's ratable
                  share of the applicable Revolving Loan. If such Lender does
                  not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
                  demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand
                  therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such
                  amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest
                  thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
                  to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Revolving
                  Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
                  from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice
                  any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may
                  have against any Lender as a result of any default by such
                  Lender hereunder.

                           A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or
                  the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this
                  subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

         3.14     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other




                                       46
<PAGE>

security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received
by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law
or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among
themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a
Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment,
including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such
Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan,
LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such Participation
Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if
any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative
Agent to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit
Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made
together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other
Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a
secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies, such
Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this
Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

         3.15     PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
         payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars
         in immediately available funds, without recoupment, setoff, deduction,
         counterclaim or withholding of any kind, at the Administrative Agent's
         office specified in Schedule 2.1(a) not later than 2:00 p.m.
         (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. Payments
         received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the
         next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent may (but shall
         not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not
         made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower or
         any other Credit Party maintained with the Administrative Agent (with
         notice to the Borrower or such other Credit Party). The Borrower shall,
         at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify
         to the Administrative Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest
         or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such
         payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify,
         or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the
         Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in
         such manner as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate
         in respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder,




                                       47
<PAGE>

         subject to the terms of Section 3.13(a)). The Administrative Agent will
         distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is
         received prior to 2:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a
         Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of such
         Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute
         such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day.
         Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which
         is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the
         next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees
         for the period of such extension), except that in the case of
         Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made
         in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead
         be made on the next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly
         provided otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall
         be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of
         360 days. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing,
         but exclude the date of payment.

                  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the
         contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
         of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any
         other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents or in
         respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of
         the Lenders under the Credit Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative
         Agent;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under
         the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
         consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                  FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Credit Party Obligations (including the payment or cash
         collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations);

                  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other
         obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit
         Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST"
         through "FIFTH" above; and

                  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.



                                       48
<PAGE>

         In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in
         the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to
         the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an
         amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the
         then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to
         the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts
         available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH"
         and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available
         for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to
         the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such
         amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral
         account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from
         time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B)
         then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other
         obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above
         in the manner provided in this Section 3.15(b).

         3.16     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
         evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to
         time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
         to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each
         Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its
         account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from
         time to time, as necessary.

                  (b)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register
         pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
         Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the
         amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the
         amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
         and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
         received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account
         of any Credit Party and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative
         Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the
         subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly
         update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.

                  (c)      The entries made in the accounts, Register and
         subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.16
         (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent,
         subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
         amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties therein recorded;
         provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
         Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount,
         as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the
         obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Credit Party obligations
         owing to such Lender.

                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1      THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement, and the
Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as
surety, the prompt payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a
mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the
terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit
Party Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as
a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization
or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the
same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations,
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity,
as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension
or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, the obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest
amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance
under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any
applicable state law.

         4.2      OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall
have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against
the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until
such time as the Lenders (and any Affiliates of Lenders entering into Hedging
Agreements) have been paid in full, all Commitments under this Credit Agreement
have been terminated and no Person or Governmental Authority shall have any
right to request any return or reimbursement of funds from the Lenders in
connection with monies received under the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the
following shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder
which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above:



                                       50
<PAGE>

                  (a)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Credit Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance
         or compliance shall be waived;

                  (b)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or any other
         agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or Hedging
         Agreements shall be done or omitted;

                  (c)      the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under
         any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or any other
         agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or Hedging
         Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Credit
         Party Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired
         or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (d)      any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or Lenders as security for any of
         the Credit Party Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e)      any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for
         the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated
         to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any
         creditor of any Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender
exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of
the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
referred to in the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, or against any other
Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit Party
Obligations.

         4.3      REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred
by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.



                                       51
<PAGE>

         4.4      CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
recourse to security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the
exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the
exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

         4.5      REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be
forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to
have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said
Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1.

         4.6      RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the Guaranteed Obligations, and none of
the Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against
any other Guarantor until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such
Guaranteed Obligations. For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) "Guaranteed
Obligations" shall mean any obligations arising under the other provisions of
this Section 4; (b) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor
in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) "Pro Rata
Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any payment of Guaranteed
Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such
payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate
present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the
amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent,
subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of all
of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of the Credit
Parties; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata
Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations,
any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such payment
shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and the
financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a
Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such payment;
and (d) "Contribution Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any
Excess Payment made by




                                       52
<PAGE>

any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of
such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair
salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all
debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated,
unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair
salable value of all assets and other properties of the Credit Parties other
than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of the debts and
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties) of the Credit
Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment; provided, however, that,
for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the Guarantors in respect
of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the
date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the
date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as
of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such
Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment. This Section 4.6 shall not be
deemed to affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or
contribution that any Guarantor may have under applicable law against the
Borrower in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations.

         4.7      GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

                                    SECTION 5

                                   CONDITIONS

         5.1      CLOSING CONDITIONS.

         The obligation of the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and
to make the initial Loans or the Issuing Lender to issue the initial Letter of
Credit, whichever shall occur first, shall be subject to satisfaction of the
following conditions (in form and substance acceptable to the Lenders):

                  (a)      Executed Credit Documents. Receipt by the

                                       58
<PAGE>

         Credit Parties, no event or condition has occurred or exists as a
         result of which any ERISA Event could reasonably be expected to occur,
         with respect to any Plan; (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as
         such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the

         valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made
         or deemed made (determined, in each case, in accordance with Financial
         Accounting Standards Board Statement 87, utilizing the actuarial
         assumptions used in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation

         Parties, could be reasonably expected to incur, any withdrawal
         liability under ERISA to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
         Plan. Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliate would
         become subject to any withdrawal liability under ERISA if any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw completely
         from all Multiemployer Plans and Multiple Employer Plans as of the
         valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
         representation is made or deemed made. Neither any Consolidated Party

         Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section
         4241 of ERISA), is insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of
         ERISA), or has been terminated (within the meaning of Title IV of

         Credit Parties, reasonably expected to be in reorganization, insolvent,
         or terminated.

         Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of
         fiduciary responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which has
         subjected or may subject any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate
         to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or
         Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other instrument
         pursuant to which any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate has
         agreed or is required to indemnify any Person against any such
         liability.

                  (e)      Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliates has any material liability with respect to "expected
         post-retirement benefit obligations" within the meaning of the
         Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106. Each Plan which is
         a welfare plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) to which Sections
         601-609 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code apply has been
         administered in compliance in all material respects of such sections.

                  (f)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Credit
         Agreement nor the consummation of the financing transactions
         contemplated thereunder will involve any transaction which is subject
         to the prohibitions of Sections 404, 406 or 407 of ERISA or in
         connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section 4975
         of the Code. The representation by the Credit Parties in the preceding
         sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the
         Lenders' representation in Section 11.15 with respect to their source
         of funds and is subject, in the event that the source of the funds used
         by the Lenders in connection with this transaction is an insurance
         company's general asset account, to the application of Prohibited
         Transaction Class Exemption 95-60, 60 Fed. Reg. 35,925 (1995),
         compliance with the regulations issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of
         ERISA, or the issuance of any other prohibited transaction exemption or
         similar relief, to the effect that assets in an insurance company's
         general asset account do not constitute assets of an "employee benefit
         plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA of a "plan" within
         the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code.

         6.12     SUBSIDIARIES.

         Set forth on Schedule 6.12 is a complete and accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of each Consolidated Party. Information on Schedule 6.12 includes
jurisdiction of incorporation, the number of shares of each class of Capital
Stock outstanding, the number and percentage of outstanding shares of each class
owned (directly or indirectly) by such Credit Party; and the number and effect,
if exercised, of all outstanding options, warrants, rights of conversion or
purchase and all other similar rights with respect thereto. The outstanding
Capital Stock of all such Subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and is owned by each such Consolidated Party, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of all Liens. Other than as set forth in Schedule
6.12, no Subsidiary has outstanding any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for its Capital Stock nor does any such Person have outstanding any
rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any options for the purchase of, or
any agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any
calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to its Capital Stock.
Schedule 6.12 may be updated from time to time by the Borrower by giving written
notice thereof to the Administrative Agent.

         6.13     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      No part of the Letters of Credit or proceeds of the
         Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, in a manner that would
         constitute a violation of Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X.
         "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not constitute
         more than 25% of the value of the consolidated assets of the
         Consolidated Parties. None of the transactions contemplated by this
         Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect
         use of the proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation
         of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange
         Act of 1934, as amended, or regulations issued pursuant thereto, or
         Regulation T, U or X. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative
         Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each
         Lender a statement to the effect of the foregoing sentences in
         conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in
         Regulation U.

         the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act

         withdrawal from, reorganization of (within the meaning of Section 4241
         of ERISA), or insolvency or (within the meaning of Section 4245 of
         ERISA) such Plan; or (iv) any prohibited transaction (within the
         meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach
         of fiduciary responsibility shall occur which may subject any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability under
         Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
         Code, or under any agreement or other instrument pursuant to which any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to
         indemnify any person against any such liability; or

                  (j)      Ownership. There shall occur a Change of Control.

         9.2      ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and at any time thereafter
unless and until such Event of Default has been waived by the requisite Lenders
(pursuant to the voting requirements of Section 11.6) or cured to the
satisfaction of the requisite Lenders (pursuant to the voting procedures in
Section 11.6), the Administrative Agent shall, upon the request and direction of
the Required Lenders, by written notice to the Credit Parties, take any of the
following actions:

                  (a)      Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments
         terminated whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b)      Acceleration. Declare the unpaid principal of and any
         accrued interest in respect of all Loans, any reimbursement obligations
         arising from drawings under Letters of Credit and any and all other
         indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind owing by the Credit
         Parties to the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder
         to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable
         without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all
         of which are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

                  (c)      Cash Collateral. Direct the Credit Parties to pay
         (and the Credit Parties agree that upon receipt of such notice, or upon
         the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(f), they will
         immediately pay) to the Administrative Agent additional cash, to be
         held by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in a
         cash collateral account as additional security for the LOC Obligations
         in respect of subsequent drawings under all then outstanding Letters of
         Credit in an amount equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be
         drawn under all Letters of Credits then outstanding.

                  (d)      Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
         interests created and existing under the Credit Documents including,
         without limitation, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all
         rights of set-off.

                                       76
<PAGE>

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in
Section 9.1(f) shall occur with respect to the Borrower, then the Commitments
shall automatically terminate and all Loans, all reimbursement obligations
arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, all accrued interest in respect
thereof, all accrued and unpaid Fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing
to the Administrative Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder automatically
shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of any notice or
other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders.

                                   SECTION 10

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

         10.1     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  (a)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates
         and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its
         behalf under the provisions of this Credit Agreement and each other
         Credit Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as
         are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Credit Agreement or
         any other Credit Document, together with such powers as are reasonably
         incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
         contained elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, the
         Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
         except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative
         Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
         Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
         responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into
         this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or otherwise exist
         against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of
         the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the
         other Credit Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is
         not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
         obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
         Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
         intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
         between independent contracting parties.

                  (b)      The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders
         with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents
         associated therewith, and the Issuing Lender shall have all of the
         benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in
         this Section 10 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by
         the Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or
         proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for
         letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if
         the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this Section 10 and in the
         definition of "Agent-Related Person" included the Issuing Lender with
         respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided
         herein with respect to the Issuing Lender.

         10.2     DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other
consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

         10.3     LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated hereby
(except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any
other Credit Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document,
or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or for any failure of any
Credit Party or any other party to any Credit Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

         10.4     RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

                  (a)      The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
         and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
         communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent,
         certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone
         message, electronic mail message, statement or other document or
         conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
         signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
         and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Credit
         Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the
         Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified
         in failing or refusing to take any action under any Credit Document
         unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
         Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it
         shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against
         any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
         of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative
         Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining
         from acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or
         such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in
         any instance) and such




                                       78
<PAGE>

         request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
         be binding upon all the Lenders.

                  (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the
         conditions specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this
         Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or
         accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter
         required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
         satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have
         received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date
         specifying its objection thereto.

         10.5     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Credit Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice
is a "notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of
its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action
with respect to such Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in
accordance with Section 9; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking
such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable or in the
best interest of the Lenders.

         10.6     CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT.

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or
review of the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and
all applicable bank or other regulatory laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Credit
Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other Credit Parties
hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not





                                       79
<PAGE>

have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
Agent-Related Person.

         10.7     INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Credit Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each
Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the
payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-Related
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no
action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be
deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this
Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other Credit
Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent
that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Commitments, the payment of all other Credit Party
Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.

         10.8     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective
Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent or the
Issuing Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The
Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its
Affiliates may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates
(including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in
favor of such Credit Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the
Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to
them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and
powers under this Credit Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such
rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the Issuing
Lender, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.



                                       80
<PAGE>

         10.9     SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' notice to the Lenders; provided that any such resignation by Bank of
America shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Lender and Swingline
Lender. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the
Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative
agent for the Lenders, which successor administrative agent shall be consented
to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of
Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, the
Person acting as such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Lender and Swingline Lender and the respective terms "Administrative Agent,"
"Issuing Lender" and "Swingline Lender" shall mean such successor administrative
agent, Letter of Credit issuer and swingline lender, and the retiring
Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be terminated and the retiring Issuing Lender's and Swingline Lender's
rights, powers and duties as such shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such retiring Issuing Lender or Swingline
Lender or any other Lender, other than the obligation of the successor Issuing
Lender to issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if
any, outstanding at the time of such succession or to make other arrangements
satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the
obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of
Credit. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 and Section 11.5 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no successor
administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the
date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

         10.10    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LOC Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise

                  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LOC
         Obligations and all other Credit Party Obligations that are owing and
         unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
         advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the
         Administrative




                                       81
<PAGE>

         Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
         disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
         and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the
         Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 3.5 and 11.5)
         allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                  (b)      to collect and receive any monies or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 3.5 and 11.5.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Credit Party Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.

         10.11    GUARANTY MATTERS.

         The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Guarantor from its obligations
hereunder if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction
permitted hereunder. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the
Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to
release any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder pursuant to this Section
10.11.

         10.12    OTHER AGENTS; ARRANGERS AND MANAGERS.

         None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or
signature pages of this Credit Agreement as a "syndication agent,"
"documentation agent," "co-agent," "book manager," "lead manager," "arranger,"
"lead arranger" or "co-arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Credit Agreement other than, in the
case of such Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting
the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or
be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or
other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this Credit Agreement or
in taking or not taking action hereunder.

                  address or telephone number as shall be designated by such
                  party in a notice to the other parties; and

                           (ii)     if to any other Lender, to the address,
                  facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number
                  specified in its Administrative Questionnaire or to such other

                  Lender and the Swingline Lender.

         All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given
         or made upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant
         party hereto and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when

         message be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation
         hereunder.

                  (b)      EFFECTIVENESS OF FACSIMILE DOCUMENTS AND SIGNATURES.
         Credit Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The
         effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to

         Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also
         require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a
         manually-signed original thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure
         to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any
         facsimile document or signature.

                  (d)      RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LENDERS. The
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act
         upon any notices (including telephonic Notice of Borrowing and
         Swingline Loan Requests) purportedly given by or on behalf of the
         Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified
         herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other
         form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as
         understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The
         Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and each Lender from
         all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance
         by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the
         Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other communications with the
         Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and
         each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

         11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF; ADJUSTMENTS.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender (or any
of its Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party
against any and all of the obligations of such Person now or hereafter existing
under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes, under any other Credit Document or
otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand under
hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify any affected Credit Party after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 11.2 are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Lender may have.

         11.3     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a)      The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be
         binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
         respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
         Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
         obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender
         and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
         obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
         with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
         participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of
         this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security
         interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) or (i) of this
         Section (and any other attempted assignment or




                                       84
<PAGE>

         transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this
         Credit Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
         upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
         successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent
         provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
         contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right,
         remedy or claim under or by reason of this Credit Agreement.

                  (b)      Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
         Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
         this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and
         the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b),
         participations in LOC Obligations and in Swingline Loans) at the time
         owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of
         the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and
         the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a
         Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in
         subsection (g) of this Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate
         amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
         outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as
         of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
         assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date"
         is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date,
         shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative
         Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to
         be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment
         shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement
         with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this
         clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of Swingline Loans;
         (iii) any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender
         unless the Person that is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender
         (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an
         Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties to each assignment shall
         execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
         Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
         Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
         pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the
         effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the
         Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Credit Agreement
         and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
         Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
         extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be
         released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the
         case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
         Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such
         Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
         entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6, 3.11, 3.12 and 11.5 with
         respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective
         date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense)
         shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment
         or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Credit
         Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
         for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a




                                       85
<PAGE>

         sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
         in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose
         as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative
         Agent's office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it
         and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
         Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and
         LOC Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
         time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
         conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
         may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant
         to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
         Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register
         shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at
         any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
         notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
         participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the
         Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
         "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or
         obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion of
         its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations
         in LOC Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); PROVIDED that
         (i) such Lender's obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain
         unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)
         the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall
         continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
         with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement.
         Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
         participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
         right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment,
         modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement;
         PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender
         will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
         amendment, waiver or other modification described in the proviso to
         Section 11.6 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to
         subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6, 3.11 and
         3.12 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
         interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To
         the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
         the benefits of Section 11.2 as though it were a Lender, provided such
         Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.14 as though it were a
         Lender.

                  (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
         payment under Section 3.6 or 3.11 than the applicable Lender would have
         been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
         Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant
         is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that
         would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to
         the benefits of Section 3.11 unless the Borrower is notified of the
         participation sold to such Participant



                                       86
<PAGE>

         and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply
         with Section 3.11(d) as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
         interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
         Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of
         such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
         to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
         shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
         substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
         hereto.

         11.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Administrative Agent or any
Lender and any of the Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or
thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5     EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)      The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to pay on
demand all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the
syndication, preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and
amendment of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, and the other
documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent (including
the cost of internal counsel) with respect thereto and with respect to advising
the Administrative Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under the Credit
Documents. The Credit Parties further jointly and severally agree to pay on
demand all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, if
any (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and
the cost of internal counsel), in connection with the enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of the Credit Documents
and the other documents to be delivered hereunder.

         (b)      The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each of their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and
advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by or asserted or
awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in
connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection
with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding or preparation





                                       87
<PAGE>

of defense in connection therewith) the Credit Documents, any of the
transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds
of the Loans (including any of the foregoing arising from the negligence of the
Indemnified Party), except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability,
cost, or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or
other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 11.5 applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any of the Credit Parties, their respective directors,
shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any
Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Credit Parties agree not
to assert any claim against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any of their
Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise
relating to the Credit Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or
the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

         (c)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit
Parties contained in this Section 11.5 shall survive the repayment of the Loans,
LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the
termination of the Commitments hereunder.

         11.6     AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

         Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any of
the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in
writing entered into by, or approved in writing by, the Required Lenders and the
Borrower, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that:

                  (a)      without the consent of each Lender affected thereby,
         neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document may be
         amended to

                           (i)      extend the final maturity of any Loan or of
                  any reimbursement obligation, or any portion thereof, arising
                  from drawings under Letters of Credit,

                           (ii)     reduce the rate or extend the time of
                  payment of interest (other than as a result of waiving the
                  applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates)
                  thereon or Fees hereunder,

                           (iii)    reduce or waive the principal amount of any
                  Loan or of any reimbursement obligation, or any portion
                  thereof, arising from drawings under Letters of Credit,

                           (iv)     increase the Commitment of a Lender over the
                  amount thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that
                  a waiver of any Default or Event of



                                       88
<PAGE>

                  Default or mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not
                  constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of any
                  Lender),

                           (v)      release the Borrower or substantially all of
                  the other Credit Parties from its or their obligations under

                  Section 11.6 or Section 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12,
                  3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 9.1(a), 11.2, 11.3, 11.5 or 11.9,

                           (vii)    reduce any percentage specified in, or
                  otherwise modify, the definition of Required Lenders, or

                           (viii)   consent to the assignment or transfer by the
                  Borrower or all or substantially all of the other Credit
                  Parties of any of its or their rights and obligations under
                  (or in respect of) the Credit Documents except as permitted
                  thereby;

                  (b)      without the consent of the Administrative Agent, no
         provision of Section 10 may be amended; and

                  (c)      without the consent of the Issuing Lender, no
         provision of Section 2.2 may be amended, and without the consent of the
         Swingline Lender, no provision of Section 2.3 may be amended.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
         required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender
         is entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy
         reorganization plan that affects the Loans, and each Lender
         acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy
         Code supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and
         (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a Credit Party to use
         cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
         proceeding.

         11.7     COUNTERPARTS.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in
making proof of this Credit Agreement to produce or account for more than one
such counterpart for each of the parties hereto. Delivery by facsimile by any of
the parties hereto of an executed counterpart of this Credit Agreement shall be
as effective as an original executed counterpart hereof and shall be deemed a
representation that an original executed counterpart hereof will be delivered.

         11.8     HEADINGS.

         The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are provided for

         limitation, in Section 3.11, 3.12, 10.5 or 11.5 shall survive the
         execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement, the making of the
         Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit, the repayment of the
         Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents
         and the termination of the Commitments hereunder, and all
         representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties herein shall
         survive delivery of the Notes and the making of the Loans hereunder.

                  (b)      All representations and warranties made hereunder and
         in any other Credit Document or other document delivered pursuant
         hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive
         the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and
         warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent
         and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and
         notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
         had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Loan or
         issuance of any Letter of Credit, and shall continue in full force and
         effect as long as any Loan or any other Credit Party Obligation
         hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit
         shall remain outstanding.

         11.10    GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

                  (a)      THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY
         PROVIDED THEREIN, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND
         OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED
         BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
         STATE OF NEW YORK. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this
         Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document may be brought in the
         courts of the State of North Carolina, or of the United States located
         in the State of North Carolina, and, by execution and delivery of this
         Credit Agreement, each of the Credit Parties hereby irrevocably accepts
         for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
         unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each of
         the Credit Parties further irrevocably consents to the service of
         process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
         proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified
         mail, postage prepaid, to it at the address set out for notices
         pursuant to Section 11.1, such service to become effective three (3)
         days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner
         permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or to otherwise
         proceed against any Credit Party in any other jurisdiction.

                  (b)      Each of the Credit Parties hereby irrevocably waives
         any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
         of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in
         connection with this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         brought in the courts referred to in subsection (a) above and hereby
         further
