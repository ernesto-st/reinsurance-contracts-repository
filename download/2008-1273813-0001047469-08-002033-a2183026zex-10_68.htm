<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, the
Investor proposes to grant to the Company an option to cause the Investor to
purchase from time to time additional Common Shares with an aggregate purchase
price of $750,000,000, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth

and Sale of Initial Shares</u>.&#160; On the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Investor will
purchase from the Company, and the Company will issue and sell to the Investor
or cause Assured Guaranty US Holdings Inc. (&#147;AGUS&#148;) to sell, a number of Common
Shares (the &#147;Initial Shares&#148;) equal to the quotient of $250,000,000 (the &#147;Initial
Investment&#148;) divided by the Initial Price (defined below).&#160; The &#147;Initial Price&#148; will be 97% of the
average of (A)&nbsp;$22.43 and (B)&nbsp;the average of the closing prices of a
Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;) on February&nbsp;29, 2008
and March&nbsp;3, 2008.&#160; The Initial
Price will in no event be less than $21.76.&#160;
For example, if the closing price of a Common Share on February&nbsp;29,
2008 were $26.00 and the closing price of a Common Share on March&nbsp;3, 2008
were $24.00, the Initial Price would be calculated as follows:&#160; ($22.43 + (($26+$24)/2))/2 = $23.715 and the
Initial Price would be $23.004 (i.e, 97% of $23.715).</font></p>

principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of September&nbsp;30, 2007, and there have been no changes in the

Company is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over

Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to engage in the review and
evaluation process mandated by the Exchange Act, and is in compliance with such

Chief Financial Officer of the Company (or each former Chief Executive Officer
of the Company and each former Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
