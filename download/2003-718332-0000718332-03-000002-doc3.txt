     Advance,  (c) the Type of the Revolving Credit Advance, and (d) in the case
of  a  LIBOR  Advance,  the  duration  of the Interest Period for such Revolving
Credit  Advance.  The  Bank  at  its  option  may accept telephonic requests for
Revolving  Credit Advances, provided that such acceptance shall not constitute a
waiver  of the Bank's right to delivery of an Advance Request Form in connection
with  subsequent  Revolving  Credit  Advances.  Any  telephonic  request  for  a
Revolving  Credit  Advance  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  promptly  confirmed by

Credit  Advance hereunder, and subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement,  the  Bank  will  make each Revolving Credit Advance available to the
Borrower  by  depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account
of  the  Borrower  (designated  by the Borrower) maintained with the Bank at the
Principal  Office.  All  notices  by  the  Borrower  under this Section shall be
irrevocable  and shall be given not later than 10:00 A.M. Dallas, Texas, time on
the  day  which is not less than the number of Business Days specified above for
such  notice.  No more than three (3) Interest Periods shall be in effect at the
same  time  for  the  Revolving  Credit  Loans.
Section  2.6.     Use  of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds of Revolving Credit Advances
                  -----------------

Revolving  Credit Commitment, for the period from and including the date of this
Agreement  to  and  including  the  Termination Date, at the Commitment Fee Rate
based  on  a  360  day  year  and the actual number of days elapsed. The accrued
Commitment  Fee  shall be payable in arrears on each Monthly Payment Date and on

outstanding  Revolving  Credit  Advances  and  Letter  of  Credit  Liabilities.

(b)     Voluntary  Reduction  or  Termination of Revolving CreditCommitment.  In
        ---------------------------------------------------------
addition  to  the  automatic  reductions required by the terms of Section 2.8(a)

     the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment upon at least two (2)
Business  Days'  prior  notice  (which  notice shall be irrevocable) to the Bank
specifying  the  effective  date  thereof, whether a termination or reduction is
being  made, and the amount of any partial reduction, provided that each partial
reduction  shall  be in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or

Section  2.9.     Letters  of  Credit.
                  -------------------
(a)     Pursuant  to  the  Existing  Loan  Agreement,  the  Bank  has issued the
Existing  Letters  of Credit which, on the Effective Date of this Agreement, are
in the aggregate amount of $230,000. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
     Agreement,  the  Bank  agrees  to  issue  one or more additional Letters of
Credit  for  the account of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary from time to
time  from  the  date  hereof  to  and including the Termination Date; provided,
however, the outstanding Letter of Credit Liabilities (including the face amount
of  the  Existing Letter of Credit) shall not at any time exceed an amount equal
to  the  aggregate amount of the then existing Revolving Credit Commitment minus
the  outstanding Revolving Credit Advances.  Each Letter of Credit shall have an
initial  expiration date not to exceed 365 days from the date of issuance, shall
not  have  an  expiration  date beyond the Termination Date, shall be payable in
Dollars,  shall  be  satisfactory in form and substance to the Bank and shall be
issued pursuant to such documents and instruments consistent with this Agreement
(including,  without limitation, the Bank's standard application for issuance of
letters  of  credit  as then in effect) as the Bank may reasonably require. Each
Letter of Credit shall be issued on at least five (5) Business Days prior notice
from  the  Borrower  to  the  Bank  by  means of a Letter of Credit Request Form
describing  the  transaction proposed to be supported thereby and specifying (1)
the  requested  date  of  issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (2) the face
amount of the Letter of Credit, (3) the expiration date of the Letter of Credit,
(4)  the  name and address of the beneficiary, (5) the conditions permitting the
drawing  or  drawings  thereunder  and  (6)  the form of the draft and any other
documents  required  to be presented at the time of any drawing (such request to
set forth the exact wording of such documents or to attach copies thereof). Upon
fulfillment  of the applicable conditions precedent in this Section 2.10(a), the
                                                            ---------------
Bank shall make the applicable Letter of Credit available to the Borrower or, if
so  requested  by  the  Borrower,  to  the  beneficiary of the Letter of Credit.
(b)     Each  Letter  of  Credit  Disbursement  shall constitute and be deemed a
Revolving  Credit Advance (which shall initially be a Prime Rate Advance) by the
Bank  to  the Borrower as of the day and time such Letter of Credit Disbursement
is made by the Bank and in the amount of such Letter of Credit Disbursement. The
Borrower  shall  pay  to the Bank a letter of credit fee on the outstanding face
amount  of  each Letter of Credit, for the period from and including the date of
issuance  of such Letter of Credit to the date of its expiration or termination,
at  a  per  annum  rate  equal to the applicable LIBOR Rate Margin for Revolving
Credit  Loans based on a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The
accrued letter of credit fee shall be payable in arrears on each Monthly Payment
Date  and  on  the  Termination  Date.
(c)     The obligations of the Borrower to reimburse the Bank for drawings under
each  Letter  of  Credit  shall  be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall  be  performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the  other  Loan Documents under all circumstances whatsoever, including without
limitation  the  following  circumstances:
(i)     Any  lack  of  validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any
other  Loan  Document;
(ii)     Any  amendment  or  waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan
Documents;
(iii)     The  existence  of  any  claim, setoff, counterclaim, defense or other
rights  which Borrower, any Obligated Party, or any other Person may have at any
time  against  the  beneficiary  of  any Letter of Credit, the Bank or any other
Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or
any  unrelated  transaction;
(iv)     Any  statement,  draft, or other document presented under any Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient in any respect
or  any  statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever;
(v)     Payment by the Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a
draft  or  other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit;  or
(vi)     Any  other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar
to  any  of  the  foregoing.
(d)     The  Borrower  assumes  all  risk  of  the  acts  or  omissions  of  any
beneficiary  of  any  Letter  of Credit with respect to its use of any Letter of
Credit.  Neither the Bank nor any of its affiliates, correspondents, officers or
directors  shall  have  any  responsibility  or liability to the Borrower or any
Person for (i) any error, loss, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
     dispatch  or  delivery of any one or more messages or advices in connection
with  any Letter of Credit, whether transmitted by cable, radio, telegraph, mail
or  otherwise  and despite any cipher or code which may be employed, or (ii) any
action,  inaction  or  omission  which may be taken or suffered by it or them in
good  faith  or  through  inadvertence in identifying or failing to identify any
beneficiary(ies)  or otherwise in connection with any Letter of Credit, or (iii)
the  validity,  sufficiency  or  genuineness of documents even if such documents
should  in  fact  prove  to  be  in  any  or all respects invalid, insufficient,
fraudulent  or  forged,  or  (iv)  any act, error, neglect or default, omission,
insolvency  or  failure  in business of any of the Bank's correspondents, or (v)
any  failure  of  the  beneficiary  of any Letter of Credit to comply fully with
conditions  required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, or (vi) if any
Letter  of Credit is transferable, the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring  or  assigning  or  purporting to transfer or assign such Letter of
Credit  or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part,  which  may  prove  to  be invalid or ineffective for any reason, or (vii)
errors  in interpretation of technical terms, or (viii) any consequences arising
from  causes beyond the control of the Bank. The happening of any one or more of
the contingencies referred to in the preceding sentence shall not affect, impair
or  prevent  the vesting of any of the Bank's rights or powers hereunder. If any
Letter  of  Credit (or any Loan Document executed in connection with a Letter of
Credit) shall be terminated or revoked by operation of law as to the Borrower or
any  applicant  under  any  Letter of Credit, or if the payment of any Letter of
Credit  shall  be restrained or attempted to be restrained by court order or any
other means, Borrower will indemnify and save the Bank harmless from any and all
loss,  cost,  damage,  expense  and  attorneys'  fees  which  may be suffered or
incurred  by  such Person. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of
the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Bank
under  or  in  connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in good
faith,  shall  not put the Bank under any resulting liability to the Borrower or
any  other Person. The Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be
in  order,  without  responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice  or  information  to  the  contrary.
                               ARTICLE  III.

                                Term  Loan
Section  3.1.     Term  Loan.  Borrower  hereby  represents and warrants that on
                  ----------
March  31,  2000, Bank made the Term Loan to Borrower in the principal amount of
$5,000,000.00  for  the  purpose  set forth in the Existing Loan Agreement.  The
obligation  of the Borrower to repay the Term Loan is currently evidenced by the
Term Note, upon which there is owing a principal balance of $1,666,667 as of the
     Effective  Date  of  this Agreement.  Borrower represents and warrants that
such  unpaid  amount is unconditionally owed by Borrower to Bank without offset,
defense, or counterclaim of any kind, nature or description whatsoever.  Subject
to  the  other  terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower may Convert
the  Term  Loan from one Type into another Type. The Term Loan shall be made and
maintained  at the Bank's Applicable Lending Office for an Advance of such Type.

the  Term  Note.
Section  3.4.     Interest.  The  unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan shall
                  --------
bear  interest  prior  to maturity at a varying rate per annum equal from day to
day to the lesser of (a) the Maximum Rate, or (b) the Applicable Rate. If at any
time  the  Applicable  Rate  shall  exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the
interest  accruing  on the Term Loan to be limited to the Maximum Rate, then any
subsequent  reduction  in  the  Applicable  Rate  shall  not  reduce the rate of
interest  on  the Term Loan below the Maximum Rate until the aggregate amount of
interest  accrued on the Term Loan equals the aggregate amount of interest which
would have accrued on the Term Loan if the Applicable Rate had at all times been
in  effect.  Accrued  and  unpaid  interest on the Term Loan shall be payable as
follows:
(i)     in  the  case  of all Prime Rate Advances, on each Monthly Payment Date;
(ii)     in  the  case  of  all LIBOR Advances, on the last day of each Interest
Period  applicable  thereto,  and  with respect to any Interest Period exceeding
three  (3)  months, on the last day of the third month after the commencement of
such  Interest  Period;  and
(iii)     on  the  Term  Loan  Maturity  Date.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any outstanding principal of the Term Loan and
(to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law)  any  other amount payable by the
Borrower  under  this  Agreement  or any other Loan Document that is not paid in
full  when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise) shall
bear interest at the Default Rate for the period from and including the due date
thereof  to but excluding the date the same is paid in full. Interest payable at
the  Default  Rate  shall  be  payable  from  time  to  time  on  demand.

     on  December  28,  2000,  Bank made the Real Estate Loan to Borrower in the
principal amount of $8,125,000.00 for the purposes set forth in the Construction
Loan  Agreement.  The  obligation  of  Borrower to repay the Real Estate Loan is
currently evidenced by the Real Estate Note, upon which there is currently owing
a  principal  balance  of $7,752,604 as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.
Borrower represents and warrants that such unpaid amount is unconditionally owed
by  Borrower to Bank without offset, defense or counterclaim of any kind, nature
or description whatsoever.  The outstanding principal balance of the Real Estate
Loan  bears  interest  and  is  payable  as  set  forth  in the Real Estate Loan
Documents.
Section  4.2.     Use  of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds of the Real Estate Loan were

                  -------------------
other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents  shall be made to the Bank at the Principal Office in Dollars and
in  immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, not
later  than  10:00  A.M.,  Dallas,  Texas time on the date on which such payment
shall  become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be
deemed  to  have  been  made  on the next succeeding Business Day). The Borrower
shall,  at  the  time  of making each such payment, specify to the Bank the sums
payable  by  the  Borrower  under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to
so  specify,  or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Bank
may  apply  such  payment  to the Obligations in such order and manner as it may
elect  in  its  sole  discretion,  subject to Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 hereof).
                                              ------------  ---     ---
Whenever  any  payment  under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be
stated  to  be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made
on  the  next  succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case  be  included  in the computation of the payment of interest and Commitment
Fee,  as  the  case  may  be.
Section  5.2.     Voluntary Prepayment.  The Borrower may, upon at least two (2)
                  --------------------
Business  Days'  prior  notice  to  the Bank, voluntarily prepay the Advances in
whole  at  any  time or from time to time in part without premium or penalty but
with  accrued  interest  to  the  date  of  prepayment on the amount so prepaid,
provided  that  (a) prepayment of LIBOR Advances may give rise to a claim by the
Bank  for  compensation under Section 6.6, and (b) each partial prepayment shall
                              -----------
be  in  the  principal  amount  of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or an
integral  multiple  of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in excess of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000). All notices under this Section shall be irrevocable
     and shall be given not later than 10:00 A.M. Dallas, Texas, time on the day
which  is  not  less  than  the number of Business Days specified above for such
notice.  If  the  Borrower  fails  to  specify  the  application of prepayments,

Advances  under  the  Revolving Credit Loan and then to LIBOR Advances under the
Revolving  Credit  Loan  (ii) second, to Prime Rate Advances under the Term Loan

outstanding  principal  amount  of  all  Revolving  Credit  Advances exceeds the
Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower shall immediately prepay the amount of
excess  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest on the amount so prepaid.  Any such
mandatory  prepayments  shall  be applied to such excess in the following order:
first  to  Prime  Rate  Advances  and  then  to  LIBOR  Advances.
Section  5.4.     Withholding  Taxes.  All payments by the Borrower of principal
                  ------------------
of  and interest on the Advances and of all fees and other amounts payable under
any Loan Document are payable without deduction for or on account of any present
or  future taxes, duties or other charges levied or imposed by the United States
of  America  or by any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any of
the  foregoing  through  withholding  or  deduction  with  respect  to  any such
payments.  If  any such taxes, duties or other charges are so levied or imposed,
the  Borrower  will  pay additional interest or will make additional payments in
such  amounts  so  that  every  net  payment of principal of and interest on the
Advances  and  of all other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, after
withholding  or deduction for or on account of any such present or future taxes,
duties or other charges, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or
therein,  provided  that  the  Borrower  shall  have  no  obligation to pay such
additional  amounts  to the Bank to the extent that such taxes, duties, or other
charges  are  imposed  on  or  measured  by  the  net  income of the Bank by any
jurisdiction.  The Borrower shall furnish promptly to the Bank official receipts
evidencing  any  such  withholding  or  reduction.

day but excluding the last day), except that interest on the Eurodollar Advances
shall  be  computed  on  the  basis  of  a  year  of  360  days.
                             ARTICLE  VI.

            Special  Provisions  Regarding  LIBOR  Advances
Section  6.1.     Conversions  and  Continuations.  The  Borrower shall have the
                  -------------------------------

one  Type into an Advance of another Type or to Continue LIBOR Advances as LIBOR
Advances  by giving the Bank written notice at least one (1) Business Day before
Conversion into a Prime Rate Advance and at least three (3) Business Days before
     Conversion  into  or  Continuation  of a LIBOR Advance, specifying: (a) the

Period with respect thereto, such LIBOR Advance shall be Converted automatically
into  a  Prime  Rate Advance on the last day of the then current Interest Period
for  such  LIBOR  Advance.
Section  6.2.     Additional  Costs.
                  -----------------
(a)     The  Borrower  shall  pay  directly  to  the Bank from time to time such
amounts as the Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it for any costs
     incurred  by the Bank which the Bank reasonably determines are attributable
to  its  making or maintaining of any LIBOR Advances hereunder or its obligation
to  make  any  of  such  Advances  hereunder,  or  any  reduction  in any amount
receivable  by  the  Bank  hereunder  in  respect  of  any such Advances or such
obligation  (such  increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being
herein  called  "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

The  Bank will notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this
Agreement  which  will entitle the Bank to compensation pursuant to this Article

                                ----------
after  the  initial occurrence of the event giving rise to such claim), and will
designate  a  different  Applicable  Lending Office for the Advances affected by
such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such  compensation  and  will  not, in the sole opinion of the Bank, violate any
law,  rule, or regulation or be in any way disadvantageous to the Bank, provided
that  the  Bank  shall  have no obligation to so designate an Applicable Lending
Office  located  in  the  United  States  of  America. The Bank will furnish the
Borrower  with  a  certificate  setting  forth  the basis and the amount of each

may,  by  notice  to  the  Bank  suspend  the  obligation of the Bank to make or
Continue  making, or Convert Advances into, Advances of the Type with respect to

incurs  Additional  Costs  based  on or measured by the excess above a specified
level  of  the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of the Bank
which  includes  deposits  by  reference  to  which  the  interest rate on LIBOR
Advances is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions
     of credit or other assets of the Bank which includes LIBOR Advances or (ii)
becomes  subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities
or  assets  which  it  may  hold,  then,  if the Bank so elects by notice to the
Borrower,  the  obligation  of  the  Bank to make or Continue making, or Convert
Advances  into,  Advances  of  such Type hereunder shall be suspended until such
Regulatory  Change  ceases  to  be  in  effect  (in which case the provisions of
Section  6.5  hereof  shall  be  applicable).

6.2  of  the  effect  of  any  Regulatory Change on its costs of maintaining its
---
obligations  to make Advances or of making or maintaining Advances or on amounts

receivable  by it in respect of Advances, and of the additional amounts required
to  compensate the Bank in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive,
provided  that such determinations and allocations are made in good faith and on
a  reasonable  basis  and  without  duplication of the LIBOR Reserve Percentage.
Section  6.3.     Limitation  on  Types  of  Advances.  Anything  herein  to the
                  -----------------------------------
contrary notwithstanding, if with respect to any LIBOR Advances for any Interest
     Period  therefore,  the  Bank  determines  (which  determination  shall  be
conclusive  if  made  in  good  faith) that quotations of interest rates for the
relevant  deposits  referred to in the definition of "Base LIBOR" in Section 1.1
                                                                     -----------
hereof  are  not  being  provided  in  the  relative amounts or for the relative
maturities for purposes of determining the rate of interest for such Advances as
provided  in this Agreement, then the Bank shall give the Borrower prompt notice
thereof  specifying  the  relevant  amounts  or  periods,  and  so  long as such
condition  remains  in  effect,  the  Bank  shall be under no obligation to make
additional  LIBOR Advances or to Convert Prime Rate Advances into LIBOR Advances
and  the  Borrower  shall,  on  the  last  day(s)  of  the then current Interest
Period(s)  for the outstanding LIBOR Advances, either prepay such LIBOR Advances
or  Convert  such LIBOR Advances into Prime Rate Advances in accordance with the
terms  of  this  Agreement. The Bank shall be deemed to have acted in good faith
under  this  Section 6.3 if the Bank is giving notice to its customers generally
             -----------
of  the  occurrence  of  either of the conditions specified in this Section 6.3.
                                                                    -----------
Section  6.4.     Illegality.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this
                  ----------
Agreement,  in the event that it becomes unlawful for the Bank or its Applicable
Lending  Office  to (a) honor its obligation to make LIBOR Advances hereunder or
(b)  maintain  LIBOR Advances hereunder, then the Bank shall promptly notify the
Borrower  thereof  and  the Bank's obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Advances
and  to  Convert  Prime  Rate  Advances  into  LIBOR Advances hereunder shall be
suspended until such time as the Bank may again make and maintain LIBOR Advances
(in  which  case  the  provisions  of  Section  6.5 hereof shall be applicable).

be Converted pursuant to Section 6.2 or 6.4 hereof, the Bank's Affected Advances
                         -----------    ---
shall  be automatically Converted into Prime Rate Advances on the last day(s) of
the  then  current Interest Period(s) for the Affected Advances (or, in the case
of  a  Conversion required by Section 6.2(b) or 6.4 hereof, on such earlier date
                              --------------    ---
as  the  Bank may specify to the Borrower), and, unless and until the Bank gives
notice  as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 6.2 or 6.4
                                                              -----------    ---
hereof  which  gave  rise  to  such  Conversion  no  longer  exist:
(a)     To  the extent that the Bank's Affected Advances have been so Converted,
all  payments  and  prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to
the  Bank's  Affected  Advances  shall  be  applied  instead  to  its Prime Rate
Advances;  and
(b)     All  Advances  which would otherwise be made or Continued by the Bank as
LIBOR  Advances  shall  be made as or Converted into Prime Rate Advances and all
Advances  of  the  Bank  which  would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Advances
shall  remain  as  Prime  Rate  Advances.
Section  6.6.     Compensation.  The  Borrower  shall  pay to the Bank, upon the

request of the Bank, which request shall be made within one hundred eighty (180)

below,  such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion
of the Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense incurred by it as a
result  of:
(a)     Any  payment, prepayment or Conversion of a LIBOR Advance for any reason
(including,  without  limitation,  the  acceleration of the outstanding Advances
pursuant  to  Section  13.2)  on  a  date other than the last day of an Interest
              -------------
Period  for  such  LIBOR  Advance;  or
(b)     Any  failure  by  the  Borrower  for  any  reason  (including,  without
limitation, the failure of any conditions precedent specified in Article VIII to
                                                                 ------------
be satisfied) to borrow, Convert, or prepay a LIBOR Advance on the date for such
borrowing,  Conversion,  or  prepayment,  specified  in  the  relevant notice of
borrowing,  prepayment,  or  Conversion  under  this  Agreement.
Without  limiting  the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include  an  amount  equal  to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
which  otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid or Converted
or  not  borrowed  for  the period from the date of such payment, Conversion, or
failure  to borrow to the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Advance
(or,  in  the  case  of  a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such LIBOR
Advance  which would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing) at
the applicable rate of interest for such LIBOR Advance provided for herein minus
(ii)  the interest component of the amount the Bank would have bid in the London
interbank  market.
Section  6.7.     Capital  Adequacy.  If,  after the date hereof, the Bank shall
                  -----------------
have  determined  in  good  faith  that  the  adoption  or implementation of any
applicable  law,  rule,  or  regulation  regarding  capital adequacy (including,
without limitation, any law, rule, or regulation implementing the Basle Accord),
     or  any  change  therein,  or  any  change  in  the  interpretation  or
administration  thereof  by  any  central  bank  or other Governmental Authority
charged  with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the
Bank (or its parent) with any guideline, request, or directive regarding capital
adequacy  (whether  or not having the force of law) of any central bank or other
Governmental  Authority  (including,  without limitation, any guideline or other
requirement  implementing  the  Basle  Accord),  has or would have the effect of
reducing  the  rate  of  return  on  the  Bank's  (or its parent's) capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby
to a level below that which the Bank (or its parent) could have achieved but for
such  adoption,  implementation, change or compliance (taking into consideration
the Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the
Bank to be material, then from time to time, within ten (l0) Business Days after
demand by the Bank, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate the Bank (or its parent) for such reduction; provided
that  any  claim by the Bank for compensation pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall
                                                               -----------
be made within ninety (90) days after the initial occurrence of the event giving
rise  to  such claim. A certificate of the Bank claiming compensation under this
Section  and  setting  forth  the  additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder  shall  be conclusive, provided that the determination thereof is made
in  good faith and on a reasonable basis. In determining such amount or amounts,
the  Bank  may  use  any  reasonable  averaging  and  attribution  methods.

     To  induce  the  Bank to enter into this Agreement, the Borrower represents
and  warrants  to  the  Bank  as  follows:
Section 9.1.     Corporate Existence.  The Borrower and each Subsidiary (a) is a

corporate power and authority to own its assets and carry on its business as now
being or as proposed to be conducted; and (c) is qualified to do business in all
jurisdictions  in  which  the  nature  of  its business makes such qualification

properties.  The  Borrower  and  each  Subsidiary  has  the  corporate power and
authority  to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under this Agreement

financial  statements  of  the  Borrower  and its Subsidiaries for the three (3)
month  period  ended September 30, 2002.  Such financial statements are true and

present,  on  a  consolidated basis, the financial condition of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates indicated therein and the results of

conditions,  if  any,  have  subjected or could in the reasonable opinion of the
Bank  subject  the Borrower to any tax, penalty, or other liability to a Plan, a
Multiemployer Plan, the PBGC, or otherwise (or any combination thereof) which in
the  aggregate  exceed  or  could  reasonably be expected to exceed Five Hundred

                 ---------------
THE  BORROWER  SHALL  INDEMNIFY  THE  BANK  AND EACH OF ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE  OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, AND AGENTS FROM, AND HOLD
EACH OF THEM HARMLESS AGAINST, ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES,
PENALTIES,  JUDGMENTS,  DISBURSEMENTS, COSTS, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE
ATTORNEYS'  FEES)  TO  WHICH  ANY  OF  THEM MAY BECOME SUBJECT WHICH DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY  ARISE  FROM  OR  RELATE TO (A) THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY,
PERFORMANCE,  ADMINISTRATION,  OR  ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, (B)
ANY  OF  THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, (C) ANY BREACH BY

INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  ANY  THREATENED  INVESTIGATION, LITIGATION, OR
OTHER  PROCEEDING  RELATING  TO  ANY  OF  THE  FOREGOING.  WITHOUT  LIMITING ANY
PROVISION  OF  THIS  AGREEMENT  OR OF ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, IT IS THE EXPRESS
INTENTION  OF  THE  PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH PERSON TO BE INDEMNIFIED UNDER THIS
SECTION  SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED FROM AND HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES,
LIABILITIES,  CLAIMS,  DAMAGES,  PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS, DISBURSEMENTS, COSTS, AND
EXPENSES  (INCLUDING  ATTORNEYS' FEES) ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THE SOLE
OR  CONTRIBUTORY  NEGLIGENCE  OF SUCH PERSON BUT NOT ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING
FROM  THE  GROSS  NEGLIGENCE  OR  WILLFUL  MISCONDUCT  OF  SUCH  PERSON.
Section  14.3.    Limitation  of Liability.  None of the Bank, or any Affiliate,
                  ------------------------
officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent thereof shall have any liability
with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue
any  of  them  upon,  any  claim  for  any  special,  indirect,  incidental,  or
consequential  damages  suffered or incurred by the Borrower in connection with,
arising  out  of,  or  in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of  the other Loan Documents, except for such Person's willful misconduct, gross
negligence  or  failure to comply with the express provisions of any of the Loan
Documents.  The Borrower hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue the Bank
or  any  of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, or agents
for punitive damages in respect of any claim in connection with, arising out of,
or  in any way related to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or

disclosure,  duty  of  loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or obligation of any
type  or nature whatsoever to the Borrower or any of the Borrower's shareholders
or  any  other  Person.
Section  14.5.    No  Fiduciary  Relationship.  The  relationship  between  the
                  ---------------------------
Borrower  and each Bank is solely that of debtor and creditor, and the Bank does
not  have  any fiduciary or other special relationship with the Borrower, and no
term  or condition of any of the Loan Documents shall be construed so as to deem
the  relationship  between  the  Borrower  and the Bank to be other than that of
debtor  and  creditor.
Section  14.6.    Equitable  Relief.  The  Borrower recognizes that in the event
                  -----------------
the  Borrower  fails  to  pay,  perform, observe, or discharge any or all of the
Obligations,  any  remedy  at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Bank.
The  Borrower  therefore agrees that the Bank, if the Bank so requests, shall be
entitled  to  temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without
the  necessity  of  proving  actual  damages.
Section  14.7.    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure on the part of the
                  ------------------------------
Bank  to  exercise  and  no  delay  in exercising, and no course of dealing with
respect to, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as
a  waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies
provided  for  in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
not  exclusive  of  any  rights  and  remedies  provided  by  law.
Section  14.8.    Successors;  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon
                  -----------------------
and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  the Bank and the Borrower and their respective
successors  and  assigns; provided however, that (a) the Borrower may not assign
or  transfer its interest hereunder without Bank's prior written consent and (b)
the  Bank  must  give  notice  to the Borrower at least sixty (60) days prior to
assigning  its  interest  hereunder.
Section  14.9.    Participations.  The Bank shall have the right at any time and
                  --------------
from  time  to  time  to  grant  participations  in the Notes and any other Loan
Documents.  Each actual or proposed participant shall be entitled to receive all
information  received  by  the  Bank  regarding the Borrower, including, without
limitation,  information  required  to be disclosed to a participant pursuant to
Banking  Circular  181  (Rev., August 2, 1984), issued by the Comptroller of the
Currency  (whether the actual or proposed participant is subject to the circular
or  not).
Section  14.10.    Survival.  All  representations  and  warranties made in this
                   --------
Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document  or  in  any  document,  statement, or
certificate  furnished  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  shall survive the
execution  and  delivery  of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and no
investigation  by  the  Bank or any closing shall affect the representations and
warranties  or the right of the Bank to rely upon them. Without prejudice to the
survival  of  any other obligation of the Borrower hereunder, the obligations of
the Borrower under Article VI and Sections 14.1 and 14.2 shall survive repayment
                   ----------     -------------     ----
of  the  Notes  and  termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment and the Term
Commitment.
Section  14.11.    ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  THIS  AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, AND THE OTHER
                   -----------------
LOAN  DOCUMENTS  REFERRED TO HEREIN EMBODY THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE
PARTIES  HERETO  AND  SUPERSEDE  ANY  AND  ALL  PRIOR  COMMITMENTS,  AGREEMENTS,
REPRESENTATIONS,  AND  UNDERSTANDINGS,  WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, RELATING TO THE
SUBJECT  MATTER  HEREOF  AND  MAY  NOT  BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY EVIDENCE OF
PRIOR,  CONTEMPORANEOUS,  OR  SUBSEQUENT  ORAL  AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE
PARTIES  HERETO.  THERE  ARE  NO  ORAL  AGREEMENTS  AMONG  THE  PARTIES  HERETO.
Section  14.12.    Amendments,  Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of
                   ----------------
this Agreement, the Notes, or any other Loan Document to which the Borrower is a
party,  nor any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any
event  be  effective unless the same shall be agreed or consented to by the Bank
and the Borrower, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific  instance  and  for  the  specific  purpose  for  which  given.
Section  14.13.    Maximum  Interest Rate.  No provision of this Agreement or of
                   ----------------------
any  other Loan Document shall require the payment or the collection of interest
in  excess  of  the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. If any excess of
interest  in  such respect is hereby provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be
so  provided,  in  any  Loan  Document or otherwise in connection with this loan
transaction, the provisions of this Section shall govern and prevail and neither
the  Borrower  nor  the  sureties,  guarantors,  successors,  or  assigns of the
Borrower  shall  be  obligated  to pay the excess amount of such interest or any
other  excess  sum  paid  for  the use, forbearance, or detention of sums loaned
pursuant  hereto.  In  the event any Bank ever receives, collects, or applies as
interest  any  such  sum,  such  amount  which would be in excess of the maximum
amount  permitted  by applicable law shall be applied as a payment and reduction
of  the  principal  of  the  indebtedness  evidenced  by  the Notes; and, if the
principal  of  the  Notes  has  been  paid  in  full, any remaining excess shall
forthwith  be  paid  to the Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest
paid  or  payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Borrower and each Bank shall, to
the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law,  (a) characterize any non-principal
payment  as  an  expense,  fee,  or premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude
voluntary  prepayments  and  the  effects  thereof,  and  (c) amortize, prorate,
allocate,  and  spread  in  equal  or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout  the  entire  contemplated  term of the indebtedness evidenced by the
Notes  so  that  interest  for the entire term does not exceed the Maximum Rate.
Section 14.14.    Notices.  All notices and other communications provided for in
                  -------
this  Agreement  and  the  other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party
shall  be  given or made by telex, telegraph, telecopy, cable, or in writing and
telexed,  telecopied,  telegraphed,  cabled,  mailed  by  certified  mail return
receipt  requested,  or  delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address for
Notices"  specified  below its name on the signature pages hereof; or, as to any
party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a notice to
each  other  party  given  in  accordance with this Section. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all such communications shall be deemed to have been
duly  given  when  transmitted  by  telex  or  telecopy,  subject  to  telephone
confirmation  of receipt, or delivered to the telegraph or cable office, subject
to  telephone  confirmation  of receipt, or when personally delivered or, in the
case of a mailed notice, when duly deposited in the mails, in each case given or
addressed  as  aforesaid;  provided,  however,  notices  to the Bank pursuant to
Article  II  shall  not  be  effective  until  received  by  the  Bank.
Section  14.15.    Governing  Law;  Venue;  Service  of Process.  This Agreement
                   --------------------------------------------

all  purposes  in  Dallas  County,  Texas.  Any action or proceeding against the
Borrower under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents may be brought in
any  state  or  federal  court  in  Dallas  County,  Texas.  The Borrower hereby
irrevocably (a) submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and (b)
waives  any  objection  it may now or hereafter have as to the venue of any such
action  or  proceeding  brought  in  any such court or that any such court is an
inconvenient  forum.  The Borrower agrees that service of process upon it may be
made  by  certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, at its address
specified  or  determined  in  accordance  with the provisions of Section 14.13.
                                                                  -------------
Nothing  herein  or in any of the other Loan Documents shall affect the right of
the  Bank  to  serve process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit
the  right of the Bank to bring any action or proceeding against the Borrower or
with  respect  to  any of its property in courts in other jurisdictions.     Any
action  or  proceeding  by  the  Borrower against the Agent or any Bank shall be
brought  only  in  a  court  located  in  Dallas  County,  Texas.
Section  14.16.     Arbitration.
                   -----------
(a)     Arbitration.  Upon  the  demand  of  any  party,  any  Dispute  shall be
        -----------
resolved  by binding arbitration (except as set forth in subsection(e) below) in
                                                         -------------
accordance  with the terms of this Agreement. A "Dispute" shall mean any action,
                                                 -------
dispute,  claim  or  controversy  of  any  kind,  whether  in  contract or tort,
statutory  or  common law, legal or equitable, now existing or hereafter arising
under  or  in  connection  with,  or  in  any way pertaining to, any of the Loan
Documents,  or  any  past,  present  or  future  extensions  of credit and other
activities,  transactions  or  obligations  of  any  kind  related  directly  or
indirectly  to  any  of the Loan Documents, including without limitation, any of
the  foregoing  arising  in  connection  with  the  exercise  of  any self-help,
ancillary or other remedies pursuant to any of the Loan Documents. Any party may
     by  summary proceedings bring an action in court to compel arbitration of a
Dispute.  Any  party  who  fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a
lawful  demand  by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by
such  other  party  in  compelling  arbitration  of  any  Dispute.
(b)     Governing  Rules.  Arbitration  proceedings shall be administered by the
        ----------------
American  Arbitration  Association  ("AAA")  or  such other administrator as the
                                      ---
parties  shall  mutually  agree  upon  in  accordance  with  the  AAA Commercial
Arbitration  Rules.  All  Disputes submitted to arbitration shall be resolved in
accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code),
notwithstanding  any  conflicting  choice  of  law  provision in any of the Loan
Documents. The arbitration shall be conducted at a location in Texas selected by
the  AAA or other administrator. If there is any inconsistency between the terms
hereof  and  any  such  rules,  the  terms and procedures set forth herein shall
control. All statutes of limitation applicable to any Dispute shall apply to any
arbitration  proceeding.  All discovery activities shall be expressly limited to
matters  directly  relevant  to  the Dispute being arbitrated. Judgment upon any
award  rendered  in  an  arbitration  may  be  entered  in  any  court  having
jurisdiction; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
be  a waiver by any party that is a bank of the protections afforded to it under
12  U.S.C.   91  or  any  similar  applicable  state  law.
(c)     No  Waiver;  Provisional  Remedies,  Self  Help  and  Foreclosure.  No
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
provision  hereof  shall  limit  the  right  of  any party to exercise self-help
remedies  such  as  setoff,  foreclosure against or sale of any real or personal
property collateral or security, or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies,
including  without  limitation  injunctive  relief,  sequestration,  attachment,
garnishment  or  the  appointment  of  a  receiver,  from  a  court of competent
jurisdiction  before,  after  or during the pendency of any arbitration or other
proceeding.  The  exercise  of  any such remedy shall not waive the right of any
party  to  compel  arbitration  hereunder.
(d)     Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers Awards.  Arbitrators must be active
        -------------------------------------------
members of the Texas State Bar with expertise in the substantive laws applicable
to  the  subject  matter  of  the  Dispute. Arbitrators are empowered to resolve
Disputes  by  summary  rulings  in  response to motions filed prior to the final
arbitration  hearing.  Arbitrators  (i) shall resolve all Disputes in accordance
with  the  substantive  law  of the state of Texas, (ii) may grant any remedy or
relief  that a court of the state of Texas could order or grant within the scope
hereof  and  such  ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award,
and  (iii)  shall  have  the  power  to award recovery of all costs and fees, to
impose  sanctions  and  to take such other actions as they deem necessary to the
same  extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the
Texas Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable law. Any Dispute in which the
amount  in  controversy  is  $5,000,000  or  less  shall  be decided by a single
arbitrator  who  shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000 (including
damages,  costs,  fees and expenses). By submission to a single arbitrator, each
party  expressly  waives any right or claim to recover more than $5,000,000. Any
Dispute  in  which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 shall be decided
by  majority  vote  of  a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all
three  arbitrators  must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations.
(e)     Judicial  Review.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the contrary, in
        ----------------
any  arbitration  in  which  the  amount in controversy exceeds $25,000,000, the
arbitrators  shall  be  required  to make specific, written findings of fact and
conclusions  of  law. In such arbitration (i) the arbitrators shall not have the
power  to make any award which is not supported by substantial evidence or which
is  based  on  legal  error, (ii) an award shall not be binding upon the parties
unless  the  findings  of  fact  are  supported  by substantial evidence and the
conclusions  of  law are not erroneous under the substantive law of the state of
Texas,  and  (iii) the parties shall have in addition to the grounds referred to
in  the  Federal  Arbitration Act for vacating, modifying or correcting an award
the right to judicial review of (A) whether the findings of fact rendered by the
arbitrators  are  supported  by  substantial  evidence,  and  (B)  whether  the
conclusions  of  law  are  erroneous  under  the substantive law of the state of
Texas.  Judgment confirming an award in such a proceeding may be entered only if
a  court determines the award is supported by substantial evidence and not based
on  legal  error  under  the  substantive  law  of  the  state  of  Texas.
(f)     Miscellaneous.  To  the  maximum  extent  practicable,  the  AAA,  the
        -------------
arbitrators  and  the  parties  shall  take  all action required to conclude any
arbitration  proceedings  within  one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing of
the  Dispute  with  the  AAA.  No  arbitrator  or  other party to an arbitration
proceeding  may  disclose  the existence, content or results thereof, except for
disclosures  of  information  by  a party required in the ordinary course of its
business,  by  applicable  law  or  regulations,  or  to the extent necessary to
exercise any judicial review rights set forth herein. If more than one agreement
for  arbitration by or between the parties potentially applies to a Dispute, the
arbitration  provisions  most  directly  related  to  the  Loan Documents or the
subject  matter  of  the Dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall
survive termination, amendment or expiration of any of the Loan Documents or any
relationship  between  the  parties.
Section  14.17.    Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
                   ------------
counterparts,  each  of  which  shall  be  deemed  an original, but all of which
together  shall  constitute  one  and  the  same  instrument.
Section 14.18.    Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held by a court
                  ------------
of  competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid or unenforceable shall not impair or
invalidate  the  remainder  of  this  Agreement  and the effect thereof shall be
confined  to  the  provision  held  to  be  invalid  or  illegal.
Section  14.19.    Headings.  The  headings,  captions, and arrangements used in
                   --------
this  Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation
of  this  Agreement.
Section  14.20.    Non-Application  of  Chapter  346 of Texas Finance Code.  The
                   -------------------------------------------------------
provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code are specifically declared by
the  parties  hereto  not to be applicable to this Agreement or any of the other
Loan  Documents  or  to  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.
Section 14.21.    Construction.  The Borrower and the Bank acknowledge that each
                  ------------
of  them  has  had  the  benefit of legal counsel of its own choice and has been
afforded  an  opportunity  to review this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with  its  legal  counsel  and  that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall  be  construed  as  if  jointly  drafted  by  the  parties  hereto.
Section  14.22.    Independence  of Covenants.  All covenants hereunder shall be
                   --------------------------
given  independent  effect  so  that  if a particular action or condition is not
permitted  by  any  of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception  to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall
not  avoid the occurrence of a Default if such action is taken or such condition
exists.
Section  14.23.    WAIVER  OF  JURY  TRIAL.  TO  THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                   -----------------------
APPLICABLE  LAW,  EACH  OF  THE  PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY
WAIVES  ALL  RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER  BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
ANY  OF  THE  LOAN  DOCUMENTS  OR  THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS  OF THE BANK IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
Section  14.24.    NOTICE  OF  INDEMNIFICATION.  THE  PARTIES  TO THIS AGREEMENT
                   ---------------------------
HEREBY  ACKNOWLEDGE  AND  AGREE  THAT  THIS  AGREEMENT  CONTAINS  CERTAIN
INDEMNIFICATION  PROVISIONS  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  14.2  HEREOF.
                                           -------------
