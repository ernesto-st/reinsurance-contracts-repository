made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their applicable Commitments; <I>provided, however</I>,
that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). The
Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000 (except, with respect to any Incremental
Borrowing, to the extent otherwise provided in the related Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement).

its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; <I>provided </I>that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Lender
shall not be entitled to any amounts payable under Sections&nbsp;2.14 or 2.20 solely in respect of
increased costs resulting from such exercise and existing at the time of such exercise. Borrowings
of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; <I>provided, however</I>, that the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made, would result in&nbsp;more than eight
Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings
having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be
considered separate Borrowings.

Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account designated by the
Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date

available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall

Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon,
