void. Within 30 Business Days after the Transferability Date listed on your Award Statement (or any other date on which the Transfer Restrictions are to be removed), GS Inc. will remove the Transfer Restrictions. The Committee or the SIP Committee
may select multiple dates within such 30 Business-Day-period on which to remove Transfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Restricted Shares with the same Transferability Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated
as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award.<B> </B></P>
