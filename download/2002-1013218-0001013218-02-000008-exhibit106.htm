<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers and Guarantor hereby covenant and agree to keep Lenders and Agent apprised of the status of the negotiation of the refinancing on a regular basis.  Borrowers and Guarantor have previously delivered to Agent a copy of an executed commitment letter from a potential lender.

Upon the receipt by Lenders and Agent on or before October 31, 2002 of t
he Minimum Net Proceeds from the refinance of any Refinance Property, Lenders and Agent shall deliver an Interim Deficiency Waiver with respect to such Refinance Property in the amount of the Allocated Deficiency Waiver Amount applicable to such Refinance Property.</P>

<P>H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers and Guarantor are in default under the Financing Documents.  As a result of such defaults (collectively, the &quot;Default&quot;), Borrowers, Guarantor, Agent and Lenders have entered into a Collateral Disposition Agreement dated as of October 8, 2002 (the &quot;Collateral Disposition Agreement&quot;).  Among other things, the Collateral Disposition Agreement provides for Borrowers to provide one or more deeds in lieu of foreclosure to Agent or its designee or nominee (in any such case, &quot;Transferee&quot;) under certain circumstances more specifically set forth therein.  The Parties enter into this Agreement in order to provide for such a deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Property.</P>
<P>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgagor owns fee simple title to the Subject Real Property and owns all or substantially all of the Subject Personal Property, provided that Guarantor does, or may, own or have some interest in certain of the Subject Personal Property.  As used in this Agreement, the term &quot;Owner&quot; means Mortgagor and, to the extent of any interest either thereof may own or hold in any of the Property, Guarantor and the Borrower which is not Mortgagor.</P>
<P>J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of __________, 2002, the total outstanding principal balance of the Credit Facility was $______________ and certain accrued and unpaid interest thereon and fees and expenses in connection therewith were also owing to Agent and/or Lenders under the terms of the Financing Documents.</P>
<P>K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owner has determined that it is to Owner's advantage that the parties resolve the Default by Owner's conveyance of the Property to Transferee in lieu of foreclosure and has, therefore, requested that Agent agree to such a conveyance.</P>
<P>L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Disposition Agreement, in connection with the Closing hereunder, [i] Transferee and Guarantor will enter into a Lease and Management Agreement substantially in the form attached as an annex to the Collateral Disposition Agreement (the &quot;Lease and Management Agreement&quot;) [and (ii) Agent and Lenders will deliver the [Interim Deficiency Waiver] [Final Deficiency Waiver] substantially in the form annexed to the Collateral Disposition Agreement (the &quot;Waiver&quot;)].</P>
<P>M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair market value of the Property does not exceed the Allocated Deficiency Waiver Amount (as defined in the Collateral Disposition Agreement) with respect to the Property.</P>
<P>N.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agent wishes to accept the conveyance of the Property to Transferee pursuant to this Agreement to avoid the necessity of litigation, foreclosure, the delays associated therewith, and to avoid the delays associated with Owner's statutory redemption rights, if any, with respect to the Property.</P>

<u>Representations and Warranties of Owner</U>.  Owner represents and warrants to Lender as follows:</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Bankruptcy</U>.  <B>[*Revise as appropriate if Guarantor has filed for bankruptcy.*]</B> Neither Guarantor nor either Borrower has filed a petition in any case, action, or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any similar state law; no petition in any case, action, or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any similar state law has been filed against Guarantor or either Borrower that has not been dismissed or vacated; and neither Guarantor nor either Borrower has made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors (as distinguished from a transfer of collateral to a creditor with an interest in such collateral) or consented to the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a material part of its property.  The transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not a preference, voidable transfer, fraudulent transfer or otherwise in violation of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar state or federal law.  If Guarantor or either Borrower should become the debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code prior t
o the Closing, such debtor will promptly file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authority to complete performance of its obligations under this Agreement and to proceed with Closing.  Borrowers and Guarantor have received reasonably equivalent value (as that term is used in Bankruptcy Code Section 548 and the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act) and fair consideration in return for entering into, and performing their obligations under, this Agreement.</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Arm's-Length Transaction</U>.  Owner has requested conveyance of title to the Property in lieu of the exercise of the remedies available to Agent and Lenders pursuant to the Financing Documents and throughout the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement has been, and will through the Closing be, represented by competent legal counsel of Owner's own choosing.  This Agreement was entered into out of the free will of Owner and pursuant to arm's-length negotiations and Owner believes this Agreement is fair.  Agent has not taken advantage of Owner and Owner is proceeding in this transaction as a volunteer in what it perceives to be Owner's own best interest.</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Owner has not had any dealings with any broker or finder that would give any broker or finder the right to be paid a commission in connection with the transfer of the Property pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Owner hereby incorporates all representations and warranties made by Owner in the Collateral Disposition Agreement  with respect to Owner and with respect to the Property as if they were set forth in full herein and represents and warrants that they remain true and correct on the date of this Agreement, except as set forth on <U>Exhibit S</U>.

The conveyance of the Property to Transferee according to the terms of this Agreement is an absolute conveyance of all of Owner's right, title, and interest in and to the Property in fact as well as form and was not, and is not now, intended as a mortgage, trust conveyance, deed of trust or security instrument of any kind, and the consideration for such conveyance is exactly as recited herein and, after Closing, Owner will have no further interest (including but not limited to rights of redemption or statutory lien rights) or claims in or to the Property or to the rents, proceeds or profits that may be derived from the Property, of any kind whatsoever.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>No Merger</U>.  Notwithstanding Transferee's acquisition of the Property, the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the other Loan Documents will not be cancelled, will survive the Closing and delivery of any deeds and/or releases in connection with the Closing, and all of the Financing Documents will remain in full force and effect after the transaction contemplated by this Agreement has been consummated, except as otherwise provided in the Collateral Disposition Agreement.  The Parties further agree that the interest of Transferee in the Property after Transferee's acquisition of the Property will not merge with any interest of Agent or Lenders in the Property under the Financing Documents.  It is the express intention of each of the Parties that such interests of Transferee on the one hand and of Agent and Lenders on the other in the Property will not merge, but will be and remain at all times separate and distinct, notwithstanding any union of those interests in any one or more of the Lender-Related
 Parties at any time by purchase, termination or otherwise and that the lien of the Mortgage and the other Security Documents in the Property will be and remain at all times a valid and continuous lien on the Property unless and until released of record by, as applicable, Agent, Lenders or their respective successors or assigns.</p>

<b>Section 2.3.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B><U>Records and Budgets</B></U>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lessee shall keep or cause to be kept at the Records Office suitable books of control and account as provided in this Agreement.  Lessee has previously prepared and submitted to Owner an annual operating budget and an annual capital budget for the Property for the year ending December 31, 2002, which Owner has reviewed and approved and which shall constitute the Approved Operating Budget (as hereinafter defined) and the Approved Capital Budget (as hereinafter defined) for such year.  The Approved Operating Budget for the year ended December 31, 2002 is attached as <U>Exhibit B</U> to this Agreement and the Approved Capital Budget for such year is attached as <U>Exhibit C</U> to this Agreement.  For each year thereafter during the Term, Lessee shall prepare and submit to Owner a proposed annual operating budget and a proposed annual capital budget for the management and operation of the Property pursuant to this Agreement no later than December 1 of each year during the Term for the following calendar year.  
The proposed annual operating and capital budgets shall be in a form consistent with prior budgets delivered by Lessee to Owner or Owner's Affiliates. Lessee covenants that the proposed budgets as submitted shall include only expenses which Lessee reasonably believes are necessary to enable Lessee to operate the Property in compliance with the Management Standard and Applicable Laws.  Owner shall review the proposed budgets, shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to same and Lessee and Owner shall work together in good faith to resolve any questions raised by Owner promptly.  From and after the time at which Owner grants its written consent to such budgets they shall be deemed to be the &quot;Approved Operating Budget&quot; and the &quot;Approved Capital Budget,&quot; and collectively the &quot;Approved Budgets,&quot; subject to the variance procedures provided for herein.  The parties intend that an Approved Operating Budget and an Approved Capital Budget for each calendar year shall be in place for th
e Property by January 31 of each year during the Term. </p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the event an annual operating budget for the Property has not been approved by Owner prior to January 31 for any calendar year during the Term, the operating budget for each calendar month (&quot;Current Month&quot;) until the annual operating budget for that year is approved shall be the amount budgeted for the last calendar month of the most recent Approved Operating Budget for the Property (&quot;Base Month&quot;), as adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease between the Base Month and the Current Month in the Consumer Price Index published monthly by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics for the metropolitan area closest to the Property, and Lessee shall provide a copy of such index to Owner upon request.  Lessee shall submit such adjusted monthly operating budget to Owner for review not more than ten days before the first day of the month for which it is proposed, and such budget, after written approval by Owner and until a new annual operating budget is approved pursua
nt to the terms hereof, shall be deemed an &quot;Approved Operating Budget&quot; for purposes of this Agreement.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lessee shall not exceed the amount of any item or items shown on the Approved Capital Budget by more than an aggregate of $35,000 per annum or the amount of any item or items shown on the Approved Operating Budget by more than 5% per annum for any single line item or 2% of the aggregate Approved Operating Budget without explicit advance written authorization from Owner (other than any expenditure reasonably and necessarily incurred by Lessee in an Emergency during which Lessee is unable to contact Owner for authorization; provided, however, that Owner shall be informed of any such expenditures and the reasons therefor immediately and in no event later than the end of the second business day immediately following the Emergency).  The variance of $35,000 per annum for the Approved Capital Budget is hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Permitted Capital Variance,&quot; the variance of 5% per line item (subject to a limit of 2% of the aggregate Approved Operating Budget) for the Approved Operating Budget is here
in referred to as the &quot;Permitted Operating Variance&quot; and the Permitted Capital Variance and the Permitted Operating Variance are herein collectively referred to as the &quot;Permitted Variances.&quot;  Subject to the Permitted Variances, Lessee shall (a) use reasonable efforts to ensure that the actual cost of maintaining and operating the Property will not exceed the Approved Operating Budget, (b) obtain Owner's prior written approval for any expenditure exceeding the Approved Operating Budget or the Approved Capital Budget, as applicable, other than the Permitted Variances and (c) diligently seek to minimize the cost of overtime labor consistent with maintaining and operating the Property in accordance with the Management Standard and Applicable Laws.  Lessee shall obtain and credit to Owner all discounts, rebates or commissions obtainable with respect to purchases, contracts, maintenance and repair work or other transactions made on Owner's behalf consistent with maintaining and operating the Pr
operty in accordance with the Management Standard and Applicable Laws.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An Approved Operating Budget shall constitute an authorization for Lessee to expend money to operate and manage the Property to the extent consistent therewith without further approval.  Lessee shall not without prior written consent of Owner incur any expenses in the operation or maintenance of the Property which would exceed in aggregate, during the period covered by such Approved Operating Budget, the annual amount budgeted for such expenses, except with respect to the Permitted Operating Variance as provided in subsection (c) above.  Lessee shall provide Owner with quarterly reports reflecting Lessee's compliance with subsection (c) and this subsection (d).  Whenever the total budgeted amount is (or appears likely to be) exceeded by more than the Permitted Variances, a cumulative budget variance in excess of the Permitted Operating Variance and a revised operating budget shall be presented to Owner for its approval.  Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Lessee may not act outside of the exist
ing Approved Operating Budget and Permitted Operating Variance until the revised operating budget is approved in writing by Owner, whereupon such revised operating budget shall become the Approved Operating Budget.  Once approved, Lessee's authority with respect to the revised or any additionally revised budget is the same as Lessee's authority for the original Approved Operating Budget.  Lessee shall not be deemed to be in breach or violation of this Agreement on account of any amounts expended by Lessee at Owner's specific written request for purposes not included in any Approved Budget.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Owner shall fund any operating deficit shown in the Approved Operating Budget; provided, however, that Lessee shall be liable to pay for any deficit arising from matters for which Lessee has an indemnity obligation under Section 8.1.1.  Owner shall not unreasonably withhold any consent, approval or authorization that is required of Owner under this Agreement.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Approved Capital Budget shall not constitute an authorization for Lessee to expend any money other than an expenditure for an individual capital improvement included in, and made during the period covered by, such Approved Capital Budget other than expenditures which fall within the Permitted Capital Variance.  Any other capital expenditure must be specifically authorized in writing by Owner in advance.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Except to the extent that Lessee provides to Owner documentary evidence that Lessee is unable to reasonably obtain three (3) bids, or unless Owner specifically waives such requirements, either by memorandum or as an amendment to this Agreement, all new or replacement capital items exceeding $35,000 shall be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding, solicited in the following manner:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Owner shall be free to accept or reject any and all bids. Owner will communicate to Lessee in writing its acceptance or rejection of bids within seven (7) days after Lessee's submission thereof to Owner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Lessee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to identify and collect all amounts owing from Residents under the Residency Agreements (collectively, &quot;Rent Income&quot;) and all Other Income.  Lessee shall deposit or cause to be deposited all Rent Income and Other Income directly into the &quot;Rent Account&quot; described in Article 7 below.  At all times that Lessee holds any Rent Income or Other Income, Lessee shall hold such funds in trust for Owner until deposited into the Rent Account.

Lessee shall give Owner notice if the funds deposited in Lessee's general accounts for any month pursuant to the procedure described above will not be sufficient to pay the Expense Reimbursement Amounts for such month in accordance with the Approved Operating Budget and the Approved Capital Budget and Owner may cause to be deposited in Lessee's general accounts additional amounts to cover such shortfall; provided, however, that Lessee shall not be required to pay Expense Reimbursement Amounts from its own funds if the deposits by Owner pursuant to this Section 7.2.1 are not sufficient for such purpose.</p>

Lessee acknowledges and agrees (after consultation with its counsel) that, if Lessee becomes the debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, (i) the funds to be transferred pursuant to Section 7.2.1(d) are not property of Lessee and will not at any time be property of its bankruptcy estate; and (ii) Owner's exercise of its right to change the amount of, or terminate, the transfers of funds provided for in Section 7.2.1(d) are not subject to the automatic stay of Bankruptcy Code Section 362 and Lessee forever waives any contention to the contrary.</p>

Owner may assign this Agreement to any person to whom Owner conveys the Property and upon such assignment Owner shall be released from all obligations accruing under this Agreement after the date of such Assignment.

<B><U>No Waiver</B></U>.

Owner shall have the right, from time to time, to designate to Lessee, in writing, a person or firm who shall have the right to grant consents and approvals, sign contracts, receive reports and notices, and otherwise act in the place and stead of Owner for all purposes under this Agreement. Lessee shall have the right to rely upon, and the duty to honor, such designation until the same is revoked in writing by Owner and delivered to Lessee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Waiver and Release of Released Borrowing Parties</U>.  Subject to the exclusions expressly set forth below, Agent and Lenders hereby release Borrowers, Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, agents, contractors, consultants, employees, servants, attorneys, representatives, officers, trustees, beneficiaries and directors, as well as the respective heirs, successors, legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any and all of them (herein collectively referred to as the &quot;Released Borrowing Parties&quot;) as follows:  (i) for Borrowers and Guarantor, from all recourse personal and corporate liability in the amount of the sum of (A) $_____________, which represents the Allocated Principal Release Amount applicable to the __________Property plus the Applicable Percentage for such Property of interest accrued to the date hereof under the Financing Documents, and (B) the Applicable Percentage for such Property of the aggregate Non-Principal Amounts, other tha
n interest, outstanding as of the date hereof under the Financing Documents, which amount, collectively, equals the Allocated Deficiency Waiver Amount for such Property; and (ii) for all Released Borrowing Parties other than Borrowers and Guarantor, from all liability (including without limitation personal or corporate, recourse, nonrecourse or otherwise) in the amount of the Allocated Deficiency Waiver Amount for such Property.  In each case such releases are releases to the extent described above under the Financing Documents in the amount of the Allocated Deficiency Waiver Amount applicable to the Property for which Borrowers and Guarantor <B>[delivered the Transfer Deed referenced in Subsection 2, above]</B> and Agent and Lenders hereby waive any and all rights to make demand for, or receive payment of, the amount so released, to the extent of such release.  Such release is effective as of the Recordation Date for such Property.  Agent and Lenders agree, upon the request of Borrowers and Guarantor, to pr
ovide a calculation of the amount the Non-Principal Amounts, other than interest, that have been released under this Agreement and under any other Interim Deficiency Waivers or the Final Interim Deficiency Waiver that may have been delivered prior to the date of such request pursuant to the Collateral Disposition Agreement.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Exclusions from Release</U>.  The foregoing releases and waivers shall only release Borrowers and Guarantor from recourse personal and corporate liability for the amounts so released but shall release the Released Borrowing Parties other than Borrowers and Guarantor completely for the amounts so released.  The nonrecourse obligation of Borrowers and Guarantor for such amounts secured by the Security Documents shall remain in full force and effect on a nonrecourse basis except as the same may be reduced by application of the proceeds of foreclosure sales or other sales of Collateral actually received by Agent or Lenders.  As used in this Agreement, &quot;nonrecourse&quot; means that Borrowers' and Guarantor's obligations and the claims against Borrowers and Guarantor are limited solely to Borrowers' and Guarantor's interest in the Collateral, and no in personam suit to enforce such obligations or in personam judgment may be sought or obtained against Borrowers or Guarantor for such obligations.  Nothing co
ntained in this Agreement will result in the release by Agent or Lenders of any Collateral for the Credit Facility.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Revival of Obligations</U>.  To the extent any payment made or property transferred to Agent, any Lender, any Transferee or any third party by a Borrower or Guarantor or pursuant to a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale is invalidated, declared to be a preference or fraudulent transfer, set aside or required to be repaid under any bankruptcy law, other law or equitable principle, the obligations of Borrowers and Guarantor for repayment of such amounts (together with interest thereon as provided in the Financing Documents) will be revived and continue as if such payment or transfer had never been made by the applicable Borrower or Guarantor and notwithstanding any release of liability otherwise provided for in this Agreement.</LI>

7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Full Force and Effect</U>.The provisions of each Financing Document, as modified by this Agreement and the Collateral Disposition Agreement, and the Collateral Disposition Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and Borrowers and Guarantor ratify and confirm their obligations under the Financing Documents as modified by this Agreement and the Collateral Disposition Agreement and the Collateral Disposition Agreement in all respects.  No failure or delay by Agent, Lenders or Transferee in exercising any power or right under this Agreement or any Financing Document will operate as a waiver of such power or right, nor will any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or future exercise of such power or right, or the exercise of any other power or right.  Borrowers and Guarantor acknowledge and agree that there are no defenses, counterclaims or setoffs against any of their obligations under the Financing Documents.  In the event of any incons
istency between the terms of this Agreement and those of the Collateral Disposition Agreement, the terms of the Collateral Disposition Agreement will control.

A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Borrowers, Agent and Lenders are parties to

Lenders are parties to an Agency Agreement dated as of February 12, 1999 (as
amended to the date hereof, the "Agency Agreement"), as amended by a First
Amendment to Agency Agreement dated as of October 29, 1999.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit
Facility provided for in the Financing Agreement (the "Credit Facility") is
evidenced by the following (collectively, as amended to the date hereof, the
"Notes"): (i) a Promissory Note dated September 28, 1998 in the principal amount
of $45,000,000 in favor of Bank United as a Lender, as amended by a First
Amendment to Promissory Note dated as of November 18, 1998; (ii) a Promissory

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor has guaranteed the Credit Facility
provided for in the Financing Agreement pursuant to the terms of the following
(collectively, the "Guaranty"): (i)&nbsp;the Guaranty of Payment Agreement dated
September 28, 1998 executed by Guarantor in favor of Agent and Lenders, as

October 29, 1999, a Suspension, Waiver and Modification Agreement dated as of

of May 31, 2000; and (ii) certain Guaranties of Performance executed by
Guarantor on various dates in connection with individual Properties.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Financing Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranty, the Agency Agreement, the Security
Documents, and all other documents, instruments and agreements evidencing,
securing or otherwise relating to the Credit Facility are collectively referred
to as the "Financing Documents."
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Borrowers, Guarantor, Lenders and Agent are parties to that certain Forbearance
and Collateral Account Agreement dated as of November 1, 2001 (as amended to the
date hereof, the "Forbearance Agreement") pursuant to which Agent and Lenders
agreed to forbear for a limited time in the exercise of certain rights and
remedies provided to Agent and Lenders under the Financing Documents on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Forbearance Agreement.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowers
and Guarantor are in default under the Financing Documents by virtue, without
limitation, of the failure to make payments when due under the Financing
Documents (the "Maturity Default").
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to that certain Collateral Disposition Agreement dated October 8, 2002, (the
"Collateral Disposition Agreement"), Borrowers, Guarantor, Lenders and Agent
agreed that Borrowers and Guarantor would refinance certain of the Properties
and that Borrowers and Guarantor would permit Agent, on behalf of Lenders, to
foreclose Lenders' interests in the Properties and the other Collateral with the
cooperation of Borrowers and Guarantor or, alternatively at the option of Agent,
would provide Agent or any one or more nominees of Agent with deeds in lieu of
foreclosure with respect to some or all of the Properties and the other
Collateral, and Agent and Lenders would release Borrowers and Guarantor, prior
to the Final Interim Deficiency Waiver Date, from recourse liability for the
Allocated Deficiency Waiver Amount applicable to each Property, as and when each
such refinancing or foreclosure occurs or such deed in lieu is recorded or,
subject to the prior approval of Agent and Lenders pursuant to the Collateral
Disposition Agreement, such Property is sold.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Collateral Disposition Agreement, Borrowers, Guarantor, Lenders and Agent
agreed that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Collateral
Disposition Agreement, on the Final Interim Deficiency Waiver Date, Agent and
Lenders would deliver this Agreement.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration
of the foregoing, the sum of Ten and No/100 Dollars and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereby agree as follows:
<P></P><BR><BR>
<CENTER>-2- </CENTER>
<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Defined Terms</U>. All terms as defined herein shall have the same meanings
as set forth in the Collateral Disposition Agreement.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Acknowledgement of Final Interim Deficiency Waiver Date</U>. Agent, Lenders,
Borrowers and Guarantor hereby acknowledge that the date of execution and
delivery of this Agreement is the Final Interim Deficiency Waiver Date.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver
and Release of Released Borrowing Parties</U>. Subject to the exclusions
expressly set forth below, Agent and Lenders hereby release Borrowers, Guarantor
and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, agents, contractors, consultants,
employees, servants, attorneys, representatives, officers, trustees,
beneficiaries and directors, as well as the respective heirs, successors, legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of any and
all of them (herein collectively referred to as the "Released Borrowing
Parties") as follows: (i) for Borrowers and Guarantor, from all recourse
personal and corporate liability for all amounts owing under the Financing
Documents other than the sum of Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00)
(such amount, as defined herein and in the Collateral Disposition Agreement, the
"Residual Deficiency Amount"); and (ii) for all Released Borrowing Parties other
than Borrowers and Guarantor, from all liability (including without limitation
personal or corporate, recourse, nonrecourse or otherwise) for all amounts owing
under the Financing Documents other than the Residual Deficiency Amount. In each
case such releases are releases to the extent described above under the
Financing Documents for all amounts other than the Residual Deficiency Amount
and Agent and Lenders hereby waive any and all rights to make demand for, or
receive payment of, the amount so released, to the extent of such release. Such
release is effective as of the Final Interim Deficiency Waiver Date.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Exclusions from Release</U>. The foregoing releases and waivers shall only
release Borrowers and Guarantor from recourse personal and corporate liability
for the amounts so released but shall release the Released Borrowing Parties
other than Borrowers and Guarantor completely for the amounts so released. The
nonrecourse obligation of Borrowers and Guarantor for such amounts secured by
the Security Documents shall remain in full force and effect on a nonrecourse
basis except as the same may be reduced by application of the proceeds of
foreclosure sales or other sales of Collateral actually received by Agent or
Lenders. As used in this Agreement, "nonrecourse" means that Borrowers' and
Guarantor's obligations and the claims against Borrowers and Guarantor are
limited solely to Borrowers' and Guarantor's interest in the Collateral, and no
in personam suit to enforce such obligations or in personam judgment may be
sought or obtained against Borrowers or Guarantor for such obligations. Nothing
contained in this Agreement will result in the release by Agent or Lenders of
any Collateral for the Credit Facility.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Revival of Obligations</U>. To the extent any payment made or property
transferred to Agent, any Lender, any Transferee or any third party by a
Borrower or Guarantor or pursuant to a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale
is invalidated, declared to be a preference or fraudulent transfer, set aside or
required to be repaid under any bankruptcy law, other law or equitable
principle, the obligations of Borrowers and Guarantor for repayment of such
amounts (together with interest thereon as provided in the Financing Documents)
will be revived and continue as if such payment or transfer had never been made
by the applicable Borrower or Guarantor and notwithstanding any release of
liability otherwise provided for in this Agreement. <BR><BR>
<CENTER>-3- </CENTER>
<HR 4>
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Preservation of Liability for Certain Matters</U>. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the foregoing releases and waivers shall not
result in the release of any obligation or liability of Borrowers or Guarantor
for (a) fraud; (b) liability under any Environmental Indemnity Agreement entered
into by Borrowers and Guarantor in connection with any Property; (c) avoidance
of any Transfer Deed as a fraudulent transfer, preference or otherwise; (d)
recovery from Agent, any Lender or Transferee of payments made pursuant to any
Medicare or Medicaid program with respect to any Property prior to the
Recordation Date for such Property or otherwise as a result of actions of a
Borrower or Guarantor; or (e) material losses resulting from the material
untruth of any representation or warranty contained in the Collateral
Disposition Agreement or from the failure of Borrowers or Guarantor to perform
any covenant or agreement made by them in the Collateral Disposition Agreement,
the Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreement, or in any Deed in Lieu, which failure
is not cured pursuant to Section 9.5 of the Collateral Disposition Agreement.

<U>Miscellaneous</U>.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notices</U>. All notices, requests, demands

Collateral Disposition Agreement.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Jury Trial Waiver</U>. BY EXECUTING THIS
AGREEMENT, AGENT, LENDERS, BORROWERS AND GUARANTOR EACH IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY FINANCING DOCUMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE FINANCING DOCUMENTS, THE COLLATERAL
DISPOSITION AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(ORAL OR WRITTEN), OR ACTIONS OF AGENT, LENDERS, GUARANTOR OR BORROWERS. THIS
PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR BORROWERS, GUARANTOR, LENDERS AND AGENT

7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Full Force and Effect</U>.The provisions of
each Financing Document, as modified by this Agreement and the Collateral
Disposition Agreement, and the Collateral Disposition Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect, and Borrowers and Guarantor ratify and confirm their
obligations under the Financing Documents as modified by this Agreement and the
Collateral Disposition Agreement and the Collateral Disposition Agreement in all
respects. No failure or delay by Agent, Lenders or Transferee in exercising any
power or right under this Agreement or any Financing Document will operate as a
waiver of such power or right, nor will any single or partial exercise of any
power or right preclude any other or future exercise of such power or right, or
the exercise of any other power or right. Borrowers and Guarantor acknowledge
and agree that there are no defenses, counterclaims or setoffs against any of
their obligations under the Financing Documents. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and those of the Collateral
Disposition Agreement, the terms of the Collateral Disposition Agreement will
control.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>No
Novation</U>. This Agreement shall not constitute a novation of any Financing
Document. <BR><BR>

deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, and to do or make, or cause to
be done or made, upon the reasonable request of any other party, any and all

otherwise, as reasonably may be required for the purpose of effecting the terms

<U>Binding Effect</U>. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the

counterparts, all of which together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Relationship Among Parties</U>. Borrowers and Guarantor on the one hand and
Agent, Lenders and Transferee on the other do not now have, nor have they ever
had, any relationship other than that of borrower, guarantor and lender. They
are not now and have not at any time in the past been partners, joint venturers
or part of any other legal relationship except borrower, guarantor and lender
and no other relationship is established by this Agreement or the agreements to
be entered into pursuant to this Agreement. All parties have entered into this
Agreement of their own free will after extensive negotiation and with the advice
of counsel of their own choosing.
<P></P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>No

<P>If the Projects fail to maintain the required Portfolio Debt Coverage Ratio during any Fiscal Quarter, then upon the earlier to occur of (i) five (5) business days of reporting noncompliance, or (ii) five (5) business days written notice to Borrower, Borrower will pay Agent cash in an amount (the "<B>Required Payment Amount</B>") equal, in the case of the first failure, to the <U>lesser</U> of (i) $200,000 or (ii) an amount which, when added to the first number of the debt coverage calculation, would have resulted in the noncomplying debt coverage requirement having been satisfied, and, in the case of the second such failure, to the <U>greater</U> of (x) $200,000 or (y) an amount which, when added to the first number of the debt coverage calculation, would have resulted in the noncomplying debt coverage requirement having been satisfied.  The Required Payment Amount shall be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balances of the Project Loans in the order determined by Agent in its sole discretion.  
If the Projects fail to maintain the required Portfolio Debt Coverage Ratio for more than two (2) Fiscal Quarters, the Required Payment Amount shall equal the Required Principal.  The "<B>Required Principal</B>" is the amount which, when subtracted from the outstanding balance of the Project Loans, would cause the debt service for the Project Loans for the most recent Fiscal Quarter to be reduced to an amount (assuming the Project Loans were reamortized after giving effect to an allocation of the Required Principal to the Project Loans) which would result in the debt coverage requirement for such Fiscal Quarter having been satisfied.  The failure of the Projects to meet the required Portfolio Debt Coverage Ratio, without subsequent and timely payment of the cash necessary to cure the default, shall constitute an immediate Event of Default.</P>
<P></P>
<U><P>Example of Required Principal</U>:  If the outstanding principal balance of the Project Loans is $40,000,000 and the balance needs to be $38,000,000 in order to cause the debt coverage ratio requirement to be satisfied for a particular quarter, then the Required Principal amount is $2,000,000.</P>

<P></P>
<P>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lender may inspect a Project in connection with any Work prior to disbursing funds from the Replacements Reserve Fund with respect thereto.  </P>

Thereafter, the monthly escrow deposit shall be an amount estimated by Lender to be sufficient to pay the next maturing taxes when due, all as more particularly described in Section 2.2(n) of each Mortgage.  In furtherance, but not in limitation, of the requirements of each Mortgage, Borrower shall provide Lender copies of any notices setting forth and/or changing the taxes payable with respect to a Mortgaged Property.  In addition, Borrower shall promptly provide Lender copies of all tax bills when received and make w
ritten request to Lender thirty (30) days prior to the due date for payment of such bills, to the extent of monies escrowed for that purpose.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrower will cause the Third Party Leases to be terminated and deliver Lender  evidence of such termination on or before December 31, 2002, failing which, until the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;July 1, 2004 or (ii) the date evidence of such termination is delivered to Lender, the defined term "<B>Commercial Based Rate</B>" as used in the Master Loan Agreement shall have the following meaning:  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<B>Commercial Based Rate</B>" means two and one-quarter percent (2.25%) per annum in excess of the Base Rate, it being agreed that the Commercial Based Rate may increase or decrease, as the case may be, from time to time as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate.  In no event shall the Commercial Based Rate be less than seven and one-quarter percent (7.25%).</P>
<P></P>
<P>The failure of Borrower to deliver such evidence on or before July 1, 2004 shall constitute an immediate Event of Default.  Any monies paid to the Lessees under the Third Party Leases to terminate the Third Party Leases shall not be included as expenses when calculating Cash Flow or Net Operating Income.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the Third Party Leases, Borrower shall enter into a Management Agreement with Alterra with respect to each Leased Mortgaged Property in the form of the Management Agreements executed by Borrower and Alterra on the date of this Agreement.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 14 of this Agreement, prior to the date the Third Party Leases are terminated, Lender shall only have a security interest in those monies in the Restricted Account pertaining to the Leased Mortgaged Properties to which either Borrower or Alterra is entitled.  Any monies in the Restricted Account pertaining to the Leased Mortgaged Properties to which neither Borrower nor Alterra is entitled shall nevertheless be included as income of the Leased Mortgaged Properties for purposes of calculating Cash Flow.</P>
<P></P>
<P><LI><U>Management Agreements</U>.  Borrower and Alterra acknowledge and agree that the Management Agreements between the two parties of even date herewith with respect to each of the Mortgaged Properties (other than Austintown Mortgaged Property, Richmond Mortgaged Property and Portage Mortgaged Property) constitute Operating Agreements and Management Contracts.</LI></P>
<P></P>
<P><LI><U>Financing Statements</U>.  Borrower and Alterra hereby authorize Lender to file any financing statement or financing statement amendment covering the Collateral or relating to the security interest created therein.</LI></P>

Alterra agrees to indemnify and hold Lender harmless against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (including without limitation attorneys' fees) incurred as a result of any representation or warranty made by it herein proving to be untrue in any respect.</LI></P>

Prior to the Confirmation Date, Lender will not declare an Event of Default as the result, after the date hereof, of Alterra's failure generally to pay (or admi

<P></P>
<P><LI><U>Title Endorsements</U>.

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE FORBEARANCE OF LENDER IN EXERCISING ITS REMEDIES UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE MODIFICATION OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, BORROWER HEREBY AGREES THAT, IN THE EVENT BORROWER FILES A PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY CODE OR ANY OTHER PRESENT OR FUTURE FEDERAL OR STATE INSOLVENCY, BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR LAW (ALL OF THE FOREGOING HEREINAFTER COLLECTIVELY CALLED "<B>APPLICABLE BANKRUPTCY LAW</B>") OR AN INVOLUNTARY PETITION FOR RELIEF IS FILED AGAINST BORROWER UNDER ANY APPLICABLE BANKRUPTCY LAW, OR AN ORDER FOR RELIEF NAMING BORROWER IS ENTERED UNDER ANY APPLICABLE BANKRUPTCY LAW, OR ANY COMPOSITION, REARRANGEMENT, EXTENSION, REORGANIZATION OR OTHER RELIEF OF DEBTORS NOW OR HEREAFTER EXISTING IS REQUESTED OR CONSENTED TO BY BORROWER, THEN LENDER SHALL THEREUPON BE ENTITLED TO IMMEDIATE AND ABSOLUTE RELIEF FROM ANY AUTOMATIC STAY IMPOSED BY SECTION 362 OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY CODE, OR ANY OTHE
R APPLICABLE BANKRUPTCY LAW, ON OR AGAINST THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO LENDER UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FORECLOSURE) AND/OR AT LAW OR EQUITY, AND BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO OBJECT TO SUCH RELIEF FROM AUTOMATIC STAY AND AGREES NOT TO OPPOSE LENDER'S MOTION TO OBTAIN SUCH RELIEF, AND FURTHER AGREES THAT THE ABOVE AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES "CAUSE" TO LIFT THE AUTOMATIC STAY PURSUANT TO SECTION 362(D) OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH ARE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF LENDER'S CONSIDERATION FOR ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Master Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the filing of a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding by Alterra (the "<B>Alterra Bankruptcy</B>") shall not constitute an Event of Default, except in the event of a Bankruptcy Default.  As used herein, the term "<B>Bankruptcy Default</B>" means the occurrence of one or more of the following:</P>
<P></P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any plan of reorganization is filed by any party in the Alterra Bankruptcy which is not in violation of Alterra's right to exclusivity under Bankruptcy Code&#167;1121 and applicable rules and which proposes to (i) treat Lender in a manner different than that set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or (ii) change in any respect the collateral for the Project Loans or any of Lender's rights with respect to the Collateral (regardless of whether such proposed plan, motion or other court action is successful).  For purposes of this paragraph, different treatment includes, without limitation, changing the term, the interest rate or the amortization of the Notes, regardless of whether the proposed different treatment is economically material to Lender.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any lawsuit, proceeding, cause of action, or adversary proceeding is filed by any party in interest in the Alterra Bankruptcy against Lender under any legal theory, including without limitation, any causes of action under Chapter 5 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and not dismissed within 45 days after the filing thereof.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Alterra's exclusive right in which to file and seek confirmation of a plan of reorganization under Section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code is terminated.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the above, Lender may file a claim against Alterra (in its capacity as guarantor of the Project Loans) in the Alterra Bankruptcy.  Nothing herein prevents Lender from pursuing its claim against Alterra in the Alterra Bankruptcy.</P>
<P></P>
<P><LI><U>No Waiver</U>.  Lender in the past may have accepted, without exercising the remedies to which Lender was entitled, payments and performance by Borrower that constituted defaults under the Loan Documents.  Alterra and Borrower acknowledge that no such acceptance or grace granted by Lender in the past, or Lender's agreement to the modifications evidenced hereby, has in any manner diminished Lender's right in the future to insist that Alterra and Borrower strictly comply with the terms of the Loan Documents, as modified by the terms hereof.  Furthermore, Alterra and Borrower specifically acknowledge that any future grace or forgiveness of default by Lender shall not constitute a waiver or diminishment of any right of Lender with respect to any future default of Alterra or Borrower, whether or not similar to any default with respect to which Lender has in the past chosen, or may in the future choose, not to exercise all of the rights and remedies granted to it under the Loan Documents.</LI></P>
