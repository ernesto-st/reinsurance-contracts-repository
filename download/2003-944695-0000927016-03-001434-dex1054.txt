Servicing Agreement (defined below) to perform some or all administrative
services; and

on the Effective Date, a final statement of the Business as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and a Final Closing Financial Statement for the
period from the Effective Date through the Closing Date, (the "Final Statement,"
"Final Closing Statement" and "Final Closing Financial Statement",
respectively). In the event that Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree on
the manner in which any item or items should be treated in the preparation of
the Final Statement, Final Closing Statement or Final Closing Financial
Statement within such 90-day period, separate written reports of such item or
items shall be made in concise form and shall be referred to KPMG, LLP (the
"Third Party Adjudicator") within seven days following the 90 day period. The
Third Party Adjudicator shall determine within 14 days the manner in which such
item or items shall be treated on the Final Statement, Final Closing Statement
or Final Closing Financial Statement; provided, however, that the dollar amount
of each item in dispute shall be determined within the range of dollar amounts
proposed by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser on the other hand. The
determinations by the Third Party Adjudicator as to the items in dispute shall
be in writing and shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be so
reflected in the Final Statement, Final Closing Statement or Final Closing
Financial Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Third Party
Adjudicator shall be shared equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand. Following the resolution of all disputed items (or, if there
is no dispute, promptly after the parties reach agreement on the Final
Statement, Final Closing Statement and/or Final Closing Financial Statement),
Sellers shall prepare the Final Statement, Final Closing Statement and/or Final
Closing Financial Statement and shall deliver copies of such statements and/or
such financial statement to Purchaser.

         (b) In the event the amount of Effective Date Reserves less the Ceding
Commission is less than the General Account Reserves as of the Effective Date
(as reported in the Final Statement) less the Adjusted Ceding Commission,
Sellers shall, within ten (10) Business Days of agreement upon the Final
Statement, transfer to Purchaser additional cash or cash equivalents equal to
the amount of such difference less 2% of the Effective Date Reserves, together
with interest thereon from and including the Effective Date, to but not
including the date of such transfer, computed at the Three Month LIBOR as of
5:00 p.m. on the Effective Date. In the event that the full 2% of the Effective
Date Reserves is not applied to such payment the balance shall be paid by

Three Month LIBOR as of 5:00 p.m. on the Effective Date.

         (c) In the event the amount of Effective Date Reserves less the Ceding
Commission is greater than General Account Reserves as of the Effective Date (as
reported in the Final Statement) less the Final Ceding Commission, Purchaser
shall, within ten (10) Business Days of agreement upon the Final Statement,
transfer to Sellers cash or cash equivalents equal to the amount of such
difference plus 2% of the Effective Date Reserves, together with interest
thereon from and including the Effective Date, to but not including the date of
such transfer, computed at the Three Month LIBOR as of 5:00 p.m. on the
Effective Date.

         (d) In the event that the aggregate balance shown on the Final Closing
Financial Statement is greater than or less than the Estimated Notional Account
Balance, such difference together with interest thereon from and including the
Effective Date, to but not including the date of such transfer, computed at the
Three Month LIBOR as of 5:00 p.m. on the Effective Date shall be paid in
immediately available funds to the appropriate party within ten (10) Business
Days of the agreement upon the Final Closing Financial Statement.

         (e) In the event that the General Account Reserves as of the Closing
Date as shown on the Closing Date Statement is greater than or less than the
General Account Reserves as of the Closing Date as shown on the Final Closing
Statement and such difference would have resulted in a change to the Ceding
Commission in accordance with the definition thereof, 50% of such difference
together with interest thereon from and including the Closing Date, but not
including the date of such transfer, computed at the Three Month LIBOR as of
5:00 p.m. EST on the Effective Date shall be paid in immediately available funds
to the appropriate party within ten (10) Business Days of agreement upon the
Final Closing Statement.

         (f) In the event that Purchaser is no longer required to maintain or is
able to reduce the amount of the Interest Maintenance Reserve from the level
reflected in the Final Statement, then Purchaser shall within ten (10) Business
Days of such determination transfer to Sellers cash or cash equivalents in the
amount of such Interest Maintenance Reserve or such reduction, as relevant,
multiplied by 0.24. promptly following the time of such determination. The
parties recognize that Sellers intend to reflect the release of any portion of
the Interest Maintenance Reserve in its statutory accounting statements.

         (g) Amounts required to be transferred from Purchaser to Sellers or
from Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to this Section shall be netted against one
another so that only a single net transfer shall be required. Any transfer of
cash required under this Section 2.04 shall be made

       Section 3.10  Coinsured Contracts.

       (a)    All Coinsured Contracts as now in force are in all respects, to
the extent required under Applicable Law, on forms approved by applicable
insurance regulatory authorities or which have been filed and not objected to by
such authorities within the period provided for objection, and such forms comply
in all material respects with the insurance statutes, regulations and rules
applicable thereto, except where the failure to have such approval or
non-objection or the failure to so comply would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Business. To the knowledge of
the Seller Key People, at the time any Seller paid commissions to any broker or
agent within the past 36 months in connection with the sale of Coinsured
Contracts, each such broker or agent was duly licensed as an insurance broker
(for the type of business sold by such broker) or agent in the particular
jurisdiction in which such broker or agent sold such business for any Seller,
and no such broker or agent violated (or with or without notice or lapse of time
or both would have violated) any federal, state, local or foreign law, ordinance
or regulation or any other requirement of any governmental or regulatory body,
court or arbitrator applicable to the Business, except where the failure to be
so licensed or any such violation would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the Business. Neither the manner in which any
Seller compensates any Person involved in the sale or servicing of Coinsured
Contracts that is not registered as a broker-dealer or insurance agent, as
applicable, nor, to the knowledge of the Seller Key People, the conduct of any
such Person, renders such Person a broker-dealer or insurance agent under any
applicable federal or state law, and the manner in which any Seller compensates
each Person involved in the sale or servicing of Coinsured Contracts is in
compliance with all applicable federal or state laws except where such manner of
compensation or conduct having such affect or the failure to be so in compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse affect on
the Business.

       (b)    Both Sellers have implemented procedures and programs which are
reasonably designed to provide assurance that its respective agents and
employees are in material compliance with all Applicable Law, including without
limitation, advertising, licensing and sales practices laws, regulations,
directives, bulletins and opinions of governmental authorities, except for
non-compliances that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not have a material adverse effect on the Business. Except as previously
disclosed in this Agreement or any Schedule to this Agreement, the Seller Key
People have no knowledge of any noncompliance with the procedures and programs
implemented, except for noncompliance which, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not have a material adverse effect on the Business.

       (c)    Sellers have at all times since January 1, 1993, maintained
records which in all material respects accurately reflect transactions in
reasonable detail, and accounting controls, policies and procedures sufficient
to ensure in all material respects that such transactions are recorded in a
manner which permits the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP and applicable statutory accounting requirements.

       Section 3.11  Regulatory Filings. Except as listed on Schedule 3.11
hereto, since January 1, 1996, Sellers have filed all reports, statements,
documents, registrations, filings or

                                       20

<PAGE>

submissions (including without limitation any sales material) required to be
filed by Sellers, with any governmental or regulatory body to the extent they
relate to the Business, except where the failure to make such filings would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
Business. Except as listed on Schedule 3.11 hereto, all such registrations,
filings and submissions were in compliance in all material respects with
applicable law when filed or as amended or supplemented, and, to the knowledge
of the Seller Key People, no material deficiencies have been asserted by any
such governmental or regulatory body with respect to such registrations, filings
or submissions that have not been satisfied.

       Section 3.12  Reinsurance. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12 hereto,
and to the knowledge of the Seller Key People, (a) there are no agreements,
written or oral, pursuant to which Sellers cede or retrocede risks assumed under
the Coinsured Contracts and (b) there are no Coinsured Contracts which are
agreements of assumed reinsurance.

       Section 3.13  Conduct of Business. Except as expressly contemplated or
required by this Agreement, or as set forth in Schedule 3.13 hereto, since
December 31, 2001, Sellers have generally conducted the Business only in the
ordinary course consistent with their past practices and there has not been any
material change in the underwriting, pricing, actuarial, reserving, investment,
sales, marketing or agency practices or policies of the Business, other than a
change that would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
the Business.

       Section 3.14  Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.14, since December 31, 2001, there has been no event or condition, that,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely have a material
adverse effect on the Business.

       Section 3.15  Other Sale Arrangements. None of FAFLIC or AFLIAC is
obligated or liable, contingently or otherwise, for or with respect to
negotiations, letters of intent or commitments for the sale of all or any part
of the Business (except in the ordinary course of business) to any Persons other
than Purchaser.

       Section 3.16  Reserved.

       Section 3.17  Employees. Schedule 3.17(a) hereto lists to the knowledge
of the Seller Key People (i) five Persons employed by any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement who
are key employees for the Business.

       (b) Schedule 3.17(b) hereto lists and describes, to the knowledge of the
Seller Key People, any "pay to stay" or similar arrangement applicable to any
employee listed on Schedule 3.17(a) hereto as of the date of this Agreement.

       Section 3.18  Transferred Assets. Sellers have good and marketable title
to all assets included within the Transferred Assets (other than cash and the
Transferred Contracts), free of any lien, encumbrance, restriction, claim,
charge, or defect of title, except for any liens, encumbrances, restrictions,
claims, charges or defaults of title (i) whose effect on the value of the
relevant Transferred Assets will be collectively reflected in the current value
thereof on the Final Balance Sheet, (ii) identified on Schedule 3.18 hereto, or
(iii) with respect to assets other than cash or Investment Assets, that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
the Business.

       Section 3.21  Tax Matters. Except as described on Schedule 3.21:

       (a)    Sellers agree that for all Tax purposes the transactions pursuant

accept certain confidentiality and other non-financial obligations imposed on
Sellers under the license agreements relating to such software. Purchaser shall
be entitled to participate fully in any negotiation with any such licensors, but
shall bear its own costs in connection with such participation.

     (b) Sellers shall, commencing on the date hereof and continuing through the
end of the term of the Transition Servicing Agreement:

                                       32

<PAGE>

     (i)   provide Purchaser with access to employees, agents and independent
     contractors of Sellers reasonably specified by Purchaser to understand any
     and all aspects of the Business and to plan the transition of the Business;
     including but not limited to subject matter experts to support the
     definition of interfaces to Purchaser's administrative systems from
     Seller's administrative systems;

     (ii)  designate certain individuals (subject to Purchaser's reasonable
     approval) to serve as members of a Seller/Purchaser transition team and
     cause such individuals to devote reasonable time to transition matters;

     (iii) devote reasonable resources to transition matters (such resources to
     include, without limitation, office accommodations and related facilities
     for a substantial and continuing presence of Purchaser's transition team
     members on any Seller's premises);

     (iv)  cooperate with Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's filing of
     policy and contract forms to enable Purchaser to issue policies and
     contracts substantially similar to those included in the Business;

     (v)   consult with Purchaser regarding Sellers' development work pertaining
     to systems, products, distribution and customer and producer services; and

     (vi)  cooperate with Purchaser in its development work pertaining to
     systems, products, distribution and customer and producer services in order
     to enable implementation of the transition plan at the earliest feasible
     date.

In conjunction with the foregoing, Sellers agree to work with Purchaser to
prepare, and use their best efforts to complete prior to the Closing Date a
transition services work plan detailing the services provided for in this
Section 5.20(b), which work plan will be subject to Purchaser's review and
approval.

     (c)   During the term of the Transition Services Agreement Sellers shall
segment the data associated with the Coinsured Contracts and Sellers and
Purchaser shall test such segmented data to ensure that it can be processed
properly on a stand alone basis, using the Owned Software together with the
Licensed Software. After Purchaser, in its reasonable discretion, is satisfied
with the content and format of the segmented data, Sellers shall deliver such
data to Purchaser in the format and medium identified by Purchaser. All data
delivered to Purchaser hereunder shall be complete and accurate.

     (d)   All of the expenses of Sellers (including both out of pocket fees and
expenses and the costs of use of internal resources of the Sellers and any
Affiliates) in complying with this Section 5.20 and in assisting Purchaser in
the system development activities contemplated under Section 5.22 shall be borne
by Sellers; provided, however, that in the event such expenses exceed $[*],
Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for any amounts in excess of $[*]. Any
reimbursement by Purchaser hereunder shall occur within twenty business days of
Purchaser receiving reasonable documentation of Seller's expenses.

     (e)   Purchaser, at its sole discretion, may choose to forego receiving the
licenses and maintenance provided for in Section 5.20(a) above, and choose
instead to receive the segmented

                                       33

<PAGE>

data provided for in Section 5.20(c) and to process such data using Purchaser's
own systems, or the systems of a third party provider, by providing Sellers with
written notice of such choice. In the event that this option is selected,
Purchaser's costs and expenses (including both out of pocket fees and expenses
and the costs of use of internal resources of Purchaser and any Affiliates)
incurred in processing such data using Purchaser's own systems or the systems of
a third party provider shall be reimbursed by Sellers to the extent that such
costs when added to the other expenses of Sellers in complying with this Section
5.20 and in assisting Purchaser in the system development activities
contemplated under Section 5.22, do not exceed $[*] million in the aggregate.
Any reimbursement by the Sellers hereunder shall occur within twenty business
days of the Sellers receiving reasonable documentation of Purchaser's expenses.

     Section 5.21 Confidentiality. Each party hereto (with Purchaser considered
to be one party and the Sellers considered to be another party for purposes of
this Section 5.21) will hold, and will use its best efforts to cause its
Affiliates, and their respective representatives to hold, in strict confidence
from any Person (other than any such Affiliates or representatives), unless (i)
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process (including without
limitation in connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby of governmental or regulatory
authorities) or by other requirements of law or regulation, or other mandatory
legal process or by the United States National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, (ii) consented to in writing by the other party, (iii) disclosed
in an action or proceeding brought by a party hereto in pursuit of its rights or
in the exercise of its remedies hereunder, (iv) disclosed to any nationally
recognized rating agency by Seller or Purchaser and with Sellers' or Purchaser's
prior consent, or (v) if required by Applicable Law, to correct any material
false or misleading public information concerning the relationship between
Seller and Purchaser, all documents and information concerning the other party
or any of its Affiliates furnished to it by the other party or such other
party's representatives in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, including, without limitation, the Schedules hereto or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent that such documents or
information can be shown to have been (a) previously known or was independently
developed by the receiving party, (b) in the public domain (either prior to or
after the furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no
fault of such receiving party or (c) later acquired by the receiving party from
another source if the receiving party is not aware that such source is under an
obligation to another party hereto to keep such documents and information
confidential; provided that following the Closing the foregoing restrictions
will not apply to Purchaser's use of documents and information concerning the
Business furnished by Sellers hereunder, it being understood that each may,
without prior notification or consent, advise and otherwise hold discussions
with regulators having jurisdiction over each and their respective businesses,
including insurance and securities regulators. In the event the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, upon the request of the other party,
each party hereto will, and will cause its Affiliates and their respective
representatives to promptly redeliver or cause to be redelivered all copies of
confidential documents and information furnished by the other party in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
destroy or cause to be destroyed all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses,
compilations and other writings whatsoever related thereto or based thereon
prepared by the party furnished such documents and information or its
representatives.

     Section 5.22 Systems. During the period prior to the expiration of the
Transition Servicing Agreement, Sellers shall work in good faith to assist
Purchaser in development activities designed to allow that all systems used
principally in the conduct of the Business are capable of inputting, processing
and outputting information in a manner to allow Purchaser to operate the
Business. Each Seller acknowledges the criticality of developing such
capabilities in order to permit Purchaser to commence issuing policies and
contracts substantially identical to the Coinsured Contracts, and thus
maintaining the value of the Business, following the Closing. Purchaser
acknowledges that the development of such capabilities will require resources
that may exceed those reasonably available to Sellers during the pre-Closing
period. In view of the foregoing acknowledgments, each Seller agrees to make
available to Purchaser internal facilities, personnel and other resources for
the development of ongoing operation and transition systems capabilities. On the
date hereof and on the last day of each month prior to Closing, Sellers shall
create a backup tape containing any information regarding the Coinsured
Contracts and deliver such tape to Purchaser within ten business days.

     Section 5.23 Updated Financial Information. As soon as is reasonably
practicable following the end of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of each
Seller, each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser statutory financial statements
with respect to such quarter or year and with respect to the period from the end
of the previous fiscal year to the end of such quarter or year, as applicable.
Sellers agree to file annual statements with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
by February 28, 2003.

     Section 5.24 Reserved.

     Section 5.25 Reinsurance Treaty. In order to effect the assignment of an
Outward Reinsurance Agreement, Sellers and Purchaser hereby agree to cooperate
and use their reasonable best effects to comply with their respective
requirements set out in a letter agreement by and among RGA Reinsurance, AFLIAC
and Purchaser dated December 31, 2002.

     Section 5.26 Forty-Nine State Closing; NY Closing. Notwithstanding Sections
6.03 and 7.03, the parties agree that if on or after January 20, 2003, all of
the conditions to Closing as set forth in Articles VI and VII are satisfied or
waived, except that the parties have not obtained the necessary approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby from the Superintendent of Insurance of the
State of New York (the "NY DOI"), the parties will proceed with Closing on the
last day of the month in which all of such conditions, except for NY DOI
approval, are satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, subject to the following adjustments:

     (a) The Indemnity Coinsurance Agreements, Transition Services Agreement,
         and Administrative Services Agreements ("Amended Agreements") to be
         entered into between Purchaser and Sellers on the Closing Date will be
         amended to exclude all Coinsured Contracts that are subject to the SMA
         Life Insurance Plan to Protect the People of New York, dated January
         17, 1994, and the related custodian account (the "NY Coinsured
         Contracts"). Appropriate amendments will be made in such agreements and
         adjustments made to this Agreement to reduce, on a pro rata basis, any
         liability, accounts, assets, reserves, ceding commission, purchase
         price adjustments, reserve closing conditions assumed or transferred to
         reflect the removal of the NY Coinsured Contracts. Such adjustments
         shall be based upon

                                       35

<PAGE>

         financial statements prepared by Milliman USA which shall reflect the
         Business with the exclusion of the NY Coinsured Contracts and the
         Business relating to the NY Coinsured Contracts. Purchaser agrees that,
         in such event, it will take all reasonable efforts to cause the NY DOI
         to consent to release AFLIAC from its obligations under the SMA Life
         Insurance Plan to Protect the People of New York to maintain assets in
         the custodian account in an amount equal to 102% of AFLIAC's
         obligations under the NY Coinsured Contracts, and the New York Closing
         shall be contingent on receipt of such consent and release.

     (b) For a period of up to one (1) year after the Closing Date, the parties
         shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of
         the NY DOI for a closing on the NY Coinsured Contracts. On a date (the
         "NY Closing Date") that is the last day of the month in which the
         parties have obtained such required approval from the NY DOI, Purchaser
         and Sellers shall execute and deliver an Indemnity Coinsurance
         Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and an Administrative
         Services Agreement with respect to the NY Coinsured Contracts,
         substantially in the forms attached hereto, with such adjustments to
         reflect, on a pro rata basis, the NY Coinsured Contracts. .

     (c) On the NY Closing Date, the parties shall close, upon the terms hereof,
         on the NY Coinsured Contracts and make whatever adjustments are
         appropriate pursuant to this Agreement to cause the parties to be in
         the same economic position as if the NY Closing Date occurred at the
         same time as the Closing. If agreement on such adjustments cannot be
         reached, the matter shall be addressed in accordance with the
         "Arbitration" Article of the Indemnity Coinsurance Agreement.

Date, Sellers will:

               (i)   not take any action intended to cause lapses, conversions
          or the terminations of any Coinsured Contract;

               (ii)  take no action intended to encourage any agents of a Seller
          to roll over any Coinsured Contract; and

               (iii) pay no commissions to any agent on such Coinsured Contracts
          that is rolled over in the event that, commencing on the Effective
          Date, the lapse rate with respect to Coinsured Contracts exceeds [*]%,
          calculated on an annualized rolling prior 3-month lapse rate basis
          calculated and reported in writing to Purchaser by Sellers each week.

     Section 8.02 Tax Reimbursement. (a) To the extent that (x) an IRS
examination of any year of either of the Sellers or of Purchaser, or (y) an
adjustment reflected on an amended Tax return of either of the Sellers or of
Purchaser that is, in the case of an amended Tax return of a Seller, approved by
Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) or, in the case of an
amended Tax return of Purchaser, approved by Sellers (such approval not be
unreasonably withheld), results in a reduction to the Tax Reserve balances, as
of the Effective Date (or, in the case of Purchaser, as of January 1, 2003) such
that the General Account Reserves, as of the Effective Date, exceed the Tax
Reserves, as of the Effective Date, by more than $3,000,000, Sellers agree to
reimburse promptly to Purchaser an amount equal to the sum of (i) the product of
(a) 35% and (b) the amount by which (x) the excess of the General Account
Reserves over the Tax Reserves, each computed as of the Effective Date, exceeds
(y) $3 million (such excess over $3 million, the "Excess"), except to the extent
that such Excess was previously taken into account in determining the Adjusted
Ceding Commission, plus (ii) interest from the Effective Date at the prevailing
IRS interest rates. To the extent that (x) an IRS examination in respect of any
taxable year of either of the Sellers or of Purchaser, or (y) an adjustment
reflected on an

                                       39

<PAGE>

amended Tax return of either of the Sellers or of Purchaser that is, in the case
of an amended Tax return of a Seller, approved by the Purchaser (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld) or, in the case of an amended Tax return of the
Purchaser, approved by Sellers (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld),
results in an increase to the Tax Reserve balances, as of the Effective Date
(or, in the case of Purchaser, as of January 1, 2003), such that the General
Account Reserves, as of the Effective Date, exceed the Tax Reserves, as of the
Effective Date, by less than $3,000,000, Purchaser agrees to promptly reimburse
to Sellers an amount equal to the sum of (i) the product of (a) 35% and (b) the
amount by which (x) the excess of the General Account Reserves over the Tax
Reserves, each computed as of the Effective Date, is less than (y) $3 million
(the "Shortfall"), plus (ii) interest from the Effective Date at the prevailing
IRS interest rates. All references in this section to Tax Reserves and General
Account Reserves are to such reserves as computed in respect of the Coinsured
Contracts.

     (b) To the extent that any tax cost arises from any Coinsured Contract due
to the status of such contract as a modified endowment contract, the Seller that
is a party to such contract shall reimburse Purchaser for any cost incurred by
Purchaser. In the event that any Coinsured Contract is the subject of an audit
or other examination or similar proceeding by a Taxing Authority that relates to
the status (or possible status) of such contract as a modified endowment
contract or in the event that a claim is made by any Taxing Authority which
might result in a payment under this Section 8.02(b), the party receiving notice
of such audit, investigation or similar proceeding or claim (each, a "Tax
Proceeding") shall promptly notify the other party in writing of such Tax
Proceeding. With respect to any Tax Proceeding that might result in a payment by
a Seller pursuant to this Section 8.02(b), such Seller shall have the right to
control such Tax Proceeding (including selection of counsel) and, without
limiting the foregoing may with the consent of Purchaser (which shall not
unreasonably be withheld) pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect
thereto, and may, in its reasonable discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and
sue for a refund where applicable law permits, or contest the Tax Proceeding in
any permissible manner. The Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in all
proceedings with respect to any such Tax Proceeding (at its expense) and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose. The Seller and Purchaser shall
each provide the other with copies of all material documents with respect to any
such Tax Proceeding. Neither party shall settle or otherwise compromise any Tax
Proceeding without the other party's prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The parties agree to cooperate with each other in
contesting any Tax Proceeding.

     Section 8.03 Asset Adequacy Testing. After the Effective date, Sellers and
Purchaser agree to cooperate in order to obtain an Asset Adequacy Test (ad
defined below). Sellers further agree to provide to Purchaser on or prior to
February 15, 2003, an asset adequacy testing report for each Seller as of
December 31, 2002, prepared in accordance with standards of practice promulgated
by the Actuarial Standards Board consistently applied throughout the periods
covered, of policies issued by the Sellers that would have constituted Coinsured
Contracts if in effect on the date hereof (the "Asset Adequacy Test"). The Asset
Adequacy Test shall state any adjustments and qualifications, and shall be
prepared upon methodologies and valuations and in a form and of the scope agreed
to by Purchaser.

                                       40

     Section 8.04 Post Closing Letter. Within three (3) business days, but no
longer than ten (10) calendar days after the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser
will cooperate to send a letter, reasonably accepted to the parties, to holders

     Section 9.01 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements shall survive the execution and delivery hereof;
provided, however, that, except as set forth in the following sentence, the
representations and warranties of the parties hereto herein shall terminate and
expire on the date that is three (3) years following the Closing Date except for
matters as to which a Claims Notice shall have been given pursuant to Sections
10.01 or 10.02 by a party hereto prior to the applicable expiration date, which
representations shall continue with respect to such matters until such matters
have been finally decided, settled or adjudicated.

Seller contained in this Agreement;

performed by any Seller, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement;

the Closing Date (including, without limitation, any liabilities in excess of
policy limits, liabilities disclosed in any schedule hereto on the date hereof
or disclosed after the date hereof pursuant to Section 5.24 of this Agreement,
and employment related liabilities), but excluding liabilities or obligations of
any kind for which Sellers were released under the settlement in the matter of

May 19, 1999, other than amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such
settlement agreement;

     (d) any Sellers' Retained Liability, but excluding liabilities or
obligations of any kind for which Sellers were released under the settlement in
the matter of Bussie, et al. vs. Allmerica Financial Corp., et al., US District

approved by the court on May 19, 1999, other than amounts payable pursuant to
the terms of such settlement agreement;

     (e) any breach or nonfulfillment by Sellers of, or any failure by Sellers
to perform any of the covenants, terms or conditions of, or any duties or
obligations under, the Indemnity Coinsurance Agreements;

     (f) violations of Applicable Law with respect to underwriting or sales
practices of Sellers or its Producers (as defined in the Administrative Services
Agreements) occurring prior to the Effective Date with respect to the Coinsured
Contracts, but excluding liabilities or obligations of any kind for which
Sellers were released under the settlement in the matter of Bussie, et al. vs.
Allmerica Financial Corp., et al., US District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Civ. Action 97-40204), as approved by the court on May 19, 1999, other than
amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such settlement agreement;

     (g) amounts arising under Code Section 7702 or Section 7702A violations;

     (h) any breach or nonfulfillment by Sellers of, or any failure by Sellers
to perform as applicable, any material representation, warranty, covenant, term
or condition of, or any duties or obligations under, the Software, Trademark or
Copyright License Agreements; and

     (i) the reasonable costs to Purchaser of enforcing this indemnity against
any Seller.

     The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the indemnification
obligation of each Seller under this Article X shall be only for those
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and liabilities of such
Seller and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and liabilities of any other Seller.

     As used in this Article X, "Loss" and/or "Losses" shall mean any loss,
damage, liability, claim, cost or expense, including but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys fees.

     Section 10.02 Obligation of Purchaser to Indemnify.

     Subject to the limitations contained in this Article X, Purchaser agrees to
indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and against all Losses asserted
against, imposed upon or incurred by any Seller resulting from, arising out of,
based upon or otherwise in respect of any of the following:

     (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or

     (b) any material breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

     Section 10.03 Notice of Loss, Asserted Liability. Promptly after (a)
becoming aware of circumstances that have resulted in a Loss for which a party
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.01 or Section 10.02 intends
to seek indemnification under such Section (the "Indemnified Party") or (b)
receipt by the Indemnified Party of written notice of any demand,

                                       42

<PAGE>

claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, the giving of notice or
both, would give rise to a claim or the commencement of any litigation that may
result in a Loss (an "Asserted Liability"), the Indemnified Party shall give
notice thereof (the "Claims Notice") to any other party obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.01 or Section 10.02 (the "Indemnifying
Party"). The Claims Notice shall describe the Loss or the Asserted Liability in
reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of
the Loss or Asserted Liability that has been or may be suffered by the
Indemnified Party. If a Claims Notice is not provided promptly as required by
this Section 10.03, the Indemnified Party nonetheless shall be entitled to
indemnification by the Indemnifying Party except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has failed to provide the Claims Notice prior to the
applicable period in Section 9.01, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
have no rights to indemnity hereunder, in respect thereto.

     Section 10.04 Opportunity to Contest. The Indemnifying Party may elect to
compromise or contest, at its own expense, any Asserted Liability. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or contest such Asserted Liability, it
shall within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Asserted Liability so
requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so by sending a
notice to the Indemnified Party (the "Contest Notice"), and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the
compromise or contest of such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or contest the Asserted Liability or fails to notify
the Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided, the Indemnified Party
(upon further notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to pay,
compromise or contest such Asserted Liability on behalf of and for the account
and risk of the Indemnifying Party. In any event, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party may participate, at their own expense, in the contest of such
Asserted Liability. Each of Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate fully with the
other as to all Asserted Liabilities, shall make available to each other as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to all
Asserted Liabilities and shall preserve all such information, records, and
documents until the termination of any Asserted Liability. Each of Sellers and
Purchaser also shall make available to the other, as reasonably requested, its
personnel, agents, and other representatives who are responsible for preparing
or maintaining information, records, or other documents, or who may have
particular knowledge with respect to any Asserted Liability.

     Section 10.05 Limitations on Indemnification.

     (a) Neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor the Sellers collectively, on
the other hand, shall be required to make any indemnification payment under this
Agreement with respect to a Loss except to the extent the amount of such Loss,
when aggregated with all other such Losses (ignoring, for this purpose, any
materiality or material adverse effect qualifications), shall exceed a dollar
amount equal to 2% of the Ceding Commission, and then only for the amount by
which such Loss exceeds a dollar amount equal to 2% of the Ceding Commission;
and neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor Parent and the Sellers collectively,
on the other hand, shall be required to make indemnification payments hereunder
in the aggregate exceeding a dollar amount equal to 37.5% of the Ceding
Commission; provided, however, that the minimum and maximum limitations
contained in this Section 10.05(a) shall only apply to any Loss arising pursuant
to Sections 10.01(a) and (b) and Sections 10.02(a) and (b) hereof, but not to
include the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities
of the parties contained in

                                       43

Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.04, 3.12, 3.20, 3.21, 3.23, 5.01, 5.07, 5.14, 5.20, 8.01,
8.02 and (to the extent relating to any of such Sections) 10.01(i).

     (b) No party otherwise entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
shall be indemnified pursuant to this Agreement to the extent that such party's
Losses are increased or extended by the willful misconduct, violation of
Applicable Law or bad faith of such party.

     Section 10.06 Sole Remedy. Each party's sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by any other party shall
be the provisions in Article X, provided, however, that nothing set forth in
this Article X shall be deemed to prohibit or limit any party's right at any
time, on or after the Closing Date, to seek injunctive or equitable relief for
the failure of any other party to perform any covenant or agreement contained
herein.

     Section 10.07 Certain Reductions; Subrogation Rights. All indemnification
payments payable hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds
received by, or any Tax benefits inuring to the benefit of, the Indemnified
Party as a result of the Loss for which the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification. In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article X, the Indemnifying
Party shall, upon payment of such indemnity in full, be subrogated to all rights
of the Indemnified Party with respect to the Loss to which such indemnification
relates; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall only be subrogated
to the extent of any amount paid by it pursuant to this Article X in connection
with such Loss.

     Section 10.08 Indemnification Payments. Subject to the terms hereof and
unless contested, if an Indemnifying Party is required to pay an amount to the
Indemnified Party under this Article X the Indemnifying Party shall make such
payment within ten Business Days of determination of the full amount of any
Loss, after receipt of the Claims Notice thereof and the full amount of any Loss
resulting from an Asserted Liability within ten Business Days of the date such
litigation is terminated or the date a final judgment or award is rendered and
no appeal is taken.

     Section 10.09 Effect of Indemnification. Any indemnity payment made
hereunder shall be treated by the Sellers and Purchaser as an adjustment to the
Allocable Amount.

     Section 10.10 Parent Indemnification. Parent agrees to indemnify Purchaser
and hold Purchaser harmless from and against Losses incurred by Purchaser
resulting from a failure by each of the Sellers to comply with their obligations
under this Article X (other than obligations arising under Section 10.01(a)
hereof), except for obligations arising under Sections 3.12, 3.20, 3.21 and 3.23
hereof. Parent shall be afforded the protections regarding notice, limitations
on indemnity, sole remedy, rights to contest and otherwise, of the provisions
set forth in Sections 10.03, 10.04, 10.05, 10.06, 10.07, 10.08 and 10.09 of the
Agreement as if an Indemnifying Party.

<PAGE>

     Section 11.01 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

     (a) by Purchaser or any Seller in writing, if there shall be any order,
writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental or regulatory agency
binding on Purchaser and/or any Seller, which prohibits or restrains Purchaser
and/or any Seller from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, that Purchaser and/or any Seller, as the case may be, shall have used
its commercially reasonable best efforts to have any such order, writ,
injunction or decree lifted and the same shall not have been lifted by June 30,
2003;

     (b) by either a Purchaser or any Seller in writing, if the Closing has not
occurred on or prior to June 30, 2003 unless the absence of such occurrence
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform materially each of its obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed by it on or prior to the Closing Date; and

     (c) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, by mutual written consent
of Sellers and Purchaser.

     Section 11.02 Survival. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as described above, this
Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect, except
for (a) the provisions of this Agreement relating to the obligations of the
parties hereto to keep confidential and not to use certain information and data
obtained from the other parties hereto and (b) the provisions of Sections 5.08,
12.04, 12.06 and this Section 11.02. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein, the provisions of Article X shall survive any termination of
this Agreement for the term of the Indemnity Coinsurance Agreements.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 12.01 Publicity. Except as may otherwise be required by law, no
press release, announcement or filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be made without advance consultation of the other parties hereto with
respect thereto provided however, that neither Seller nor Purchaser, nor any of
their Affiliates, shall issue such a press release until nine days after the
Effective Date, without the prior written consent of the other. The parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other in making any release, announcement or
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Section 12.02 Confidentiality. The parties agree that, other than as agreed
or as required to implement the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties
will keep confidential the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, the Schedules hereto and
thereto, except as otherwise required by law (including, without limitation,
