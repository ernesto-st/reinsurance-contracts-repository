procedures to appoint an umpire for the arbitration with the qualifications set forth above in this
Article. If the use of ARIAS procedures fails to name an umpire, either party may apply to a court
of competent jurisdiction to appoint an umpire with the above required qualifications. The umpire
shall promptly notify in writing all parties to the arbitration of his selection and of the

multiplying one hundred percent (100%) of the reinsurance premium earned by the Reinsurer hereon by
the percentage that the amount reinstated bears to the limit (i.e., ten million dollars

than ten million dollars ($10,000,000) of Net Loss in respect of any one Loss Occurrence, nor more
than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) in Net Loss in all in respect of all losses occurring

Company and submitted to the Reinsurers as soon as practicable after payment of a claim hereunder.
The provisional reinstatement premium shall be based on one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated
annual reinsurance premium earned by the Reinsurer hereunder. The amount of reinstatement premium
due Reinsurers shall be offset against the loss payment due the Company with only the net amount
due to be remitted by the debtor party.

determined, the Company shall prepare and submit to the Reinsurers a final statement of
reinstatement premium due. Any reinstatement premium shown to be due the Reinsurers (less prior
payments, if any) shall be remitted by the Company with its statement. Any return reinstatement
premium shown to be due the Company shall be remitted by the Reinsurers as promptly as possible
after receipt of the Company&#146;s final statement.
