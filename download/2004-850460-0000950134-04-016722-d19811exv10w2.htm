each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other
than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the
corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the

operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable
laws except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in
and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate, including the
Company, has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or
the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section&nbsp;3 of ERISA), and no event,
transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be

actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan&#146;s most
recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current
value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.
The term &#147;benefit liabilities&#148; has the meaning specified in section 4001
of ERISA and the terms &#147;current value&#148; and &#147;present value&#148; have the
meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.

not incurred withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent
withdrawal liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of
Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.

the last day of the Parent&#146;s most recently ended fiscal year in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.&nbsp;106,
without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage
mandated by section 4980B of the Code) of the Parent and its ERISA

under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation of Regulation
X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation
of Regulation&nbsp;T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute
more than 5% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any present intention that margin
stock will constitute more than 5% of the value of such assets. As used in
this Section, the terms &#147;margin stock&#148; and &#147;purpose of buying or carrying&#148;

such Debt to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before
its regularly scheduled dates of payment.

Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and any other parties to the Note Documents
intend to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to
time in effect. In furtherance thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that
none of the terms and provisions contained herein or in the Notes shall ever be
construed to create a contract to pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of
money, interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted to be
charged by applicable law from time to time in effect. Neither the Company,

herewith. You and the Other Purchasers and other holders of the Notes
expressly disavow any intention to contract for, charge, or collect excessive
unearned interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Note is
accelerated. If (a)&nbsp;the maturity of any Note is accelerated for any reason,
(b)&nbsp;any Note is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to constitute interest
are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c)&nbsp;you or any Other
Purchaser or any other holder of any Note shall otherwise collect moneys that
are determined to constitute interest that would otherwise increase the
interest on any or all of the Notes to an amount in excess of that permitted to
be charged by applicable law then in effect, then all sums determined to
constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall, without penalty, be
promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding principal of the related Notes
or, at such Purchaser&#146;s or holder&#146;s option, promptly returned to the Company or
other payor thereof upon such determination. In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable, under any specific circumstance, exceeds the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law, you and the Other Purchasers, other
holders of the Notes, the Company, Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors (and any
other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under applicable
law, (i)&nbsp;characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium
rather than as interest, (ii)&nbsp;exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (iii)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of
interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing
the Notes in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to time
thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect
under applicable law in order to lawfully contract for, charge, or receive the
maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable law. In the event
applicable law provides for an interest ceiling under Chapter&nbsp;303 of the Texas

Company of $45,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes (as defined in the
Note Purchase Agreement) in series;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company is a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the

other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the Guarantor makes this Guaranty as follows:

collect from the Company or upon any other event, contingency or circumstance
whatsoever. If for any reason whatsoever the Company shall fail or be unable
duly, punctually and fully to pay such amounts as and when the same shall
become due and payable, the Guarantor, without demand, presentment, protest or
notice of any kind, will forthwith pay or cause to be paid such amounts to the
Holders under the terms of such Note Documents, in lawful money of the United
States, at the place specified in the Note Purchase Agreement, or perform or
comply with the same or cause the same to be performed or complied with,
together with interest (to the extent provided for under such Note Documents)
on any amount due and owing from the Company. The Guarantor, promptly after
demand, will pay to the Holders the reasonable costs and expenses of collecting
such amounts or otherwise enforcing this Guaranty, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel.

have against the Company or any other person, and to the full extent permitted
by applicable law shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and

any knowledge or notice thereof), including:

an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of
the Notes shall at any time have occurred and be continuing, and such
acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against

the Notes hereinafter referred to, including each purchaser named in the Note
Purchase Agreement hereinafter referred to, and their respective successors and
assigns (collectively, the &#147;Holders&#148; and each individually, a &#147;Holder&#148;).

Encore Wire Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Parent&#148;), and the initial
Holders have entered into a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of August&nbsp;1, 2004
(the Note Purchase Agreement as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time in accordance with its terms and in effect, the
&#147;Note Purchase Agreement&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Note Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance by the
Company of $45,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes (as defined in the
Note Purchase Agreement);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock or partnership interests of each Guarantor and, by
virtue of such ownership and otherwise, each Guarantor will derive substantial
benefits from the purchase by the Holders of the Company&#146;s Notes;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the Holders to
purchase the Notes that each Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this
Guaranty to the Holders; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, each Guarantor desires to execute and deliver this Guaranty to
satisfy the conditions described in the preceding paragraph;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other benefits to

for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are acknowledged, each Guarantor makes this Guaranty as follows:

defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Note Purchase
Agreement.

other Guarantor, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Holders the
due, prompt and complete payment by the Company of the principal of, Make-Whole
Amount, if any, and interest on, and each other amount due under, the Notes or
the Note Purchase Agreement, when and as the same shall become due and payable
(whether at stated maturity or by required or optional prepayment or by

amounts payable by the Company under the Note Documents, and all other monetary
obligations of the Company thereunder (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and
expenses), being sometimes collectively hereinafter referred to as the
&#147;Obligations&#148;). This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not just of
collectibility and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to
collect from the Company or upon any other event, contingency or circumstance
whatsoever. If for any reason whatsoever the Company shall fail or be unable
duly, punctually and fully to pay such amounts as and when the same shall
become due and payable, each Guarantor, without demand, presentment, protest or
notice of any kind, will forthwith pay or cause to be paid such amounts to the
Holders under the terms of such Note Documents, in lawful money of the United
States, at the place specified in the Note Purchase Agreement, or perform or
comply with the same or cause the same to be performed or complied with,

foregoing, the right of recovery against each Guarantor under this Guaranty is
limited to the extent it is judicially determined with respect to any Guarantor
that entering into this Guaranty would violate Section&nbsp;548 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any state law, in which case
such Guarantor shall be liable under this Guaranty only for amounts aggregating
up to the largest amount that would not render such Guarantor&#146;s obligations
hereunder subject to avoidance under Section&nbsp;548 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any state law.

each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional

set-off, deduction, diminution, abatement, recoupment, suspension, deferment,
reduction or defense based upon any claim each Guarantor or any other person
may have against the Company or any other person, and to the full extent
permitted by applicable law shall remain in full force and effect without
regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any
circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not each Guarantor or the
Company shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4. Full Recourse Obligations. The obligations of each Guarantor
set forth herein constitute the full recourse obligations of such Guarantor
enforceable against it to the full extent of all its assets and properties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 5. Waiver. Each Guarantor unconditionally waives, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, (a)&nbsp;notice of any of the matters referred to in
Section&nbsp;3, (b)&nbsp;notice to such Guarantor of the incurrence of any of the
Obligations, notice to such Guarantor or the Company of any breach or default
by such Company with respect to any of the Obligations or any other notice that
may be required, by statute, rule of law or otherwise, to preserve any rights
of the Holders against such Guarantor, (c)&nbsp;presentment to or demand of payment

Document or protest for nonpayment or dishonor, (d)&nbsp;any right to the

surety or which might otherwise limit recourse against such Guarantor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 6. Subrogation, Contribution, Reimbursement or Indemnity. Until
one year and one day after all Obligations have been paid in full, each
Guarantor agrees not to take any action pursuant to any rights which may have
arisen in connection with this Guaranty to be subrogated to any of the rights
(whether contractual, under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended,
including Section&nbsp;509 thereof, under common law or otherwise) of any of the
Holders against the Company or against any collateral security or guaranty or
right of offset held by the Holders for the payment of the Obligations. Until

law, statutory or other rights of reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or
indemnity (or any similar right) from or against the Company which may have
arisen in connection with this Guaranty. So long as the Obligations remain, if
any amount shall be paid by or on behalf of the Company to any Guarantor on
account of any of the rights waived in this paragraph, such amount shall be
held by such Guarantor in trust, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor,
and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the
Holders (duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Holders, if required), to be
applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as
the Holders may determine. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7. Effect of Bankruptcy Proceedings, etc. This Guaranty shall
continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if
at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the sums due to any of the
Holders pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement or any other Note
Document is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by such Holder
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of
the Company or any other person, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect
to the Company or other person or any substantial part of its property, or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If an event
permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of the
Notes shall at any time have occurred and be continuing, and such acceleration
shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the Company
or any other person of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency
law, each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty and its
obligations hereunder, the maturity of the principal amount of the Notes and
all other Obligations shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same
effect as if any Holder had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms
of the Note Purchase Agreement or other applicable Note Document, and such
Guarantor shall forthwith pay such principal amount, Make-Whole Amount, if any,
and interest thereon and any other amounts guaranteed hereunder without further
notice or demand.

all of the agreements of such Guarantor hereunder shall be duly paid and
performed in full and (ii)&nbsp;such Guarantor is released by the Holders pursuant
to Section&nbsp;1.2(b) of the Note Purchase Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 9. Representations and Warranties. Each Guarantor represents and
warrants to each Holder that:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) such Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the
power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports
to own or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and
proposes to transact,;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) such Guarantor has the power and authority to execute and
deliver this Guaranty and to perform the provisions hereof, and this
Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of

obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by (i)&nbsp;applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors&#146; rights generally and (ii)&nbsp;general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law);

hereunder, (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of the assets of such Guarantor (both at
fair valuation and at present fair saleable value) exceeds its
liabilities, (iii)&nbsp;such Guarantor is able to and expects to be able to
pay its debts as they mature, and (iv)&nbsp;such Guarantor has capital
sufficient to carry on its business as conducted and as proposed to be
conducted.

hereunder shall be in writing and sent by telecopy if the sender on the same
day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery
service (charges prepaid), or by registered or certified mail with return
receipt requested (postage prepaid), or by a recognized overnight delivery

by each Guarantor herein or in any certificate or other instrument delivered by
it or on its behalf hereunder shall be considered to have been relied upon by
the Holders and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guaranty,
regardless of any investigation made by any of the Holders. All statements in
any such certificate or other instrument shall constitute warranties and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>SECTION 12. Submission to Jurisdiction. Any litigation based hereon, or
arising out of, under or in connection with this Guaranty, may be brought and

that renders any provisions hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.
The terms of this Guaranty shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of,

<P align="right" style="font-size: 10pt">EXHIBIT 4.4(a)



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL<BR>
FOR THE COMPANY



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion of Thompson &#038; Knight LLP, counsel for the Parent, the Company
and the Subsidiary Guarantors, shall be to the effect that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The Company is a limited partnership validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Texas. Each of the Parent, EWC GP
Corp. and EWC LP Corp. is a corporation validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. EWC Aviation Corp. is a corporation
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Each of the Company, the Parent and each Subsidiary Guarantor has the
corporate or partnership power to execute and deliver the Agreement, the Notes
and the Guaranty (the &#147;Note Documents&#148;), in each case to which it is a party,
and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and
performance of each Note Document has been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or partnership proceedings on the part of each Client a party
thereto. Each Client has duly executed and delivered each Note Document to
which it is a party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;If, notwithstanding the choice of Illinois law contained in the Note
Documents, Texas law were applied to such instruments, each Note Document would
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, the Parent
and each Subsidiary Guarantor (to the extent a party thereto) under Texas law,
enforceable against each in accordance with its terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Company, the
Parent and each Subsidiary Guarantor of the Note Documents to which it is a
party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, will not:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) violate any provision of its organizational documents, or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) breach or result in a default under or result in the maturing of
any of indebtedness, or create any lien, security interest or other
encumbrance, on any of its property pursuant to, the agreements and
instruments listed on Schedule&nbsp;C hereto, which have been identified by it
as all indentures, mortgages, deeds of trust and other Material
agreements and instruments to which it is a party; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) result in a violation of any federal or state law, rule or
regulation or, to our knowledge, any judgment, order, decree,
determination or award of any federal or state court or governmental
authority which is now in effect and applicable to such it or any of its
properties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;To the knowledge of such counsel, no consent, approval, waiver,
license, authorization or action by or filing with or notice to any federal or

of the Company, the Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any Note Document to
which it is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the
Company in Paragraph&nbsp;5.14 of the Agreement, the extension of credit to the
Company pursuant to the Agreement, and the use of the proceeds therefrom by the
Company as represented and warranted by the Company in such Paragraph&nbsp;5.14 of
the Agreement, do not violate Regulations T, U or X promulgated by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System..


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;None of the Company, the Parent or any Subsidiary is (a)&nbsp;an &#147;investment
company&#148; or a company &#147;controlled&#148; by an &#147;investment company&#148; within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (b)&nbsp;a &#147;public

&#147;affiliate&#148; of a &#147;holding company&#148; within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Assuming (a)&nbsp;the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by
the Company and the Parent in Section&nbsp;5.13 of the Agreement and by each
Purchaser in Section&nbsp;6.1 of the Agreement, (b)&nbsp;the due performance by the
Company and the Parent of the covenants set forth in Section&nbsp;5.13 of the
Agreement (and that no one acting on their behalf has taken any action
prohibited therein), and (c)&nbsp;each Purchaser&#146;s compliance with the offering
procedures and restrictions described in the Private Placement Memorandum dated
July, 2004 relating to the offering of the Notes, it is not necessary in
connection with the offering, issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes under
the circumstances contemplated by the Agreement to register the Notes under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify an indenture with respect to
the Notes under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Such counsel need
not opine as to when or under what circumstances any Notes initially sold to
the Purchasers may be reoffered or resold.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The opinion of Thompson &#038; Knight LLP, shall cover such other matters relating
to the sale of the Notes as the Purchasers may reasonably request. With
respect to matters of fact on which such opinion is based, such counsel shall
be entitled to rely on appropriate certificates of public officials and
officers of the Company and with respect to matters governed by the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States of America, the laws of the State of
Texas or the Delaware General Corporation Law, such counsel may rely upon the
opinions of counsel deemed (and stated in their opinion to be deemed) by them
to be competent and reliable. The opinions shall state that subsequent
transferees and assignees of the Notes may rely thereon.

TO THE PURCHASERS



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion of Gardner Carton &#038; Douglas LLP, special counsel to the
Purchasers, shall be to the effect that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The Agreement and the Notes constitute the legal, valid and binding
agreements of the Company and the Parent, as the case may be, enforceable in
accordance with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
the rights of creditors or by equitable principles, regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The Guaranties constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Parent and each Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by

offering, sale and delivery of the Notes and the execution and delivery of the
Guaranties do not require the registration of the Notes or the Guaranties under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, nor the qualification of an indenture
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;No approval, consent or withholding of objection on the part of, or
filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental body, Federal or
state, is necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of the
Agreement or the Notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Gardner Carton &#038; Douglas LLP may rely upon the opinion of Thompson &#038; Knight LLP
(i)&nbsp;as to the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Parent, the

Douglas, and, in its opinion, the Purchasers and it are justified in relying
