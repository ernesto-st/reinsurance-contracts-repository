Article 7 - Reinstatement   A.  In the event all or any portion of the reinsurance coverage provided under Coverage A is      exhausted by ultimate net loss, the amount so exhausted shall be reinstated immediately      from the time the loss occurrence commences hereon.  For each amount so reinstated the      Company agrees to pay additional premium equal to the product of the following:         1.  The percentage of the occurrence limit for Coverage A reinstated (based on the           ultimate net loss paid by the Reinsurer under Coverage A); times         2.

Whenever the Company requests payment by the Reinsurer of any ultimate net loss under      Coverage A, the Company shall submit a statement to the Reinsurer of reinstatement      premium due the Reinsurer for that coverage section.  If the earned reinsurance premium      for Coverage A for the term of this Contract has not been finally determined as of the date      of any such statement, the calculation of reinstatement premium due for Coverage A shall      be based on the amount shown as &quot;Annual Deposit Premium&quot; for Coverage A in      Schedule A attached hereto, and shall be readjusted when the earned reinsurance      premium for Coverage A for the term of this Contract has been finally determined.

Article 18 - Liability of the Reinsurer   A.  The liability of the Reinsurer shall follow that of the Company in every case and be subject      in all respects to all the general and specific stipulations, clauses, waivers and modifications      of the Company's policies and any endorsements thereon.  However, in no event shall this      be construed in any way to provide coverage outside the terms and conditions set forth in      this Contract.    B.  Nothing herein shall in any manner create any obligations or establish any rights against      the Reinsurer in favor of any third party or any persons not parties to this Contract.      Article 19 - Net Retained Lines (BRMA 32E)   A.  This Contract applies only to that portion of any policy which the Company retains net for its      own account (prior to deduction of any underlying reinsurance specifically permitted in this      Contract), and in calculating the amount of any loss hereunder and also in computing the      amount or amounts in excess of which this Contract attaches, only loss or losses in respect      of that portion of any policy which the Company retains net for its own account shall be      included.    B.  The amount of the Reinsurer's liability hereunder in respect of any loss or losses shall not      be increased by reason of the inability of the Company to collect from any other      reinsurer(s), whether specific or general, any amounts which may have become due from      such reinsurer(s), whether such inability arises from the insolvency of such other      reinsurer(s) or otherwise.      Article 20 - Errors and Omissions (BRMA 14F)   Inadvertent delays, errors or omissions made in connection with this Contract or any transaction  hereunder shall not relieve either party from any liability which would have attached had such  delay, error or omission not occurred, provided always that such error or omission is rectified as  soon as possible after discovery.

The Reinsurer has agreed to allow for the purpose of paying the Federal Excise Tax the      applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as imposed under Section 4371 of      the Internal Revenue Code) to the extent such premium is subject to the Federal Excise      Tax.    B.

Article 26 - Insolvency   A.  In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to      the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of      the liability of the Company without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or      because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has      failed to pay all or a portion of any claim.  It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver,      conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the      Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond      reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a      reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in      the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate      such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be      adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its      liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the      Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company      as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the      benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by      the Reinsurer.    B.  Where two or more Subscribing Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in      interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in      accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by      the Company.    C.  It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the      reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company      or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by Section 4118(a) of      the New York Insurance Law or except (1) where this Contract specifically provides another      payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or (2) where the      Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy      obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such      policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees.      Article 27 - Arbitration   A.  As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or      difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually      agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One      Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall      be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active      or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's      London Underwriters.

B.  Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters within 30 days following the date of      appointment of the Umpire.  The Arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable      engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial      formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the      Arbiters shall be final and binding on both parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the      Umpire and the decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon both parties.       Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters may be entered in any court of competent      jurisdiction.    C.

D.  Each party shall bear the expense of its own Arbiter, and shall jointly and equally bear with      the other the expense of the Umpire and of the arbitration.  In the event that the two      Arbiters are chosen by one party, as above provided, the expense of the Arbiters, the      Umpire and the arbitration shall be equally divided between the two parties.

It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount claimed to be due      hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a      court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.  Nothing in this Article constitutes or      should be understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an      action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a      United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another court as permitted by      the laws of the United States or of any state in the United States.

This Reinsurance does not cover any loss or liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as Insurer or       Reinsurer, from any Pool of Insurers or Reinsurers formed for the purpose of covering Atomic or Nuclear Energy risks.    2.   Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph (1) of this Clause, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss or       liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, from any insurance against       Physical Damage (including business interruption or consequential loss arising out of such Physical Damage) to:           I.  Nuclear reactor power plants including all auxiliary property on the site, or          II.  Any other nuclear reactor installation, including laboratories handling radioactive materials in connection with reactor             installations, and &quot;critical facilities&quot; as such, or          III.  Installations for fabricating complete fuel elements or for processing substantial quantities of &quot;special nuclear material,&quot;             and for reprocessing, salvaging, chemically separating, storing or disposing of &quot;spent&quot; nuclear fuel or waste materials, or         IV.   Installations other than those listed in paragraph (2) III above using substantial quantities of radioactive isotopes or other             products of nuclear fission.    3.   Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss or       liability by radioactive contamination accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer,       from any insurance on property which is on the same site as a nuclear reactor power plant or other nuclear installation and       which normally would be insured therewith except that this paragraph (3) shall not operate         (a)   where Reassured does not have knowledge of such nuclear reactor power plant or nuclear installation, or         (b)   where said insurance contains a provision excluding coverage for damage to property caused by or resulting from             radioactive contamination, however caused.  However on and after 1st January 1960 this sub-paragraph (b) shall only             apply provided the said radioactive contamination exclusion provision has been approved by the Governmental             Authority having jurisdiction thereof.    4.   Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) hereof, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss or       liability by radioactive contamination accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer,       when such radioactive contamination is a named hazard specifically insured against.    5.   It is understood and agreed that this Clause shall not extend to risks using radioactive isotopes in any form where the nuclear       exposure is not considered by the Reassured to be the primary hazard.    6.   The term &quot;special nuclear material&quot; shall have the meaning given it in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 or by any law       amendatory thereof.    7.   Reassured to be sole judge of what constitutes:         (a)   substantial quantities, and         (b)   the extent of installation, plant or site.    Note.-Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph (1) hereof, it is understood and agreed that         (a)   all policies issued by the Reassured on or before 31st December 1957 shall be free from the application of the other             provisions of this Clause until expiry date or 31st December 1960 whichever first occurs whereupon all the provisions of             this Clause shall apply.         (b)   with respect to any risk located in Canada policies issued by the Reassured on or before 31st December 1958 shall be             free from the application of the other provisions of this Clause until expiry date or 31st December 1960 whichever first             occurs whereupon all the provisions of this Clause shall apply.    12/12/57  N.M.A. 1119  BRMA 35B    18\F7V1075      </FONT></DIV>

This Contract excludes loss or liability arising from:         1.  Business derived directly or indirectly from any pool, association, or syndicate which           maintains its own reinsurance facilities.  This subparagraph 1 shall not apply with           respect to:             a.  Residual market mechanisms created by statute.  This Contract shall not extend,               however, to afford coverage for liability arising from the inability of any other               participant or member in the residual market mechanism to meet its obligations,               nor shall this Contract extend to afford coverage for liability arising from any               claim against the residual market mechanism brought by or on behalf of any               insolvency fund (as defined in the Insolvency Fund Exclusion Clause               incorporated in this Contract).

This subparagraph 2 shall not           apply:             a.  If the total insured value over all interests of the risk is less than $250,000,000.             b.  To interests traditionally underwritten as Inland Marine or Stock or Contents               written on a blanket basis.             c.  To Contingent Business Interruption liability, except when it is known to the               Company, at the time the risk is bound, that the key location is insured by or               through any pool, association or syndicate formed for the purpose of insuring oil,               gas, or petro-chemical plants; oil or gas drilling rigs; and/or aviation risks; unless               the total insured value over all interests of the risk is less than $250,000,000.

The result of any rate increase filing permitted by the terms of the Company's          participation or membership in any such residual market mechanism following any           assessment shall have no effect on the Company's ultimate net loss for any covered           loss occurrence.         4.
