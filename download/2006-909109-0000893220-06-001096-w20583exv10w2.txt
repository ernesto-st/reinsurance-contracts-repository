          or casualty treaty reinsurance business.

C.   If this Contract is terminated or expires while a loss occurrence covered
     hereunder is in progress, the Reinsurer's liability hereunder shall,
     subject to the other terms and conditions of this Contract, be determined
     as if the entire loss occurrence had occurred prior to the termination or
     expiration of this Contract, provided that no part of such loss occurrence
     is claimed against any renewal or replacement of this Contract.

D.   The Reinsurer shall have no liability hereunder with respect to losses
     arising out of loss occurrences commencing after the effective date of
     termination or expiration.

          with any action in controlling, preventing, suppressing, retaliating
          against or responding to any act of terrorism.

          Notwithstanding the above and subject otherwise to the terms,
          conditions, and limitations of this Contract, in respect only of
          personal lines this Contract will pay actual loss or damage (but not
          related cost or expense) caused by any act of terrorism provided such
          act is not directly or indirectly caused by, contributed to by,
          resulting from, or arising out of or in connection with biological,
          chemical, radioactive, or nuclear pollution or contamination or
          explosion.

     12.  Loss or liability in any way or to any extent arising out of the
          actual or alleged presence or actual, alleged or threatened presence
          of fungi including, but not limited to, mold, mildew, mycotoxins,
          microbial volatile organic compounds or other "microbial
          contaminations." This includes:

          a.   Any supervision, instruction, recommendations, warnings or advice
               given or which should have been given in connection with the
               above; and

          b.   Any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who
               must pay damages because of such injury or damage.

          For purposes of this exclusion, "microbial contamination" means any
          contamination, either airborne or surface, which arises out of or is
          related to the presence of fungi, mold, mildew, mycotoxins, microbial
          volatile organic compounds or spores, including, without limitation,
          Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Aspergillus Flavus and
          Stachybotrys chartarum.

          Losses resulting from the above causes do not in and of themselves
          constitute an event unless arising out of one or more of the following
          perils, in which case this exclusion does not apply:

               Fire, lightning, explosion, aircraft or vehicle impact, falling
               objects, windstorm, hail, tornado, cyclone, hurricane,

          commencement date of the loss occurrence to which such claims relate.

                                                                          (LOGO)

     13.  Loss or liability excluded under the provisions of the "Electronic
          Data Endorsement B" (N.M.A. 2915) attached to and forming part of this
          Contract.

ARTICLE V - RETENTION AND LIMIT

A.   As respects each excess layer of reinsurance coverage provided by this
     Contract, the Company shall retain and be liable for the first amount of
     ultimate net loss, shown as "Company's Retention" for that excess layer in
     Schedule A attached hereto, arising out of each loss occurrence. The
     Reinsurer shall then be liable, as respects each excess layer, for the
     amount by which such ultimate net loss exceeds the Company's applicable
     retention, but the liability of the Reinsurer under each excess layer shall
     not exceed the amount, shown as "Reinsurer's Per Occurrence Limit" for that
     excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto, as respects any one loss
     occurrence.

B.   No claim shall be made under any excess layer of reinsurance coverage
     provided by this Contract as respects any one loss occurrence unless at
     least two risks insured or reinsured by the Company are involved in such
     loss occurrence. For purposes of this Contract, the Company shall be the
     sole judge of what constitutes one risk.

ARTICLE VI - REINSTATEMENT

A.   In the event all or any portion of the reinsurance under any excess layer
     of reinsurance coverage provided by this Contract is exhausted by loss, the
     amount so exhausted shall be reinstated immediately from the time the loss
     occurrence commences hereon. For each amount so reinstated the Company
     agrees to pay additional premium equal to the product of the following:

     1.   The percentage of the occurrence limit for the excess layer reinstated
          (based on the loss paid by the Reinsurer under that excess layer);
          times

     2.   The final adjusted reinsurance premium, as calculated in accordance
          with Article XIII, for the excess layer reinstated for the term of
          this Contract (exclusive of reinstatement premium).

B.   Whenever the Company requests payment by the Reinsurer of any loss under
     any excess layer hereunder, the Company shall submit a statement to the
     Reinsurer of reinstatement premium due the Reinsurer for that excess layer.
     If the final adjusted reinsurance premium for any excess layer for the term
     of this Contract has not been determined as of the date of any such
     statement, the calculation of reinstatement premium due for that excess
     layer shall be based on the annual deposit premium for that excess layer
     and shall be readjusted when the final adjusted reinsurance premium for
     that excess layer for the term of this Contract has been determined. Any
     reinstatement premium shown to be due the Reinsurer for any excess layer as
     reflected by any such statement (less prior payments, if any, for that
     excess layer) shall be payable by the Company concurrently with payment by
     the Reinsurer of the requested loss for that excess layer. Any return
     reinstatement premium shown to be due the Company shall be remitted by the
     Reinsurer as promptly as possible after receipt and verification of the
     Company's statement.

                                                                          (LOGO)

C.   Notwithstanding anything stated herein, the liability of the Reinsurer
     under any excess layer of reinsurance coverage provided by this Contract
     shall not exceed either of the following:

     1.   The amount, shown as "Reinsurer's Per Occurrence Limit" for that
          excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto, as respects loss or losses
          arising out of any one loss occurrence; or

     2.   The amount, shown as "Reinsurer's Term Limit" for that excess layer in
          Schedule A attached hereto, in all during the term of this Contract.

D.   If this Contract is terminated, and the reinstatement premium is less than
     the loss, the Reinsurer shall pay the loss prior to receiving the
     reinstatement premium.

E.   Any reinstatement premium paid or otherwise due the Reinsurer for losses
     arising out of loss occurrences commencing on or prior to the effective
     date of termination shall be considered fully earned for purposes of this
     Article.

ARTICLE VII - DEFINITIONS

A.   "Ultimate net loss" as used herein is defined as the sum or sums (including
     loss in excess of policy limits, extra contractual obligations and loss
     adjustment expense, as hereinafter defined) paid or payable by the Company
     in settlement of claims and in satisfaction of judgments rendered on
     account of such claims, after deduction of all salvage, all recoveries and
     all claims on inuring insurance or reinsurance, whether collectible or not.
     Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that losses under this Contract
     are not recoverable until the Company's ultimate net loss has been
     ascertained.

B.   "Loss in excess of policy limits" and "extra contractual obligations" as
     used herein shall be defined as follows:

     1.   "Loss in excess of policy limits" shall mean 90.0% of any amount paid
          or payable by the Company in excess of its policy limits, but
          otherwise within the terms of its policy, such loss in excess of the
          Company's policy limits having been incurred because of, but not
          limited to, failure by the Company to settle within the policy limits
          or by reason of the Company's alleged or actual negligence, fraud or
          bad faith in rejecting an offer of settlement or in the preparation of
          the defense or in the trial of any action against its insured or
          reinsured or in the preparation or prosecution of an appeal consequent
          upon such an action.

     2.   "Extra contractual obligations" shall mean 90.0% of any punitive,
          exemplary, compensatory or consequential damages paid or payable by
          the Company, not covered by any other provision of this Contract and
          which arise from the handling of any claim on business subject to this
          Contract, such liabilities arising because of, but not limited to,
          failure by the Company to settle within the policy limits or by reason
          of the Company's alleged or actual negligence, fraud or bad faith in
          rejecting an offer of settlement or in the preparation of the defense
          or in the trial of any action against its insured or reinsured or in
          the preparation or prosecution of an appeal consequent upon such an
          action. An extra contractual obligation shall be deemed, in all
          circumstances, to have occurred on the same date as the loss covered
          or alleged to be covered under the policy.

                                                                          (LOGO)

<PAGE>

     Notwithstanding anything stated herein, the amount included in the ultimate
     net loss for any one loss occurrence as respects loss in excess of policy
     limits and extra contractual obligations shall not exceed 25.0% of the
     Company's indemnity loss hereunder arising out of that loss occurrence.

     Notwithstanding anything stated herein, this Contract shall not apply to
     any loss in excess of policy limits or any extra contractual obligation
     incurred by the Company as a result of any fraudulent and/or criminal act
     by any officer or director of the Company acting individually or
     collectively or in collusion with any individual or corporation or any
     other organization or party involved in the presentation, defense or
     settlement of any claim covered hereunder.

C.   "Loss adjustment expense" as used herein shall mean expenses assignable to
     the investigation, appraisal, adjustment, settlement, litigation, defense
     and/or appeal of specific claims, regardless of how such expenses are
     classified for statutory reporting purposes. Loss adjustment expense shall
     include, but not be limited to, declaratory judgments, interest on
     judgments, expenses of outside adjusters, and a pro rata share of the
     salaries and expenses of the Company's field employees according to the
     time occupied adjusting such losses and expenses of the Company's officials
     incurred in connection with the losses, but shall not include office
     expenses or salaries of the Company's regular employees.

ARTICLE IX - LOSS OCCURRENCE

A.   The term "loss occurrence" shall mean the sum of all individual losses

     disasters, accidents or losses arising out of one event which occurs within
     the area of one state of the United States or province of Canada and states
     or provinces contiguous thereto and to one another. However, the duration
     and extent of any one "loss occurrence" shall be limited to all individual
     losses sustained by the Company occurring during any period of 168
     consecutive hours arising out of and directly occasioned by the same event,
     except that the term "loss occurrence" shall be further defined as follows:

     1.   As regards hurricane and tropical storm, including ensuing collapse
          and water damage, all individual losses sustained by the Company
          occurring during any period of 96 consecutive hours arising out of and
          directly occasioned by the same event. However, the event need not be
          limited to one state or province or states or provinces contiguous
          thereto.

     2.   As regards windstorm (excluding hurricane and tropical storm), hail,
          tornado, cyclone, including ensuing collapse and water damage, all
          individual losses

                                                                          (LOGO)

<PAGE>

          sustained by the Company occurring during any period of 72 consecutive
          hours arising out of and directly occasioned by the same event.
          However, the event need not be limited to one state or province or

          one municipality or county and the municipalities or counties
          contiguous thereto arising out of and directly occasioned by the same
          event. The maximum duration of 72 consecutive hours may be extended in
          respect of individual losses which occur beyond such 72 consecutive
          hours during the continued occupation of an insured's premises by
          strikers, provided such occupation commenced during the aforesaid
          period.

     4.   As regards earthquake (the epicentre of which need not necessarily be
          within the territorial confines referred to in the introductory
          portion of this paragraph) and fire following directly occasioned by
          the earthquake, only those individual fire losses which commence
          during the period of 168 consecutive hours may be included in the
          Company's "loss occurrence."

     5    As regards "freeze," only individual losses directly occasioned by
          collapse, breakage of glass and water damage (caused by bursting
          frozen pipes and tanks) may be included in the Company's "loss
          occurrence."

     6.   As regards firestorms, brush fires, and any other fires or series of
          fires, irrespective of origin (except as provided in subparagraphs 3
          and 4 above), which spread through trees, grassland or other
          vegetation, all individual losses sustained by the Company which occur
          during any period of 168 consecutive hours within a 100-mile radius of
          any fixed point selected by the Company may be included in the
          Company's "loss occurrence." However, an individual loss subject to
          this subparagraph cannot be included in more than one "loss
          occurrence."

B.   For all those "loss occurrences," other than those referred to in
     subparagraph 3 of paragraph A above, the Company may choose the date and
     time when any such period of consecutive hours commences, provided that it
     is not earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of the first
     recorded individual loss sustained by the Company arising out of that
     disaster, accident or loss, and provided that only one such period of 168
     consecutive hours shall apply with respect to one event, except for any
     "loss occurrence" referred to in subparagraph 1 of paragraph A above where
     only one such period of 96 consecutive hours shall apply with respect to
     one event, regardless of the duration of the event and subparagraph 2 of
     paragraph A above where only one such period of 72 consecutive hours shall
     apply with respect to one event, regardless of the duration of the event.

C.   As respects those "loss occurrences" referred to in subparagraph 3 of
     paragraph A above, if the disaster, accident or loss occasioned by the
     event is of greater duration than 72 consecutive hours, then the Company
     may divide that disaster, accident or loss into two or more "loss
     occurrences," provided no two periods overlap and no individual loss is
     included in more than one such period and provided that no period commences
     earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of the first recorded
     individual loss sustained by the Company arising out of that disaster,
     accident or loss.

                                                                          (LOGO)


Page 8

<PAGE>

D.   No individual losses occasioned by an event that would be covered by 72
     hours or 96 hours clauses may be included in any "loss occurrence" claimed
     under the 168 hours provision.

ARTICLE X - LOSS NOTICES AND SETTLEMENTS

A.   Whenever losses sustained by the Company appear likely to result in a claim
     hereunder, the Company shall notify the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer shall
     have the right to participate in the adjustment of such losses at its own
     expense.

B.   All loss settlements made by the Company, provided they are within the
     terms of this Contract, shall be binding upon the Reinsurer, and the
     Reinsurer agrees to pay all amounts for which it may be liable upon receipt
     of reasonable evidence of the amount paid (or scheduled to be paid) by the
     Company.

ARTICLE XI - SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION

The Reinsurer shall be credited with salvage (i.e., reimbursement obtained or
recovery made by the Company, less the actual cost, excluding salaries of
officials and employees of the Company and sums paid to attorneys as retainer,
of obtaining such reimbursement or making such recovery) on account of claims
and settlements involving reinsurance hereunder. Salvage thereon shall always be
used to reimburse the excess carriers in the reverse order of their priority
according to their participation before being used in any way to reimburse the
Company for its primary loss. The Company hereby agrees to enforce its rights to
salvage or subrogation relating to any loss, a part of which loss was sustained
by the Reinsurer, and to prosecute all claims arising out of such rights.

ARTICLE XII - FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND

A.   Any loss reimbursement paid or payable to the Company under the Florida
     Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) as a result of loss occurrences
     commencing during the term of this Contract shall inure to the benefit of
     this Contract.

B.   Prior to the determination of the Company's FHCF retention and payout, if
     any, under the reimbursement contract between the Company and the State
     Board of Administration of the State of Florida, the Reinsurer's liability
     hereunder will be determined provisionally based on the projected payout,
     determined in accordance with the provisions of the reimbursement contract.
     Following determination of the payout under the reimbursement contract, the
     ultimate net loss under this Contract will be recalculated. If, as a result
     of such calculation, the loss to the Reinsurer under any excess layer of
     this Contract in any one loss occurrence is less than the amount previously
     paid by the Reinsurer under that excess layer, the Company shall promptly
     remit the difference to the Reinsurer. If the loss to the Reinsurer under
     any excess layer in any one loss occurrence is greater than the amount
     previously paid by the Reinsurer, the Reinsurer shall promptly remit the
     difference to the Company.

C.   If an FHCF reimbursement amount is based on the Company's losses in more
     than one loss occurrence commencing during the term of this Contract, the
     total FHCF reimbursement received by the Company shall be allocated to
     individual loss occurrences

                                                                          (LOGO)

     in chronological order of the dates such loss occurrences commence,
     beginning with the first such loss occurrence commencing during the term of
     this Contract, provided that:

     1.   The portion of the total FHCF reimbursement amount to be allocated by
          the Company to any individual loss occurrence shall be equal to the
          lesser of: (a) the amount of FHCF reimbursement to which the Company
          would be entitled for that loss occurrence alone, or (b) the remaining
          FHCF reimbursement which has not been allocated by the Company to
          prior loss occurrences; and

     2.   The total amount allocated by the Company to all such loss occurrences
          shall be equal to the total FHCF reimbursement received by the Company
          for such loss occurrences.

D.   Any reimbursement premiums or emergency assessment paid by the Company
     under the FHCF shall be deemed to be premiums paid for inuring reinsurance.

ARTICLE XIII - REINSURANCE PREMIUM

A.   As premium for each excess layer of reinsurance coverage provided by this
     Contract, the Company shall pay the Reinsurer the greater of the following:

     1.   The amount, shown as "Minimum Premium" for that excess layer in
          Schedule A attached hereto (in the event this Contract is terminated
          prior to May 31, 2006, no minimum premium shall apply); or

     2.   The percentage, shown as "Premium Rate" for that excess layer in
          Schedule A attached hereto, of the Company's gross earned premium for
          Property business during the term of this Contract.

B.   The Company shall pay the Reinsurer a deposit premium for each excess layer
     of the amount, shown as "Deposit Premium" for that excess layer in Schedule
     A attached hereto, in four equal installments of the amount, shown as
     "Quarterly Deposit Premium" for that excess layer in Schedule A attached
     hereto, on June 1, September 1 and December 1 of 2005 and March 1, 2006.
     However, if this Contract is terminated prior to May 31, 2006, no deposit
     premium installments shall be due from the Company after the effective date
     of termination, and the Reinsurer shall return the unearned portion of any
     deposit premium paid by the Company.

C.   Within 45 days after the termination or expiration of this Contract, the
     Company shall provide a report to the Reinsurer setting forth the premium
     due hereunder for each excess layer, computed in accordance with paragraph
     A, and any additional premium due the Reinsurer or return premium due the
     Company for each such excess layer shall be remitted promptly.

D.   "Gross earned premium" as used herein is defined as earned premium of the
     Company for the classes of business reinsured hereunder, before the
     deduction of any premiums ceded by the Company for reinsurance which inures
     to the benefit of this Contract.

                                                                          (LOGO)

ARTICLE XIV - LATE PAYMENTS

A.   The provisions of this Article shall not be implemented unless specifically
     invoked, in writing, by one of the parties to this Contract.

B.   In the event any premium, loss or other payment due either party is not
     received by the intermediary named in Article XXXI (hereinafter referred to
     as the "Intermediary") by the payment due date, the party to whom payment
     is due, may, by notifying the Intermediary in writing, require the debtor
     party to pay, and the debtor party agrees to pay, an interest penalty on
     the amount past due calculated for each such payment on the last business
     day of each month as follows:

     1.   The number of full days which have expired since the due date or the
          last monthly calculation, whichever the lesser; times

     2.   1/365ths of the six-month United States Treasury Bill rate, as quoted
          in The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the month for
          which the calculation is made; times

     3.   The amount past due, including accrued interest.

     It is agreed that interest shall accumulate until payment of the original
     amount due plus interest penalties have been received by the Intermediary.

C.   The establishment of the due date shall, for purposes of this Article, be
     determined as follows:

     1.   As respects the payment of routine deposits and premiums due the
          Reinsurer, the due date shall be as provided for in the applicable
          section of this Contract. In the event a due date is not specifically
          stated for a given payment, it shall be deemed due 30 days after the
          date of transmittal by the Intermediary of the initial billing for
          each such payment.

     2.   Any claim or loss payment due the Company hereunder shall be deemed
          due 10 business days after the proof of loss or demand for payment is
          transmitted to the Reinsurer. If such loss or claim payment is not
          received within the 10 days, interest will accrue on the payment or
          amount overdue in accordance with paragraph B above, from the date the
          proof of loss or demand for payment in accordance with Article X, was
          transmitted to the Reinsurer.

     3.   As respects any payment, adjustment or return due either party not
          otherwise provided for in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of paragraph C above,
          the due date shall be as provided for in the applicable section of
          this Contract. In the event a due date is not specifically stated for
          a given payment, it shall be deemed due 10 business days following
          transmittal of written notification that the provisions of this
          Article have been invoked.

     For purposes of interest calculations only, amounts due hereunder shall be
     deemed paid upon receipt by the Intermediary.

                                                                          (LOGO)

D.   Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting a Subscribing
     Reinsurer from contesting the validity of any claim, or from participating
     in the defense of any claim or suit, or prohibiting either party from
     contesting the validity of any payment or from initiating any arbitration
     or other proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this Contract. If
     the debtor party prevails in an arbitration or other proceeding, then any
     interest penalties due hereunder on the amount in dispute shall be null and
     void. If the debtor party loses in such proceeding, then the interest
     penalty on the amount determined to be due hereunder shall be calculated in
     accordance with the provisions set forth above unless otherwise determined
     by such proceedings. If a debtor party advances payment of any amount it is
     contesting, and proves to be correct in its contestation, either in whole
     or in part, the other party shall reimburse the debtor party for any such
     excess payment made plus interest on the excess amount calculated in
     accordance with this Article.

E.   Interest penalties arising out of the application of this Article that are
     $100 or less from any party shall be waived unless there is a pattern of
     late payments consisting of three or more items over the course of any
     12-month period.

ARTICLE XV - OFFSET (BRMA 36D)

The Company and the Reinsurer, each at its option, may offset any balance or
balances, whether on account of premiums, claims and losses, loss expenses or
salvages due from one party to the other under this Contract; provided, however,
that in the event of the insolvency of a party hereto, offsets shall only be
allowed in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.

ARTICLE XVI - ACCESS TO RECORDS (BRMA 1D)

The Reinsurer or its designated representatives shall have access at any
reasonable time to all records of the Company which pertain in any way to this
reinsurance.

ARTICLE XVII - LIABILITY OF THE REINSURER

A.   The liability of the Reinsurer shall follow that of the Company in every
     case and be subject in all respects to all the general and specific
     stipulations, clauses, waivers and modifications of the Company's policies
     and any endorsements thereon. However, in no event shall this be construed
     in any way to provide coverage outside the terms and conditions set forth
     in this Contract.

B.   Nothing herein shall in any manner create any obligations or establish any
     rights against the Reinsurer in favor of any third party or any persons not
     parties to this Contract.

ARTICLE XVIII - NET RETAINED LINES (BRMA 32E)

A.   This Contract applies only to that portion of any policy which the Company
     retains net for its own account (prior to deduction of any underlying
     reinsurance specifically permitted in this Contract), and in calculating
     the amount of any loss hereunder and also in computing the amount or
     amounts in excess of which this Contract attaches, only loss or losses in
     respect

                                                                          (LOGO)


Page 12

<PAGE>

     of that portion of any policy which the Company retains net for its own
     account shall be included.

B.   The amount of the Reinsurer's liability hereunder in respect of any loss or
     losses shall not be increased by reason of the inability of the Company to
     collect from any other reinsurer(s), whether specific or general, any
     amounts which may have become due from such reinsurer(s), whether such
     inability arises from the insolvency of such other reinsurer(s) or
     otherwise.

ARTICLE XIX - ERRORS AND OMISSIONS (BRMA 14F)

Inadvertent delays, errors or omissions made in connection with this Contract or
any transaction hereunder shall not relieve either party from any liability
which would have attached had such delay, error or omission not occurred,
provided always that such error or omission is rectified as soon as possible
after discovery.

ARTICLE XX - CURRENCY (BRMA 12A)

A.   Whenever the word "Dollars" or the "$" sign appears in this Contract, they
     shall be construed to mean United States Dollars and all transactions under
     this Contract shall be in United States Dollars.

B.   Amounts paid or received by the Company in any other currency shall be
     converted to United States Dollars at the rate of exchange at the date such
     transaction is entered on the books of the Company.

ARTICLE XXI - TAXES (BRMA 50C)

In consideration of the terms under which this Contract is issued, the Company
will not claim a deduction in respect of the premium hereon when making tax
returns, other than income or profits tax returns, to any state or territory of
the United States of America, the District of Columbia or Canada.

ARTICLE XXII - FEDERAL EXCISE TAX

A.   The Reinsurer has agreed to allow for the purpose of paying the Federal
     Excise Tax the applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon as
     imposed under Section 4371 of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent such
     premium is subject to the Federal Excise Tax.

B.   In the event of any return of premium becoming due hereunder the Reinsurer
     will deduct the applicable percentage from the return premium payable
     hereon and the Company or its agent should take steps to recover the tax
     from the United States Government.

                                                                          (LOGO)

ARTICLE XXIII - RESERVES

A.   The Reinsurer agrees to fund, within 30 days of the Company's request,
     subject to receipt of satisfactory information from the Company, its share
     of the Company's ceded United States outstanding loss and loss adjustment
     expense reserves (including incurred but not reported loss reserves for
     known loss occurrences established by the Company) by:

     1.   Clean, irrevocable and unconditional letters of credit issued and
          confirmed, if confirmation is required by the insurance regulatory
          authorities involved, by a bank or banks meeting the NAIC Securities
          Valuation Office credit standards for issuers of letters of credit and
          acceptable to said insurance regulatory authorities; and/or

     2.   Escrow accounts for the benefit of the Company; and/or

     3.   Cash advances;

     if the Reinsurer is unauthorized in any state of the United States of
     America or the District of Columbia having jurisdiction over the Company
     and if, without such funding a penalty would accrue to the Company on any
     financial statement, including but not limited to quarterly filings, it is
     required to file with the insurance regulatory authorities involved.

B.   The Reinsurer agrees to fund, within 30 days of the Company's request,
     subject to receipt of satisfactory information from the Company, 115% of
     its share of the Company's Canadian ceded outstanding loss and loss
     adjustment expense reserves (including incurred but not reported loss
     reserves for known loss occurrences established by the Company) by:

     1.   Clean, irrevocable and unconditional letters of credit issued and
          confirmed, if confirmation is required by the insurance regulatory
          authorities involved, by a Canadian bank or banks meeting the NAIC
          Securities Valuation Office credit standards for issuers of letters of
          credit and acceptable to said insurance regulatory authorities, for no
          more than 15/115ths of the total funding required; and/or

     2.   Cash advances for the remaining balance of the funding required;

     if the Reinsurer is unauthorized in any province or jurisdiction of Canada
     having jurisdiction over the Company and if, without such funding, a
     penalty would accrue to the Company on any financial statement, including
     but not limited to quarterly filings, it is required to file with the
     insurance regulatory authorities involved.

C.   The Reinsurer, at its sole option, may fund in other than cash if its
     method of funding is acceptable to the Company and to the insurance
     regulatory authorities involved.

     For the purpose of this Contract, the Lloyd's United States Credit for
     Reinsurance Trust Fund shall be considered an acceptable funding
     instrument.

D.   With regard to funding in whole or in part by letters of credit, it is
     agreed that each letter of credit will be in a form acceptable to insurance
     regulatory authorities involved, will be issued for a term of at least one
     year and will include an "evergreen clause," which automatically extends
     the term for at least one additional year at each expiration date unless
     written notice of non-renewal is given to the Company not less than 30 days
     prior to said expiration date or longer where required by insurance
     regulatory authorities. The Company and the

                                                                          (LOGO)


Page 14

<PAGE>

     Reinsurer further agree, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
     Contract, that said letters of credit may be drawn upon by the Company or
     its successors in interest at any time, without diminution because of the
     insolvency of the Company or the Reinsurer, but only for one or more of the
     following purposes:

     1.   To reimburse itself for the Reinsurer's share of losses and/or loss
          adjustment expense paid under the terms of policies reinsured
          hereunder, unless paid in cash by the Reinsurer;

     2.   To reimburse itself for the Reinsurer's share of any other amounts
          claimed to be due hereunder, unless paid in cash by the Reinsurer;

     3.   To fund a cash account in an amount equal to the Reinsurer's share of
          ceded outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (including
          incurred but not reported loss reserves for known loss occurrences
          established by the Company) funded by means of a letter of credit
          which is under non-renewal notice, if said letter of credit has not
          been renewed or replaced by the Reinsurer 10 days prior to its
          expiration date;

     4.   To refund to the Reinsurer any sum in excess of the actual amount
          required to fund the Reinsurer's share of the Company's ceded
          outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (including
          incurred but not reported loss reserves for known loss occurrences
          established by the Company), if so requested by the Reinsurer.

     In the event the amount drawn by the Company on any letter of credit is in
     excess of the actual amount required for D(1) or D(3), or in the case of
     D(2), the actual amount determined to be due, the Company shall promptly
     return to the Reinsurer the excess amount so drawn.

ARTICLE XXIV - INSOLVENCY

A.   In the event of the insolvency of one or more of the reinsured companies,
     this reinsurance shall be payable directly to the company or to its
     liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of
     the liability of the company without diminution because of the insolvency
     of the company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or
     statutory successor of the company has failed to pay all or a portion of
     any claim. It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver,
     conservator or statutory successor of the company shall give written notice
     to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the company indicating
     the policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability
     on the part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is
     filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership,
     and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate
     such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such
     claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem
     available to the company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or
     statutory successor. The expense thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be
     chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the company as
     part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro
     rata share of the benefit which may accrue to the company solely as a
     result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.

                                                                          (LOGO)


Page 15

<PAGE>

B.   Where two or more reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority
     in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be
     apportioned in accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such
     expense had been incurred by the company.

C.   It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of
     one or more of the reinsured companies, the reinsurance under this Contract
     shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the company or to its
     liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by Section
     4118(a) of the New York Insurance Law or except (1) where this Contract
     specifically provides another payee of such reinsurance in the event of the
     insolvency of the company or (2) where the Reinsurer with the consent of
     the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy obligations of the
     company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such
     policies and in substitution for the obligations of the company to such
     payees.

ARTICLE XXV - ARBITRATION

A.   As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, any dispute or
     difference between the Company and any Reinsurer relating to the
     interpretation or performance of this Contract, including its formation or
     validity, or any transaction under this Contract, whether arising before or
     after termination, shall be submitted to arbitration.

B.   If more than one reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such
     reinsurers shall constitute and act as one party for purposes of this
     Article provided that communication shall be made by the Company to each of
     the reinsurers constituting the one party, and provided, however, that
     nothing therein shall impair the rights of such reinsurers to assert
     several, rather than joint, defenses or claims, nor be construed as
     changing the liability of the Reinsurer under the terms of this Contract
     from several to joint.

C.   Upon written request of any party, each party shall choose an arbitrator
     and the two chosen shall select a third arbitrator. If either party refuses
     or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days after receipt of the
     written request for arbitration, the requesting party may appoint a second
     arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to agree on the selection of a
     third arbitrator within 30 days of their appointment, the Company shall
     petition the American Arbitration Association to appoint the third
     arbitrator. If the American Arbitration Association fails to appoint the
     third arbitrator within 30 days after it has been requested to do so,
     either party may request a justice of a court of general jurisdiction of
     the state in which the arbitration is to be held to appoint the third
     arbitrator. All arbitrators shall be active or retired officers of
     insurance or reinsurance companies, or Lloyd's London Underwriters, and
     disinterested in the outcome of the arbitration. Each party shall submit
     its case to the arbitrators within 30 days of the appointment of the third
     arbitrator.

D.   The parties hereby waive all objections to the method of selection of the
     arbitrators, it being the intention of both sides that all the arbitrators
     be chosen from those submitted by the parties.

E.   The arbitrators shall have the power to determine all procedural rules for
     the holding of the arbitration including but not limited to inspection of
     documents, examination of witnesses and any other matter relating to the
     conduct of the arbitration. The arbitrators shall interpret this Contract
     as an honorable engagement and not as merely a legal obligation; they are
     relieved of all judicial formalities and may abstain from following the
     strict rules of law. The

                                                                          (LOGO)


Page 16

<PAGE>

     arbitrators may award interest and costs. Each party shall bear the expense
     of its own arbitrator and shall share equally with the other party the
     expenses of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration.

F.   The decision in writing of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final
     and binding upon both parties. Judgment may be entered upon the final
     decision of the arbitrators in any court having jurisdiction. The
     arbitration shall take place in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, unless otherwise
     mutually agreed between the Company and the Reinsurer.

G.   This Article shall remain in full force and effect in the event any other
     provision of this Contract shall be found invalid or non-binding.

H.   All time limitations stated in this Article may be amended by mutual
     consent of the parties, and will be amended automatically to the extent
     made necessary by any circumstances beyond the control of the parties.

ARTICLE XXVI - SERVICE OF SUIT

(Applicable if the Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America,
and/or is not authorized in any State, Territory or District of the United
States where authorization is required by insurance regulatory authorities. This
Article is not intended to conflict with or override the parties obligations to
arbitrate their disputes in accordance with Article XXV.)

A.   It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount
     claimed to be due hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company,
     will submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within
     the United States. Nothing in this Article constitutes or should be
     understood to constitute a waiver of the Reinsurer's rights to commence an
     action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to
     remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer
     of a case to another court as permitted by the laws of the United States or
     of any state in the United States.

B.   Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the
     United States which makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby
     designates the party named in its Interests and Liabilities Agreement, or
     if no party is named therein, the Superintendent, Commissioner or Director
     of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the statute, or
     his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon
     whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding
     instituted by or on behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder
     arising out of this Contract.

ARTICLE XXVII - AGENCY AGREEMENT

If more than one reinsured company is named as a party to this Contract, the
first named company shall be deemed the agent of the other reinsured companies
for purposes of sending or receiving notices required by the terms and
conditions of this Contract, and for purposes of remitting or receiving any
monies due any party.

                                                                          (LOGO)

ARTICLE XXVIII - GOVERNING LAW

This Contract shall be governed as to performance, administration and
interpretation by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania exclusive of the rules
with respect to conflicts of law, except as to rules with respect to credit for
reinsurance in which case the applicable rules of all the states shall apply.

ARTICLE XXIX - CONFIDENTIALITY

The Reinsurer, except with the express prior written consent of the Company,
shall not directly or indirectly communicate, disclose or divulge to any third
party any knowledge or information that may be acquired either directly or
indirectly as a result of the inspection of the Company's books, records and
papers. The restrictions as outlined in this Article shall not apply to
communication or disclosures that the Reinsurer is required to make to its
statutory auditors, retrocessionaires, legal counsel, arbitrators involved in
any arbitration procedures under this Contract or disclosures required upon
subpoena or other duly-issued order of a court or other governmental agency or
regulatory authority.

ARTICLE XXX - SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Contract should be invalid under applicable laws, the
latter shall control but only to the extent of the conflict without affecting
the remaining provisions of this Contract.

for all business hereunder. All communications (including but not limited to
notices, statements, premium, return premium, commissions, taxes, losses, loss
adjustment expense, salvages and loss settlements) relating thereto shall be
transmitted to the Company or the Reinsurer through Benfield Inc. Payments by
the Company to the Intermediary shall be deemed to constitute payment to the
Reinsurer. Payments by the Reinsurer to the Intermediary shall be deemed to
constitute payment to the Company only to the extent that such payments are
actually received by the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company by its duly authorized representative has
executed this Contract as of the date undermentioned at:

Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, this 28th day of July in the year 2005.

     Atomic or Nuclear Energy risks.

2.   Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph (1) of this
     Clause, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss or liability accruing to

     from any insurance against Physical Damage (including business interruption
     or consequential loss arising out of such Physical Damage) to:

     I.   Nuclear reactor power plants including all auxiliary property on the
          site, or

     II.  Any other nuclear reactor installation, including laboratories
          handling radioactive materials in connection with reactor
          installations, and "critical facilities" as such, or

     III. Installations for fabricating complete fuel elements or for processing
          substantial quantities of "special nuclear material," and for

     using radioactive isotopes in any form where the nuclear exposure is not
     considered by the Reassured to be the primary hazard.

6.   The term "special nuclear material" shall have the meaning given it in the
     Atomic Energy Act of 1954 or by any law amendatory thereof.

          shall be free from the application of the other provisions of this
          Clause until expiry date or 31st December 1960 whichever first occurs

     (b)  with respect to any risk located in Canada policies issued by the
          Reassured on or before 31st December 1958 shall be free from the
          application of the other provisions of this Clause until expiry date

occurrence commenced may not be included in the Ultimate Net Loss hereunder.

1.   ELECTRONIC DATA EXCLUSION

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary within the Contract or any
     endorsement thereto, it is understood and agreed as follows:-

     a)   This Contract does not insure loss, damage, destruction, distortion,
          erasure, corruption or alteration of ELECTRONIC DATA from any cause
          whatsoever (including but not limited to COMPUTER VIRUS) or loss of
          use, reduction in functionality, cost, expense of whatsoever nature
          resulting therefrom, regardless of any other cause or event
          contributing concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss.

          ELECTRONIC DATA means facts, concepts and information converted to a
          form useable for communications, interpretation or processing by
          electronic and electromechanical data processing or electronically
          controlled equipment and includes programs, software and other coded
          instructions for the processing and manipulation of data or the
          direction and manipulation of such equipment.

          COMPUTER VIRUS means a set of corrupting, harmful or otherwise
          unauthorized instructions or code including a set of maliciously
          introduced unauthorized instructions or code, programmatic or
          otherwise, that propagate themselves through a computer system or
          network of whatsoever nature. COMPUTER VIRUS includes but is not
          limited to "Trojan Horses," "worms" and "time or logic bombs."

     b)   However, in the event that a peril listed below results from any of
          the matters described in paragraph a) above, this Contract, subject to
          all its terms, conditions and exclusions, will cover physical damage
          occurring during the Contract period to property insured by this
          Contract directly caused by such listed peril.

2.   ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING MEDIA VALUATION

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary within the Contract or any
     endorsement thereto, it is understood and agreed as follows:-

     Should electronic data processing media insured by this Contract suffer
     physical loss or damage insured by this Contract, then the basis of
     valuation shall be the cost of the blank media plus the costs of copying
     the ELECTRONIC DATA from back-up or from originals of a previous
     generation. These costs will not include research and engineering nor any
     costs of recreating, gathering or assembling such ELECTRONIC DATA. If the
     media is not repaired, replaced or restored the basis of valuation shall be
     the cost of the blank media. However this Contract does not insure any
     amount pertaining to the value of such ELECTRONIC DATA to the Assured or
     any other party, even if such ELECTRONIC DATA cannot be recreated, gathered
     or assembled.
