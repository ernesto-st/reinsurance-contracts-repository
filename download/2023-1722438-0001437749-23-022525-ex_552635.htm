Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed of such Third Party Claim, including providing copies of material notices and documents (including court papers) that are not subject to any legal privilege and were provided by the claimant in such Third Party Claim received by the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party Claim.</p>

If the Indemnitor is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor shall control such defense; <u>provided</u>, that if the Indemnitor assumes control of such defense the Indemnitor must first acknowledge that it would have an indemnity obligation for Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim as provided under this <u>ARTICLE IX</u>. The Indemnitor shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all of the Parties shall, and shall instruct their respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof (subject to any applicable legal privilege or the attorney work-product doctrine). Such cooperation shall be at the Indemnitor&#8217;s sole cost and expense and shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitor&#8217;s request) the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder (in each case, subject to any applicable legal privilege or the attorney work-product doctrine). If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this <u>Section 9.7(b)</u>, then so long as the Indemnitor is defending in good faith any such Third Party Claim (and is otherwise in compliance with this <u>Section 9.7(b)</u>), the Indemnitee shall not pay, settle, compromise, or discharge such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this <u>Section 9.7(b)</u>, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise, or discharge such Third Party Claim with the Indemnitee&#8217;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed); <u>provided</u>, that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise, or discharge such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (1) includes, as a condition to any such settlement or compromise, a general release of the Indemnitee and its Affiliates from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (2) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other non-monetary remedy, (3) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability, Liability, violation of Law or the rights of any Person by Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, and (4) provides for the payment by the Indemnitor of monetary damages as the sole relief for the claimant(s) in such Third Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this <u>Section 9.7(b)</u> or following the Indemnitor&#8217;s assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this <u>Section 9.7(b)</u> any of the conditions set forth in this <u>Section 9.7(b)</u> becomes unsatisfied with respect to such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitee may assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim to the entire exclusion (including with respect to the settlement or compromise of, or entry of judgment in, such Third Party Claim) and at the entire expense of the Indemnitor.</p>

The arbitration, including the arbitration award, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. &#167; 1 et seq.), and judgment upon the award may be confirmed and entered by any court having competent jurisdiction over the Parties or their assets. The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that they deem just and equitable, including but not limited to orders of specific performance as set out in <u>Section 10.10</u>, the equitable remedies available under <u>Section 6.5(c)</u>, or any other injunctive or equitable relief, whether interim and/or final, and any provisional measures ordered by the arbitrator(s) may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
