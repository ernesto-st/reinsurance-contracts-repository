          (a)     TERM LOAN A; TERM LOAN B. Each Existing Lender, severally and
for itself alone, hereby agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth and in reliance upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, that, effective on the Closing

pursuant to SECTION 12.20(b), obligations that are currently due under any of
the Borrower's or any Restricted Subsidiary's Interest Rate Agreements that have
been terminated (and are not reinstated or otherwise effective) may, at the

Lenders for purposes of the first sentence of this SECTION 2.1(a) and as Lenders
hereunder, and (b) the obligations under such Interest Rate Agreements shall be

Obligations, it being understood that the Existing L/C Obligations shall be on
the Closing Date deemed outstanding pursuant to, and shall constitute "Letters
of Credit" for all purposes of, the Priority Credit Agreement.

          (c)     TERM LOANS. The Term Loans shall initially be Base Rate Loans
or Eurodollar Rate Loans to the extent agreed to by the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders but thereafter may from time to time be (i) Eurodollar Loans, (ii)
Base Rate Loans, or (iii) a combination thereof, as determined by Borrower and
notified to Administrative Agent in accordance with SECTION 2.3; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (i) at no time shall there be outstanding more than ten (10)
Interest Periods with respect to Tranches of Eurodollar Loans for each of the
Term A Loans and Term B Loans and (ii) an amount of Term Loans satisfactory to
Administrative Agent shall be maintained as Base Rate Loans for a time period
satisfactory to Administrative Agent of up to 10 Business Days following the

authorized to record the initial type and amount of each portion of such Loan,
each continuation thereof, each conversion of all or a portion thereof to
another Type, the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal
thereof and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the length of each Interest Period
with respect thereto, on the schedule annexed to and constituting a part of its
Term Note (or otherwise on the records of such Lender), and any such recordation
shall (in the absence of manifest error) constitute prima facie evidence of the
accuracy of the information so recorded; provided, however, that the failure of
a Lender to make any such recordation (or any error in such recordation) on its
records or on its Term Note shall not affect the obligations of Borrower
thereunder or under this Agreement. Each Term Note shall (x) be dated the
Closing Date, (y) be stated to mature on the Maturity Date and (z) provide for
the payment of interest in accordance with SECTION 3.1 and the payment of
principal on the Maturity Date.

          2.3     CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION ELECTIONS FOR EURODOLLAR LOANS AND

          (b)     If Borrower desires to convert or continue any Eurodollar Loan
or Base Rate Loan pursuant to SECTION 2.3(a), it shall irrevocably request a
conversion or continuation (if by telephone, to be confirmed promptly in
writing) in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation in the form of EXHIBIT 2.3(b)
(a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION") to be received by Administrative
Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least (i) three Business
Days in advance of the Conversion Date or Continuation Date, if the Loans are to
be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Loans; and (ii) on the same
Business Day as the Conversion Date, if the Loans are to be converted into Base
Rate Loans, specifying:

are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Loans; and

          (E)     whether such Loans are a part of the Term A Loans or the
Term B Loans.

          (c)     If prior to the time set forth in SECTION 2.3(b), (i) Borrower
has failed to give a timely Notice of Conversion or Continuation with respect to
a Eurodollar Loan, or (ii) Borrower has failed to select a new Interest Period
to be applicable to a Eurodollar Loan, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected
to continue such loan as a Eurodollar Loan with an Interest Period of one month.

          (d)     Upon receipt of a Notice of Conversion or Continuation,
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender thereof, or, if
no timely notice is provided, Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
applicable Lender of the details of any automatic conversion or continuation.
Each conversion or continuation of Term Loans shall be allocated among Term
Loans of the Term Lenders, in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.

          (e)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be entitled
to specify or elect in any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or
Continuation that any Loans shall be or become Eurodollar Loans if an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing unless the Required Lenders shall
have notified Administrative Agent that additional Eurodollar Loans shall be
made available while such Event of Default is continuing. If an Event of Default
shall occur then, unless Administrative Agent shall receive such notice from the
Required Lenders or all Events of Default have been cured or waived, each
outstanding Eurodollar Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last
day of its Interest Period. The foregoing is without prejudice to the other
rights and remedies available hereunder upon an Event of Default.

shall be payable from time to time on demand. Interest shall also be payable on
the date of any prepayment of the Term Loans for the portion of the Loans so
prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full of all of the Loans.

          (c)     NOTIFICATION OF RATE. Administrative Agent, upon determining
the interest rate for any Tranche of Eurodollar Loans for any Interest Period,
shall promptly notify Borrower and the applicable Lenders thereof. Such
determination shall, absent manifest error and subject to SECTION 3.5, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

          (d)     DEFAULT INTEREST. Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified herein, effective on the date 30 days after the occurrence and
continuance during such 30 day period of any Event of Default (other than the
failure to pay Obligations when due) and for so long thereafter as any such
Event of Default shall be continuing, and effective immediately upon any failure
to pay any Obligations or any other amounts due under any of the Loan Documents
when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, the principal balance of each
Loan then outstanding and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any
interest payment on each Loan not paid when due or other amounts then due and
payable, shall bear interest payable on demand, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

          (e)     MAXIMUM INTEREST. If any interest payment or other charge or
fee payable hereunder exceeds the maximum amount then permitted by applicable
law, Borrower shall be obligated to pay the maximum amount then permitted by
applicable law and Borrower shall continue to pay the maximum amount from time
to time permitted by applicable law until all such interest payments and other
charges and fees otherwise due hereunder (in the absence of such restraint
imposed by applicable law) have been paid in full.

          (f)     WAIVER OF ACCRUED DEFAULT INTEREST. Each Lender hereby waives
and discharges the obligation of Borrower to pay to such Lender that portion of
interest representing the Default Rate Margin accrued and payable to such Lender
under the Original Credit Agreement and the Original Term Loan Agreement through
and including the Closing Date.

          3.2     FEES

          (a)     UPFRONT FEES. In the event that this Agreement becomes
effective pursuant to SECTION 12.20(a), Borrower shall pay to Administrative
Agent on the Closing Date for the account of each Lender a commitment fee equal
to 1.0 % of such Lender's Term Loans as of the Closing Date. In the event that
this Agreement becomes effective pursuant to and in accordance with
SECTION 12.20(b), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent on the Closing Date
for the account of each Lender a commitment fee equal to .25% of such Lender's
Term Loans as of the Closing Date.

          (b)     TERM B LOAN SUPPLEMENTAL FEE. If (i) this Agreement becomes
effective pursuant to SECTION 12.20(a) and the Minimum Term B Prepayment is not
made on or before May 31, 2003 or (ii) this Agreement becomes effective pursuant
to SECTION 12.20(b) and the Minimum Term B Prepayment is not made on or before
the date which is one year after the Closing Date, then no later than the first
Business Day after May 31, 2003, or the first Business Day after the date which
is one year after the Closing Date, as the case may be (the

                                       38
<Page>

"SUPPLEMENTAL FEE PAYMENT DATE"), the Borrower shall pay to each Term B Lender a
fee equal to two percent (2%) of the principal amount of such Lender's Term B
Loan on such date by adding such amount to the then outstanding principal
balance of such Lender's Term B Loan. On the Supplemental Fee Payment Date the
principal amount of each Term B Lender's Term B Loan shall without further
action by the Borrower or such Lender increase by two percent (2%) and
thereafter all references hereunder to the Term B Loan of such Lender shall,
unless the context clearly requires otherwise, mean the principal amount as so
adjusted. At the request of any Term B Lender, the Borrower will deliver a Term
B Note (the "PIK B Note") which Note will be identical to the Term B Note
attached hereto as EXHIBIT 2.2(b), except that such Note will be dated the
Supplemental Fee Payment Date.

          3.3     COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

          (a)     Interest on all Eurodollar Loans and all fees hereunder shall
be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days. Interest on all Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be. Each determination of an interest rate by Administrative Agent pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower and
the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. Administrative Agent shall, at any
time and from time to time upon request of Borrower or any Lender, deliver to
Borrower or any Lender a statement showing the quotations used by Administrative
Agent in determining any interest rate applicable to Loans pursuant to this
Agreement.

          3.4     COMPENSATION FOR FUNDING LOSSES.

          Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which
request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts, showing the
calculation thereof in reasonable detail), for all losses, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any interest paid by such Lender to
lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Loans to the extent not
recovered by the Lender in connection with the liquidation or reemployment of
such funds and including the compensation payable by such Lender to a Person to
which the Lender has participated all or a portion of such Loan) and any loss
sustained by such Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of
such funds (including, without limitation, a return on such liquidation or
re-employment that would result in such Lender receiving less than it would have
received had such Loan remained outstanding until the last day of the Interest
Period applicable to such Loans) which the Lender may sustain as a result of:
(i) for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or Administrative Agent)
a continuation of, or conversion from or into, Eurodollar Loans does not occur
on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Conversion or Continuation (whether
or not withdrawn); (ii) any payment, prepayment or conversion or continuation of
any of its Eurodollar Loans occurring for any reason whatsoever on a date which
is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) any
repayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans not being made on the date specified in
a notice of payment given by Borrower; or (iv)(A) any other failure by Borrower
to repay its Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or
(B) an election made by Borrower pursuant to SECTION 3.6. Each Lender shall
submit its written request as to additional amounts owed such Lender under this
SECTION 3.4 to Borrower and Administrative Agent within ten Business Days of the
event

                                       39
<Page>

giving rise to such request, which request shall, absent manifest error, be
final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.

          3.5     INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY, ETC.

          (a)     GENERALLY. Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 4.5, in the
event that any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but,
with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by Administrative Agent):

                  (i)    on any Interest Rate Determination Date that, by reason
     of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the
     interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
     ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
     definition of the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan for the
     applicable Interest Period, then, the obligation of the Lenders to convert,
     continue or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended until
     Administrative Agent revokes such notice thereof in writing;

                  (ii)   at any time that any Lender shall incur increased costs
     or reduction in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect
     to any Eurodollar Loan because of any change since the date of this
     Agreement in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order,
     guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the
     interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of
     any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request,
     such as, for example, but not limited to (A) a change in the basis of
     taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on the
     Notes or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for (a) changes in the
     rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or profits of
     such Lender imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal office or
     applicable lending office is located and (b) USA withholding taxes, which
     shall be governed by the provisions of SECTION 4.5) or (B) a change in
     official reserve requirements (but, in all events, excluding reserves
     required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of
     the Eurodollar Rate) and/or (y) other circumstances since the date of this
     Agreement affecting such Lender or the interbank Eurodollar market or the
     position of such Lender in such market (excluding, however, differences in
     a Lender's cost of funds from those of Administrative Agent which are
     solely the result of credit differences between such Lender and
     Administrative Agent); or

                  (iii)  at any time that continuance of or conversion to any
     Eurodollar Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule,
     regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in good
     faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of law) or
     (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date of
     this Agreement which materially and adversely affects the interbank
     Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or Administrative Agent in the case of
clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone, telefax or
telecopier confirmed in writing) to Borrower and, except in the case of clause
(i) above, to Administrative Agent of such

                                       40
<Page>

determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each
of the other Lenders). Thereafter (A) in the case of clause (i) above,
Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as Administrative
Agent notifies Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to
such notice by Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of
Conversion or Continuation given by Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans
(other than with respect to conversions to Base Rate Loans) which have not yet
been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by
Borrower, (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, Borrower shall pay to such
Lender, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an
increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise
as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to
compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts
received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts
owed to such Lender, showing the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to
Borrower by such Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive
and binding on all the parties hereto; however the failure to give any such
notice shall not release or diminish Borrower's obligations to pay additional
amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(a); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the respective
Lender has intentionally withheld or delayed such notice, the respective Lender
shall not be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION
3.5(a) for periods occurring prior to the 180th day before the giving of such
written demand) and (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, Borrower shall take
one of the actions specified in SECTION 3.5(b) as promptly as possible and, in
any event, within the time period required by law. In determining such
additional amounts pursuant to clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence,
each Lender shall act reasonably and in good faith and will, to the extent the
increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable relate to such Lender's
loans in general and are not specifically attributable to a Loan hereunder, use
averaging and attribution methods which are reasonable and which cover all loans
similar to the Loans made by such Lender whether or not the loan documentation
for such other loans permits the Lender to receive increased costs of the type
described in this SECTION 3.5(a).

          (b)     EURODOLLAR LOANS. At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is
affected by the circumstances described in SECTION 3.5(a)(ii) or (iii), Borrower
may (and, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected by the circumstances
described in SECTION 3.5(a)(iii), shall) if any affected Loan is a Eurodollar
Loan then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to
Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar
Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided that if more than one Lender is affected at
any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the same pursuant to this
SECTION 3.5(b).

          (c)     CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If, at any time after the date hereof,
any Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in any applicable
law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or
not having the force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's Loans hereunder
or its obligations hereunder, then Borrower shall pay to such Lender, upon its
delivery of the written notice hereafter referred to, therefor, such additional
amounts as shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation
for the increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction
in the rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of
such increase of

                                       41
<Page>

capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably
and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are
reasonable and which will, to the extent the increased costs or reduction in the
rate of return relates to such Lender's commitments or obligations in general
and are not specifically attributable to the obligations hereunder, cover all
commitments and obligations similar to the obligations of such Lender hereunder
whether or not the loan documentation for such other commitments or obligations
permits the Lender to make the determination specified in this SECTION 3.5(c),
and such Lender's determination of compensation owing under this SECTION 3.5(c)
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the
parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will
be payable pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(c) will give prompt written notice
thereof to Borrower, which notice shall show the basis for calculation of such
additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not
release or diminish any of Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts
pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the respective Lender has
intentionally withheld or delayed such notice, the respective Lender shall not
be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.5(c) for
periods occurring prior to the 180th day before the giving of such notice.

          (d)     EFFECT OF RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. In the event that any
Governmental Authority shall impose any Eurodollar Reserve Requirements which
increase the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, then
Borrower shall thereafter pay in respect of the Term Loans of such Lender a rate
of interest based upon the Eurodollar Reserve Rate (rather than upon the
Eurodollar Rate). From and after the delivery by a Lender to Borrower of a
notice indicating that the cost to any Lender has increased as a result of such
Eurodollar Reserve Requirement, all references contained in this Agreement to
the Eurodollar Rate (other than that in the definition of Eurodollar Reserve
Rate) shall be deemed to be references to the Eurodollar Reserve Rate with
respect to each such affected Lender.

          3.6     REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

          If any Lender is owed increased costs under SECTION 3.5(a)(ii) or
(iii) or SECTION 3.5(c) or Borrower is required to make any payments under
SECTION 4.5(c) to any Lender materially in excess of those of the other Lenders
or as provided in SECTION 12.1(b) in the case of certain refusals by a Lender to
consent to certain proposed amendment, changes, supplements, waivers, discharges
or terminations with respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the
Required Lenders, Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event of
Default then exists, to replace such Lender (the "REPLACED LENDER") with one or
more other Eligible Assignee or Assignees (collectively, the "REPLACEMENT
LENDER") acceptable to Administrative Agent, or, at the option of the Borrower,
in the case of a replacement as provided in SECTION 12.1(b) where the consent of
the respective Lender is required with respect to less than all of its Loans, to
replace only the affected Loans with identical Loans provided by the Replacement
Lender; PROVIDED that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this
SECTION 3.6, the Replaced Lender and Replacement Lender shall enter into one or
more assignment agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to such parties
and Administrative Agent, pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire
all or a portion, as the case may be, of the outstanding Loans of the Replaced
Lender and (ii) all obligations of Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender
relating to the Loans so replaced (including, without limitation, such increased
costs and excluding those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect
of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is

                                       42
<Page>

concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective
assignment documentation, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the
Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by Borrower, the
Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall
cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such replaced Loans, except with
respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive
as to such Replaced Lender. The Replaced Lender shall be required to deliver for
cancellation its Notes to be cancelled on the date of replacement, or if any
such Note is lost or unavailable, such other assurances or indemnification
therefor as Borrower may reasonably request.

          3.7     CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE.

          Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise
to increased costs or other special payments under SECTIONS 3.5(a)(ii) and
(iii), SECTION 3.5(c) or SECTION 4.5(c) with respect to such Lender, it will, if
requested by Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Lender) to designate another Lending Office for any Loans
affected by such event, PROVIDED that such designation is made on such terms
that, such Lender and its Lending Office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving
rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this SECTION 3.7 shall affect
or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender
provided in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                            PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS

          4.1     VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS.

          Borrower shall have the right to prepay any Loan in whole or in part
from time to time on the following terms and conditions: (i) Borrower shall give
an irrevocable written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) to Administrative Agent, which such notice shall state Borrower's
intent to prepay such Loans, the amount of such prepayment and the Loans to
which such prepayment is to be applied, which notice shall be given by Borrower
to Administrative Agent by 12:00 Noon (New York City time) at least three
Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment if a prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans or one Business Day for any other Loans and which notice shall promptly be
transmitted by Administrative Agent to each of the applicable Lenders; (ii) each
partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount of
at least $1,000,000; (iii) Eurodollar Loans may only be prepaid pursuant to this
SECTION 4.1 on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or on any
other day subject to SECTION 3.4; and (iv) a partial prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans shall not be made that would result in the remaining aggregate outstanding
principal amount thereof being less than the minimum principal amount that would
be required in respect of a similar Eurodollar Loans. Voluntary prepayments of
Term Loans shall be applied first to the Term A Loans, with up to 50% of such
prepayment applied pro rata to the Scheduled Term A Loan Principal Payments to
be made within the twelve-month period following the date of such prepayment and
the remaining portion of such prepayments shall be applied in inverse order of
maturity. The notice

                                       43
<Page>

provisions, the provisions with respect to the minimum amount of any prepayment
and the provisions requiring prepayments in integral multiples above such
minimum amount are for the benefit of Administrative Agent and may be waived
unilaterally by Administrative Agent.

          4.2     MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

          (a)     SCHEDULED TERM LOANS PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. Borrower shall cause
to be paid Scheduled Term A Loans Principal Payments on the Term A Loans until
the Term A Loans are paid in full in the amounts and at the times specified in
the definition of Scheduled Term A Loans Principal Payments to the extent that
prepayments have not previously been applied to such Scheduled Term A Loans
Principal Payments (and such Scheduled Term A Loans Principal Payments have not
otherwise been reduced) pursuant to the terms hereof. Borrower shall cause to be
paid on the Term B Loan Maturity Date all outstanding Term B Loans.

          (b)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON CERTAIN SALES. If Borrower, HSCHC,
HSCC or any of Borrower's Restricted Subsidiaries receives any Net Sale Proceeds
attributable to any Asset Disposition, then to the extent such Net Sale
Proceeds, together with the Net Sale Proceeds of all other Asset Dispositions
occurring in such Fiscal Year exceed $15,000,000 ("EXCESS NET SALE PROCEEDS"),
Borrower shall on such date repay the Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to
100% of such Excess Net Sale Proceeds; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in addition to
the foregoing, the Borrower shall be permitted to retain up to $10,000,000 in
the aggregate of the Net Sale Proceeds resulting from one or more Asset
Dispositions described on SCHEDULE 4.2(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of this SECTION 4.2(b), the Net Sale Proceeds attributable to any Asset
Disposition shall not include such proceeds to the extent (i) such proceeds are
directly attributable to the sale or transfer of accounts receivables or
inventory comprising a portion of the "Borrowing Base," as such term is defined
in the Priority Credit Agreement and (ii) an adjustment to such "Borrowing Base"
is made on the date of such Asset Disposition pursuant to Section 4.5(e) of the
Priority Credit Agreement. All prepayments of principal hereunder made by
Borrower pursuant to this SECTION 4.2(b) shall be applied in the manner set
forth in SECTION 4.3.

          (c)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT WITH EXCESS CASH FLOW. As soon as
practicable, and in any event by April 30th of each Fiscal Year, (A) Borrower
shall calculate the Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year and (B) Borrower shall
make a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans in an amount equal to (i) one
hundred percent (100%) or (ii) after the Minimum Term B Prepayment is made,
seventy-five percent (75%) of such Excess Cash Flow ("TOTAL PREPAYMENT AMOUNT").
All prepayments of principal made hereunder made by Borrower pursuant to this
SECTION 4.2(c) shall be applied first to the Term A Loans, with up to 50% of
such prepayment applied pro rata to the Scheduled Term A Loan Principal Payments
to be made within the twelve-month period following the date of such prepayment
and the remaining portion of such prepayments shall be applied in inverse order
of maturity.

          (d)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT WITH PROCEEDS OF CAPITAL STOCK. If
Holdco I, Holdco II, Borrower, any of Borrower's Restricted Subsidiaries, HSCHC
or HSCC receives any Net Offering Proceeds from any offering of Capital Stock or
contribution to capital after the Closing Date, other than the Permitted
Mezzanine Proceeds, Borrower shall on the date of the receipt by such Person of
such proceeds prepay the Term Loans in an amount equal to such Net

                                       44
<Page>

Offering Proceeds. All prepayments of principal hereunder made by Borrower
pursuant to this SECTION 4.2(d) shall be applied in the manner set forth in
SECTION 4.3.

          (e)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT WITH PROCEEDS OF PERMITTED JUNIOR DEBT.
No later than the Business Day of receipt by Borrower of the cash proceeds (net
of underwriting discounts, similar placement fees and commissions and other
reasonable costs and expenses associated therewith) from the issuance of any
Permitted Junior Debt of Borrower, Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans in an
aggregate amount equal to such net cash proceeds. All prepayments of principal
hereunder made by Borrower pursuant to this SECTION 4.2(e) shall be applied in
the manner set forth in SECTION 4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that Borrower shall have made the Minimum Term B Prepayment, Borrower may retain
an amount of proceeds of Permitted Junior Debt not greater than the then current
outstanding principal amount of Polymers Senior Notes (the "PERMITTED POLYMERS
NOTES REPURCHASE AMOUNT") solely for the purpose of purchasing and/or redeeming
any outstanding Polymers Senior Notes (the "PURCHASED POLYMERS NOTES") from the
holders thereof at a purchase or redemption price less than or equal to the par
value of the Polymers Senior Notes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) pending
application of the Permitted Polymers Notes Repurchase Amount in the manner
permitted hereunder, the Permitted Polymers Notes Repurchase Amount shall be
promptly applied by Borrower to reduce the Loans outstanding under the Priority
Credit Agreement or, if there shall be no Loans outstanding under the Priority
Credit Agreement, such funds shall be promptly deposited into the Borrower's
operating account at DB. All Purchased Polymers Notes shall, promptly following
their being purchased or redeemed by Borrower hereunder, be cancelled and
extinguished. In the event that the aggregate purchase price for such Polymers
Senior Notes (whether purchased or redeemed) is less than the Permitted Polymers
Notes Repurchase Amount, Borrower shall promptly, but in no event later than
December 2, 2004 prepay the Term Loans in an amount equal to such difference.

          (f)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT WITH PROCEEDS OF OTHER DEBT. No later
than the Business Day following receipt by Holdco I, Holdco II, Borrower, any of
Borrower's Restricted Subsidiaries, HSCHC or HSCC of the cash proceeds (net of
underwriting discounts, similar placement fees and commissions, and other
reasonable costs and expenses associated therewith) from the issuance or
incurrence of Indebtedness (other than Permitted Mezzanine Proceeds and the
proceeds of Indebtedness which is expressly permitted under SECTION 8.2 hereof),
Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans in an amount equal to such net cash
proceeds. All prepayments of principal made by Borrower pursuant to this SECTION
4.2(f) shall be applied in the manner set forth in SECTION 4.3.

          (g)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL. Simultaneously
with any Change of Control, Borrower shall prepay, in full, the outstanding
principal amount of any outstanding Loans, together with all accrued interest,
fees and other expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders as a
result of such Change in Control and prepayment.

          (h)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT UPON RECOVERY EVENT. Within two (2)
Business Days following each date on which Borrower or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries receives any proceeds from any Recovery Event, an amount equal to
100% of the proceeds of such Recovery Event (net of taxes and reasonable costs
incurred in connection with such Recovery Event) shall be applied as a mandatory
prepayment of principal of the Term Loans,

                                       45
<Page>

applied in the manner set forth in SECTION 4.3, provided that (1) so long as no
Event of Default then exists, if the net proceeds from any single or series of
related Recovery Events are less than $5,000,000, then no prepayment shall be
required pursuant to this SECTION 4.2(h), and (2) so long as no Event of Default
then exists, with respect to any single or series of related Recovery Events the
net proceeds therefrom which are equal to or greater than $5,000,000 but less
than 10% of net property, plant or equipment as set forth on the most recently
delivered quarterly financial statements of Borrower (the "THRESHOLD"), such
proceeds shall not be required to be so applied on such date to the extent that
(x) Borrower has delivered a certificate to the Administrative Agent on or prior
to such date stating that such proceeds shall be used to replace or restore any
properties or assets in respect of which such proceeds were paid within 365 days
following the date of the receipt of such proceeds (which certificate shall set
forth the estimates of the proceeds to be so expended) and (y) such proceeds are
deposited in an escrow account with the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Secured Parties (the "RECOVERY EVENT ESCROW ACCOUNT") or, with consent of
the Administrative Agent, are applied to the outstanding Priority Loans with a
reserve established for usage of such amounts in accordance with this SECTION
4.2(h), from which escrow account (or revolver reserve) amounts may be withdrawn
only to repay the Loans or to be used for the purposes described in clause (x)
above; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that

                  (i)    if the amount of such proceeds from any single or
     series of related Recovery Events exceeds the Threshold, then the entire
     amount and not just the portion in excess of the Threshold shall be applied
     as a mandatory repayment of Term Loans as provided above in this SECTION
     4.2(h),

                  (ii)   if all or any portion of such proceeds not required to
     be applied to the repayment of Term Loans pursuant to the first proviso of
     this SECTION 4.2(h) are not so used (or contractually committed to be used)
     within 365 days after the day of the receipt of such proceeds, such
     remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of such period as a
     mandatory repayment of principal of the Term Loan as provided in this
     SECTION 4.2(h);

                  (iii)  if all or any portion of such proceeds are not required
     to be applied on the 365th day referred to in clause (ii) above because
     such amount is contractually committed to be used and subsequent to such
     date such contract is terminated or expires without such portion being so
     used, then such remaining portion shall be applied on the date of such
     termination or expiration as a mandatory repayment of principal of
     outstanding Term Loans as provided in this SECTION 4.2(h); and

                  (iv)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
     SECTION 4.2(h), the proceeds of any Recovery Event shall not include such
     proceeds to the extent (i) such proceeds are directly attributable to
     inventory or any other component comprising a portion of the "Borrowing
     Base," as such term is defined in the Priority Credit Agreement and (ii) an
     adjustment to such "Borrowing Base" is made on the date of the event giving
     rise to the Recovery Event pursuant to Section 4.5(g) of the Priority
     Credit Agreement.

          (i)     WAIVER OF CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS BY TERM LENDERS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this SECTION 4.2(i) or
elsewhere in this

                                       46
<Page>

Agreement (including, without limitation, in SECTION 12.1), Borrower shall have
the option, in its sole discretion, to give the Term Lenders the option to waive
a mandatory prepayment of such Term Loans pursuant to SECTION 4.2(b), (c), (d),
(e), (f) and (h) (each such repayment, a "WAIVABLE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT") upon
the terms and provisions set forth in this SECTION 4.2(i). If Borrower elects to
exercise the option referred to in the preceding sentence, Borrower shall give
to Administrative Agent written notice of its intention to give the Term Lenders
the right to waive a Waivable Mandatory Prepayment at least five (5) Business
Days prior to such repayment which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly
forward to all Term Lenders (indicating in such notice the amount of such
repayment to be applied to each such Term Lender's outstanding Term Loans).
Borrower's offer to permit the Term Lenders to waive any such Waivable Mandatory
Prepayment may apply to all or part of such repayment; provided, that any offer
to waive part of such repayment must be made ratably to the Term Lenders on the
basis of their outstanding Term Loans. In the event any such Term Lender desires
to waive such Term Lender's right to receive any such Waivable Mandatory
Prepayment in whole or in part, such Term Lender shall so advise the
Administrative Agent no later than the close of business two (2) Business Days
after the date of such notice from the Administrative Agent, which notice shall
also include the amount such Term Lender desires to receive in respect of such
prepayment. If any Term Lender does not reply to the Administrative Agent within
the two (2) Business Days after the date of such notice from the Administrative
Agent, it will be deemed not to have waived any part of such prepayment. If any
Term Lender does not specify an amount it wishes to receive, it will be deemed
to have accepted 100% of the total payment. The aggregate amount waived by the
Term Lenders pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall be applied to the Term A
Loans on a pro rata basis to those Term A Lenders that have not elected to waive
such prepayments.

          (j)     MANDATORY PREPAYMENT ON JUNE 30, 2006. If, as of the close of
business on June 30, 2006, the outstanding principal amount of Term B Loans
shall exceed $100 million, Borrower shall on the following Business Day prepay,
in full, the outstanding principal amount of any outstanding Loans, together
with all accrued interest, fees and other expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders as a result of such prepayment.

          4.3     APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS.

          (a)     PREPAYMENTS. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
all prepayments of principal of the Term Loans made by Borrower pursuant to
SECTION 4.2(b), (d), (e), (f) and (h) shall, for so long as any Term B Loans
shall be outstanding, first be applied to the payment of the unpaid principal
amount of the Term B Loans in proportional amounts equal to each Term B Lender's
Pro Rata Share of such prepayment and, after the Term B Loans have been repaid,
applied to the payment of the unpaid principal amount of the Term A Loans in
proportional amounts equal to each Term A Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
prepayment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of prepayments made following
the payment in full of all Term B Loans, up to 50% of such prepayment shall be
applied pro rata to the Scheduled Term A Loans Principal Payments to be made
within the twelve-month period following the date of such prepayment and the
remaining portion of such prepayment shall be applied to Scheduled Term A Loans
Principal Payments in inverse order of maturity. If any prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans shall reduce the outstanding amount of any Tranche of Eurodollar Loans to
an amount less than $10,000,000, such Eurodollar Loans shall immediately be
converted into Base Rate Loans. All

                                       47
<Page>

prepayments shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount so
prepaid, shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to
principal and shall include amounts payable, if any, under SECTION 3.4.

          (b)     PAYMENTS. All payments of principal on the Term Loans shall be
applied within the applicable Facility (i) first to the payment of Base Rate
Loans and second to the payment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) with respect
to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in such order as Borrower shall request (and in the
absence of such request, as Administrative Agent shall determine). All payments
shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount so paid, shall
be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal and shall
include amounts payable, if any, under SECTION 3.4.

          4.4     METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT BY BORROWER.

          (a)     Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments
(including prepayments) to be made by Borrower on account of principal,
interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall be made without setoff
or counterclaim and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be
made to Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the applicable Lenders
in immediately available funds, no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on
the date specified herein. Any such payment shall be made to such account of
Administrative Agent as Administrative Agent shall specify by notice to Borrower
provided, that unless and until otherwise specified, all such payments shall be
made to Administrative Agent at its office at 31 West 52nd Street, New York, NY
10022. Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its
applicable Pro Rata Share of the Term A Loan or of the Term B Loan (or other
applicable share as expressly provided herein), as the case may be, of such
principal, interest, fees or other amounts, in like funds as received. Any
payment which is received by Administrative Agent later than 1:00 P.M. (local
time in the place of payment) shall be deemed to have been received on the
immediately succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall
continue to accrue until such payment is deemed to have been received.

          (b)     Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a
day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of interest or fees, as the case may be, subject to the provisions
set forth in the definition of "Interest Period" herein.

          (c)     Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder
that Borrower will not make such payment in full, Administrative Agent may
assume that Borrower has made such payment in full to Administrative Agent as
required hereunder on such date and Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
so required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If
and to the extent Borrower shall not have made such payment in full to
Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to Administrative Agent on demand
such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon for each
day from the date such amount was distributed to such Lender until the date such
Lender repays such amount to Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Rate as
in effect for each such day.

          4.5     NET PAYMENTS.

          (a)     All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under any Loan
Document will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as
provided in SECTION 4.5(d), all payments hereunder and under any of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, payments on account of principal and
interest and fees) shall be made by Borrower free and clear of and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, duty,
levy, impost, assessment or other charge of whatever nature now or hereafter
imposed by any Governmental Authority, but excluding therefrom:

                  (i)    a tax imposed on or measured by the overall net income
     (including a franchise tax based on net income) of the Lender or its
     lending offices by the USA or jurisdictions or political subdivision or
     taxing authority thereof in which such Lender's principal office or lending
     offices are located or are resident or in which such Lender is
     incorporated;

                  (ii)   in the case of any Lender organized under the laws of
     any jurisdiction other than the USA or any state thereof (including the
     District of Columbia), any taxes imposed by the USA by means of withholding
     at the source unless such withholding results from a change in applicable
     law, treaty or regulations or the interpretation or administration thereof
     (including, without limitation, any guideline or policy not having the
     force of law) by any authority charged with the administration thereof
     subsequent to the date such Lender becomes a Lender with respect to the
     Loan or portion thereof affected by such change;

                  (iii)  any taxes to which the Lender (to the extent of the tax
     rate then in effect) would be subject to (as of the Closing Date) if a
     payment hereunder had been received by the Lender and, with respect to any
     Lender that becomes a party hereto after the date hereof, any taxes to
     which such Lender (to the extent of the tax rate then in effect) would be
     subject as of the date it becomes a party hereto if a payment had been
     received by the Lender (other than taxes which each other Lender is
     entitled to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement);

                  (iv)   taxes to which the Lender becomes subject subsequent to
     the date referred to in clause (iii) above as a result of a change in the
     residence, place of incorporation, or principal place of business of the
     Lender, a change in the branch or lending office of the Lender
     participating in the transactions set forth herein or other similar
     circumstances unless such change or similar circumstance shall have been
     made at the request of the Borrower, and

                  (v)    taxes as a result of the recognition by the Lender of
     gain on the sale, assignment or participation by the Lender of the
     participating interests in its creditor positions hereunder (such tax or
     taxes, other than excluded tax or taxes, being herein referred to as "TAX"
     or "TAXES"). If Borrower is required by law to make any deduction or
     withholding of any Taxes from any payment due hereunder or under any of the
     Loan Documents, then the amount payable will be increased to such amount
     which, after deduction from such increased amount of all such Taxes
     required to be withheld or

                                       49
<Page>

     deducted therefrom, will not be less than the amount due and payable
     hereunder had no such deduction or withholding been required. A certificate
     as to any additional amounts payable to a Lender under this SECTION 4.5
     submitted to Borrower by such Lender shall show in reasonable detail the
     amount payable and the calculations used to determine in good faith such
     amount and shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding
     upon all parties hereto.

          (b)     If Borrower makes any payment hereunder or under any of the
Loan Documents in respect of which it is required by law to make any deduction
or withholding of any Taxes, it shall pay the full amount to be deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxation or other authority within the time allowed for
such payment under applicable law and shall deliver to the Lenders within 30
days after it has made such payment to the applicable authority a receipt issued
by such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts so
required to be deducted or withheld from such payment.

          (c)     Without prejudice to the other provisions of this SECTION 4.5,
if any Lender, or Administrative Agent on its behalf, is required by law to make
any payment on account of Taxes on or in relation to any amount received or
receivable hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents by such Lender, or
Administrative Agent on its behalf, or any liability for Tax in respect of any
such payment is imposed, levied or assessed against any Lender or Administrative
Agent on its behalf, Borrower will promptly, following receipt of the
certificate described in the immediately following sentence, indemnify such
person against such Tax payment or liability, together with any interest,
penalties and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) payable
or incurred in connection therewith, including any tax of any Lender arising by
virtue of payments under this SECTION 4.5(c), computed in a manner consistent
with this SECTION 4.5(c). A certificate prepared in good faith as to the amount
of such payment by such Lender, or Administrative Agent on its behalf, showing
calculations thereof in reasonable detail, absent manifest error, shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto for all purposes.

          (d)     Each Lender that is not a USA person (as such term is defined
in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to Borrower and
Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of a Lender
that is an Assignee of an interest under this Agreement (unless the respective
Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment), on
the date of such assignment to such Lender, (i) two accurate and complete
original signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (or successor or
other applicable forms prescribed by the IRS) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement to a complete exemption from or reduced rate of USA withholding tax
on interest payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii)
if the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code and cannot deliver the applicable form pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a
certificate substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 4.5(d) (any such certificate, a
"SECTION 4.5(d)(ii) CERTIFICATE") and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed copies of IRS Form W-8 BEN or W-8EC1 (or successor form) certifying to
such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption from USA withholding tax on
payments of interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Note;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be required to deliver a an IRS Form
W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8IMY, or Section 4.5(d)(ii) Certificate under this SECTION
4.5(d) to the extent that the delivery of such form is not authorized by law;
PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that

                                       50
<Page>

in the event that a Lender provides the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
with an IRS Form W-8IMY (or substitute form) indicating that it is a "flow
through" entity, as defined in Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
1441 of the Code, or otherwise, not a beneficial owner of interest payments
under this Agreement and under any Note, such Lender agrees, on or prior to the
Closing Date, or the date of assignment to such Lender, as applicable, to take
any actions necessary, and to deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent all
forms necessary, to establish such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption
from, or a reduction in, USA withholding tax on payments of interest to be made
under this Agreement and under any Note, including causing its partners,
members, beneficiaries, beneficial owners, and their beneficial owners, if any,
to take any actions and deliver any forms necessary to establish such exemption.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a fiscally transparent entity may provide an
IRS Form W-8BEN to claim a treaty exemption or rate reduction to the extent that
such entity is receiving interest and is not treated as fiscally transparent by
its own jurisdiction, provided the satisfaction of such conditions entitles the
Lender to an exemption or reduction from withholding at the time such Lender
becomes a party to this Agreement and (ii) a withholding foreign partnership,
withholding foreign trust, and qualified intermediary shall only provide such
information as is required by Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code
Section 1441. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Forms" shall include any
attachments for to IRS Forms W-8IMY required to be filed by the Lender. In
addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the Closing Date, when
a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification
obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender will deliver to
Borrower and Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete original signed
copies of an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, or W-8IMY and a Section 4.5(d)(ii)
Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in
order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender (or its partners,
members, beneficiaries, or beneficial owners) to a continued exemption from or
reduction in USA withholding Tax on interest payments under this Agreement and
any Note, or it shall immediately notify Borrower and Administrative Agent of
its inability to deliver any such form or certificate; provided, however, that
no Lender shall be required to deliver an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, or W-8IMY
under this SECTION 4.5(d) to the extent that the delivery of such form is not
authorized by law; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that any Lender which does not
deliver the applicable form pursuant to SECTION 4.5(d) shall be entitled to
additional payment pursuant to SECTION 4.5(a) or indemnification under SECTION
4.5(c) only if and to the extent (i) such failure results solely from a change
in law or (ii) the Tax to which such additional payment or indemnification
relates would have been imposed regardless of whether such Lender provided such
forms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in SECTION 4.5 any
Lender that has not provided to Borrower the IRS Forms required to be provided
to Borrower pursuant to this SECTION 4.5(d) shall not be entitled to any payment
of additional amounts pursuant to SECTION 4.5(a) or indemnification under
SECTION 4.5(c) with respect to any deduction or withholding which would not have
been required if such Lender had provided such forms.

          (e)     Each Lender that is incorporated or organized under the laws
of the USA or a state thereof shall provide two properly completed and duly
executed copies of IRS Form W-9, or any successor or other applicable form. Each
Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (provided that such
Lender remains lawfully able to do so), two further duly executed forms and
statements, properly completed in all material respects, at or before the time
any such form or statement expires or becomes obsolete, or otherwise as
reasonably requested by Borrower. Each Lender shall promptly notify Borrower at
any time it determines

                                       51
<Page>

that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered
certificate to Borrower (or any other form or certification adopted by U.S.
taxing authorities for such purpose).

          (f)     Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after it
becomes aware of the occurrence of any event or the existence of any condition
that would cause Borrower to make a payment in respect of any Taxes to such
Lender pursuant to SECTION 4.5(a) or a payment in indemnification for any Taxes
pursuant to SECTION 4.5(c), it will use reasonable efforts to make, fund or
maintain the Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender with respect to which the
aforementioned payment is or would be made through another lending office of
such Lender or take any other action reasonably requested by Borrower if as a
result thereof the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be
paid by such Borrower in respect of such Loans (or portions thereof) pursuant to
SECTION 4.5(a) or SECTION 4.5(c) would be materially reduced, and if, as
determined by such Lender, in its reasonable discretion, the making, funding or
maintaining of such Loans (or portions thereof) through such other lending
office or taking of such other action would not otherwise materially adversely
affect such Loans or such Lender. Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable expenses
incurred by any Lender in utilizing another lending office of such Lender or
taking of such other action pursuant to this SECTION 4.5(f).

          4.6     SHARING OF PAYMENTS; ETC.

          (a)     If, other than as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, any
Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or
otherwise) in excess of its applicable Pro Rata Share (or other pro rata share
as expressly provided herein) of payments on account of Loans made or
participated in by all the Lenders under any Facility, such Lender shall
forthwith (x) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and (y) purchase from
the other Lenders in such Facility, such participations in the Term Loans made
by them and then due, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender, such purchase shall to that
extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender
the purchase price paid therefor together with an amount equal to such paying
Lender's applicable Pro Rata Share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Lender), of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.
Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in
the absence of manifest error), of participations purchased pursuant to this
SECTION 4.6(a) and will in each case promptly notify the Lenders and Borrower
following any such purchases. Any payments received after the Lenders have taken
action pursuant to this SECTION 4.6(a) shall be allocated ratably among the
Loans.

          (b)     Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation
from another Lender pursuant to this SECTION 4.6 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
setoff, but subject to SECTION 12.6) with respect to such participation as fully
as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

                                       52
<Page>

          (c)     Nothing herein shall require any Lender to exercise any right
of setoff or similar rights or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise,
and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other
indebtedness or obligation of Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to
make the Loans, Borrower makes the following representations and warranties
(both before and after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions):

          6.1     CORPORATE STATUS.

          Each of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized
and validly existing corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust
or other entity in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization (or the equivalent thereof in the case of Foreign Subsidiaries)
except where the failure to be in such good standing would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, (ii) has the corporate or partnership or other requisite power
and authority to own its property and assets and to transact the business in
which it is engaged and presently proposed to engage in and (iii) is duly
qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing in each other
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for such failure to
be so qualified which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          6.2     CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY.

          Each Credit Party has the corporate or other appropriate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each of
the Loan Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary corporate or
other appropriate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
it of each of such Loan Documents. Each Credit Party has duly executed and
delivered each of the Loan Documents to which it is party, and each of such Loan
Documents constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable
principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).

          6.3     NO VIOLATION.

          The execution, delivery or performance by any Credit Party of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the granting of
Liens pursuant to the Security Documents), nor compliance by it with the terms
and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
therein (i) will contravene any provision of any Requirement of Law applicable
to any Credit Party, (ii) will conflict with or result in any breach of or
constitute a tortious interference with any of the terms, covenants, conditions
or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or
imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien (except pursuant
to the Security Documents) upon any of the property or assets of any Credit
Party pursuant to the terms of, any Contractual Obligation to which any Credit
Party is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets is bound or to
which it may be subject, (iii) will violate any provision of any Organizational
Document of any Credit Party or

                                       61
<Page>

(iv) requires any approval of stockholders or any approval or consent of any
Person (other than a Governmental Authority) except as have been obtained or as
set forth on SCHEDULE 6.3.

          6.4     GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER APPROVALS.

          Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 6.4 hereto and except for the
recording of the Mortgage Supplements and the filing of UCC financing
statements, which shall be recorded and filed, respectively, on, or as soon as
practicable after, the date hereof, no order, consent, approval, license,
authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with or
exemption by, any Governmental Authority (except as have been obtained or made
on or prior to the Closing Date), is required to authorize, or is required in
connection with, the execution, delivery and performance of any Loan Document.

          6.5     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; FINANCIAL CONDITION; UNDISCLOSED
LIABILITIES; ETC.

          (a)     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Historical Financial Statements
copies of which have been furnished to Administrative Agent prior to the date
hereof, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) subject, in the case of interim
statements, to normal year end adjustments. Each Historical Financial Statement
presents fairly the financial condition of the applicable Credit Party as of the
date thereof. The Historical Financial Statements identified on SCHEDULE 6.5(a)
as audited financial statements have been examined by Deloitte & Touche,
independent certified public accountants, who delivered an opinion in respect
thereto, and present fairly the financial condition of the applicable Credit
Party at the date of each respective audited balance sheet. Since December 31,
2001, there has been no Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)     SOLVENCY. On and as of the Closing Date, after giving effect
to the Transactions and to all Indebtedness (including the Loans) being
incurred, and to be incurred (and the use of proceeds thereof), and Liens
created, and to be created, by Borrower in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of Borrower
and each other Material Subsidiary will exceed its debts; (ii) neither Borrower
nor any Material Subsidiary has incurred and does not intend to, nor believes
that it will, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts
mature; and (iii) Borrower and each other Material Subsidiary will have
sufficient capital with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this
SECTION 6.5(b) "debt" means any liability on a claim, and "claim" means (y) any
right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured (including all obligations,
if any, under any Plan or the equivalent for unfunded past service liability,
and any other unfunded medical and death benefits) or (z) any right to an
equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to
judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured
or unsecured. In computing the amount of contingent or unliquidated liabilities
at any time, such liabilities will be computed at the amount which, in light of
all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount
that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

                                       62
<Page>

          (c)     NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as fully reflected in the
financial statements and the notes related thereto delivered pursuant to SECTION
6.5(a) and on SCHEDULE 6.5(d) there were, to the best of Borrower's knowledge,
as of the Closing Date (and after giving effect to the Transactions occurring on
such date) no liabilities or obligations with respect to Borrower and its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in
aggregate, would be material to Borrower.

          (d)     INDEBTEDNESS. SCHEDULE 6.5(d) sets forth a true and complete
list of (i) all Indebtedness of Borrower, HSCHC and HSCC and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than Loans, Intercompany Indebtedness or Priority Loans)
that is outstanding as of the Closing Date and that remains outstanding after
giving effect to the Transactions, to the extent that, in each case, such
Indebtedness is in excess of $1,000,000 (the "EXISTING OBLIGATIONS"), in
aggregate principal amount thereof as of a date not more than three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (and the aggregate amount of any undrawn
commitments with respect thereto as of the date specified therein), and (ii)
Interest Rate Agreements, the notional amount thereof and the name of the
respective obligor and any other entity which directly or indirectly guaranteed
such debt. No Existing Obligation has been incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Borrower has delivered or caused to be delivered to Administrative Agent
a true and complete copy of the form of each instrument evidencing Indebtedness
for money borrowed listed on SCHEDULE 6.5(d) and of each instrument pursuant to
which such Indebtedness for money borrowed was issued.

          (e)     PRO FORMA. The PRO FORMA balance sheet of Borrower attached
hereto as SCHEDULE 6.5(e) (the "PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET") presents fairly the
financial condition of Borrower at the date of such balance sheet and presents a
good faith estimate of the PRO FORMA financial condition of Borrower (after
giving effect to the Transactions, and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby) at the date thereof). The Pro Forma Balance Sheet has been
prepared using financial statements of Borrower and its Subsidiaries which were
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) subject to normal year-end adjustments.

          (f)     PROJECTIONS. On and as of the Closing Date, the financial
projections, attached hereto as SCHEDULE 6.5(f) and previously delivered to
Administrative Agent and the Lenders (the "PROJECTIONS") and each of the
Projections delivered after the Closing Date pursuant to SECTION 7.2(f) are, at
the time made, based on good faith estimates and assumptions made by the
management of Borrower, and there are no statements or conclusions in any of the
Projections which, at the time made, are based upon or include information known
to Borrower to be misleading or which fail to take into account material
information regarding the matters reported therein. On the Closing Date,
Borrower believes that the Projections are reasonable and attainable, it being
understood that uncertainty is inherent in any forecasts or projections and that
no assurance can be given that the results set forth in the Projections will
actually be obtained.

          6.6     LITIGATION.

          There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best
knowledge of Borrower, threatened (except for litigation that would be rendered
moot by, or would not

                                       63
<Page>

survive, the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization) against Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries (i) with respect to any Loan Document seeking to enjoin
Borrower's or any Subsidiary's performance thereof or (ii) which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.7     TRUE AND COMPLETE DISCLOSURE.

          All factual information (taken as a whole) heretofore or
contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in writing (including electronically) to any Lender (other than the
Projections as to which SECTION 6.5(f) applies) for purposes of or in connection
with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein is, and all other
such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf
of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in writing to any Lender for purposes of
or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein will
be, true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such
information is dated or certified and not incomplete by omitting to state any
fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole) not misleading in any
material respect at such time in light of the circumstances under which such
information was provided. The Lenders acknowledge that they have not relied on
Borrower's company brochures.

          6.8     MARGIN REGULATIONS.

          No part of the proceeds of any Loan has been or will be used to
purchase or carry any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the Board),
directly or indirectly, or to extend credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any such margin stock for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin
security or for any other purpose which might cause any of the loans or
extensions of credit under this Agreement to be considered a "purpose credit"
within the meaning of Regulation T, U or X of the Board.

          6.9     TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS.

          Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed or caused to be filed
all tax returns which are required to be filed, except where failure to file any
such returns would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said
returns or on any assessments made against them or any of their respective
material properties and all other material taxes, fees or other charges imposed
on them or any of their respective properties by any Governmental Authority
(other than those the amount or validity of which is contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with
GAAP have been provided on the books of Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be) except where failure to take any such action would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and no tax liens have been filed
and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes, fees or other
charges (other than such liens or claims, the amount or validity of which is
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided) which
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.10    COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

          Each Plan has been operated and administered in a manner so as not to
result in any material liability of Borrower for failure to comply with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code; no Reportable Event which could
reasonably be expected to result in the termination of any Plan has occurred
with respect to a Plan; to the best knowledge of Borrower, no Multiemployer Plan
is insolvent or in reorganization; as of the Closing Date, the aggregate present
value of the accrued benefits as of the Closing Date under each Plan does not
exceed the aggregate fair market value of the assets of such Plan, in each case,
by more than $3,000,000 using the actuarial funding assumptions in effect for
such Plan as of the most recent valuation date; no Plan has an accumulated or
waived funding deficiency or has applied for an extension of any amortization
period within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code; neither Borrower nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability
to or on account of a Plan pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4062,
4063, 4064, 4069, 4201 or 4204 of ERISA or Section 4971 or 4975 of the Code; no
proceedings have been instituted to terminate any Plan within the last fiscal
year; using actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with
subpart 1 of subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, to the best knowledge of Borrower,
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates would not have any
material liability to any Plans which are Multiemployer Plans in the event of a
complete withdrawal therefrom, as of the close of the most recent fiscal year of
each such Multiemployer Plan ending prior to the Closing Date; no Lien imposed
under the Code or ERISA on the assets of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate exists or is likely to arise on account of any Plan; and
Borrower and its Subsidiaries do not maintain or contribute to any employee
welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which provides
benefits to retired employees (other than as required by Section 601 of ERISA)
or any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) the
obligations with respect to either of which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.11    OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY.

          Each of Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries has good and
marketable title in fee simple to, a valid leasehold interest in, or a valid
contractual agreement to use, all its material real property, and good title to,
a valid leasehold interest in, or valid contractual rights to use all its other
material property, and none of such property is subject to any Lien except for
Permitted Liens. As of the Closing Date, Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries have granted mortgages to secure the Obligations on all parcels of
real estate which have an estimated fair market value in excess of $1,000,000.

          6.12    CAPITALIZATION OF BORROWER.

          On the Closing Date, the capitalization of Borrower is as set forth on
SCHEDULE 6.12 hereto. All shares of Capital Stock of Borrower have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. Except as
set forth on SCHEDULE 6.12, no authorized but unissued or treasury shares of
Capital Stock of Borrower are subject to any option, warrant, right to call or
commitment of any kind or character. A complete and correct copy of each of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Borrower in effect on the date of
this Agreement has been delivered to Administrative Agent. Except as set forth
on SCHEDULE 6.12, Borrower does

                                       65
<Page>

not have any outstanding stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for any shares of its Capital Stock, or any rights issued to any Person (either
preemptive or other) to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the
purchase of, or any agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or
otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to
any of its Capital Stock or any stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any of its Capital Stock (other than as set forth in the
certificate of incorporation of Borrower). Neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to
repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire any shares of its Capital Stock or any
convertible securities, rights or options of the type described in the preceding
sentence except for agreements the performance of which would not violate this
Agreement. As of the Closing Date, all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Capital Stock of Borrower are owned of record by the stockholders as set forth
on SCHEDULE 6.12 hereto.

          6.13    SUBSIDIARIES.

          (a)     ORGANIZATION. SCHEDULE 6.13 hereto sets forth, as of the date
hereof, a true, complete and correct list of each Restricted Subsidiary of
Borrower and indicates for each such Subsidiary (i) its jurisdiction of
incorporation and (ii) its ownership (by holder and percentage interest). As of
the date hereof, Borrower has no Restricted Subsidiaries except for those
Restricted Subsidiaries listed as such on SCHEDULE 6.13 hereto.

          (b)     CAPITALIZATION. All shares of Capital Stock of each Restricted
Subsidiary of Borrower have been duly authorized and validly issued and, to the
extent applicable in the case of Foreign Subsidiaries, are fully paid and
non-assessable and, to the extent owned by Borrower, are owned by Borrower free
and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. No authorized but unissued or
treasury shares of Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of Borrower are
subject to any option, warrant, right to call or commitment of any kind or
character.

          (c)     RESTRICTIONS ON OR RELATING TO SUBSIDIARIES. There does not
exist any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of (i) any
Restricted Subsidiary of Borrower to pay dividends or make any other
distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in its
profits owned by Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of Borrower, or to pay
any Indebtedness owed to Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary of Borrower, (ii)
any Restricted Subsidiary of Borrower to make loans or advances to Borrower or
any of Borrower's Subsidiaries or (iii) Borrower or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to transfer any of its properties or assets to Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, except for such encumbrances or restrictions permitted to
exist under SECTION 8.13.

          6.14    COMPLIANCE WITH LAW, ETC.

          Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or in
violation of any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation or under its
Organizational Documents, as the case may be, in each case the consequences of
which default or violation, either in any one case or in the aggregate, would
have a Material Adverse Effect.

case where such Release or substantial threat of a Material Release could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (iv) there is not now,
nor to the knowledge of Borrower has there ever been, on or from any current or

          6.18    LABOR RELATIONS.

          Neither Borrower nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is engaged in
any unfair labor practice that could reasonably be expected to have a Material

for titled vehicles, vessels and other collateral which may not be perfected
through the filing of financing statements under the Uniform Commercial Code of
the appropriate jurisdiction and which have an aggregate fair market value of
less than $5,000,000, all such liens have been or, upon the filing of the

liens except for Permitted Liens. The recordation in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office and in the United States Copyright Office of assignments
for security made pursuant to the Security Agreement will be effective, under
Federal law, to perfect the security interest granted to the Collateral Agent in
the trademarks, patents and copyrights covered by the Security Agreement. The
recordation with the United States Surface Transportation Board of assignments
for security made pursuant to the Security Agreement will be effective under
Federal law, to create a valid first lien in favor of the Collateral Agent the
in the railcars covered by the Security Agreement. Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all Collateral, free and clear of
all Liens except Permitted Liens.

          (b)     PLEDGED SECURITIES. The security interests created in favor of
the Collateral Agent, as pledgee for the benefit of the Lenders under the
Security Agreement, constitute perfected security interests in the Pledged
Securities and Pledged Intercompany Notes, subject to no security interests of
any other Person other than Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in the Security
Agreement, no filings, registrations or recordings which have not been made or
will not have been made (or submitted for recordation) within 10 Business Days
after the Closing Date are required in order to perfect the security interests
created in the Pledged Securities or Pledged Intercompany Notes under the
Security Agreement. Sixty-five percent (65%) of the Capital Stock of all direct
Foreign Subsidiaries with a net book value and a fair market value in excess of
$250,000 are pledged to the Collateral Agent.

          (c)     REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL. The Mortgages create, as security
for the obligations purported to be secured thereby, a valid and enforceable
perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Mortgaged Property
(including, without limitation, all fixtures and improvements relating to such
Mortgaged Property and affixed or added thereto on or after the Closing Date) in
favor of the Collateral Agent (or such other trustee as may be named therein)

                                       69

for the benefit of the secured parties under the Security Agreement, superior to
and prior to the rights of all third Persons (except that the security interest
created in the Mortgaged Property may be subject to the Permitted Liens related
thereto) and subject to no other Liens (other than Liens permitted under
SECTION 8.1). SCHEDULE 6.21(c) contains a true and complete list as of the
Closing Date of (x) each parcel of real property of Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries with an estimated fair market value in excess of $1,000,000, (y)
the type of interest in such parcel of real property held by Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiaries and (z) whether or not such parcel of real property is
Mortgaged Property. Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to all Mortgaged Property free and clear of all Liens except
those described in the first sentence of this SECTION 6.21(c).

          (d)     DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. All domestic Deposit Accounts and
disbursement accounts of Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries whose balances
exceed $100,000 as of the Closing Date are listed on SCHEDULE 6.21(d). Neither
the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has granted any interest in any such Deposit
Account or disbursement account to any Person other than pursuant to the
Security Documents or the "Security Documents" as such term is defined in the
Priority Credit Agreement.

          6.22    CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. Since October 31, 2001, neither
Borrower nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has made any charitable
contributions except as would have been permitted pursuant to SECTION 8.17 if it
had been in effect at such time.

          6.23    ASBESTOS MATTERS. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary of
the Borrower (a) manufactures, produces or sells any product containing
asbestos; or (b) has manufactured, produced or sold any product containing
asbestos prior to the Effective Date which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

          7.9     ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

          (a)     ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Borrower shall, and shall cause each
of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the exercise of its reasonable business
judgment, to take prompt and appropriate action to respond to any material
non-compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or to
any material Release or a substantial threat of a material Release of a
Contaminant, and upon request from Administrative Agent, shall regularly report
to Administrative Agent on such response. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, whenever Administrative Agent or any Lender has a reasonable basis to
believe that Borrower is not in material compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or that any property of Borrower or
its Subsidiaries, or any property to which Contaminants generated by Borrower or
its Subsidiaries have come to be located ("OFFSITE PROPERTY") has or may become
contaminated or subject to an order or decree such that any non-compliance,
contamination or order or decree could reasonably be anticipated to have a
Material Adverse Effect, then, to the extent Borrower has the legal right to do
so, Borrower agrees to, at Administrative Agent's request and Borrower's
expense: (i) cause an independent environmental engineer reasonably acceptable
to Administrative Agent to conduct such tests of the site where the alleged or
actual non-compliance or contamination has occurred and prepare and deliver to
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Borrower a report(s) reasonably acceptable
to Administrative Agent setting forth the results of such tests, Borrower's
proposed plan and schedule for responding to any environmental problems
described therein, and Borrower's estimate of the costs thereof; and (ii)
provide Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Borrower a supplemental report(s)
of such engineer whenever the scope of the environmental problems or Borrower's
response thereto or the estimated costs thereof, shall materially change.
Notwithstanding the above, Borrower shall not be obligated (other than as
required by applicable law) to undertake any tests or remediation at any Offsite
Property that (a) is not owned or operated by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and (b) where Contaminants generated by persons other than Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries have also come to be located.

          (b)     ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY. Borrower shall, and shall cause each
of its Restricted Subsidiaries, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and their respective employees, agents,
officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties,
fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or
nature known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, arising out of, or in any way
relating to the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any
Environmental Law applicable to the operations of Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties, or any orders, requirements or
demands of Governmental Authorities related thereto, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney's and consultant's fees, investigation and
laboratory fees, response costs, court costs and litigation expenses, except to
the extent that any of the foregoing arise out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification therefor. The agreements
in this SECTION 7.9(b) shall survive repayment of the Notes and all other
Obligations.

          7.10    ADDITIONAL SECURITY; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

          (a)     AGREEMENT TO GRANT ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Promptly, and in any
event within thirty (30) days after the acquisition by Borrower or any
Restricted Domestic Subsidiary

                                       77
<Page>

of assets or real or personal property of the type that would have constituted
Collateral on the date hereof, in each case in which the Collateral Agent does
not have a perfected security interest under the Security Documents (other than
(t) equipment subject to Liens permitted under SECTION 8.1(b) under agreements
which prohibit the creation of additional Liens on such assets, (u) the property
subject to the Headquarters Mortgage Loan Documents, (v) Capital Stock of a

to be prepaid other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment (other
than with proceeds of the event giving rise to such prepayment), prior to the
stated maturity thereof; or

          (h)     JUDGMENTS. One or more judgments or decrees shall be entered

seq. of ERISA) as a result of such events listed in subclauses (i) through (v)
above exceeds $7,500,000; or

          (j)     CHANGE IN CONTROL. A Change of Control shall occur; or

          (k)     SECURITY DOCUMENTS. At any time after the execution and

and effect or shall cease to give the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders the Liens, rights, powers and privileges purported to be created thereby
(including, without limitation, a first priority perfected security interest in,

no other Liens (except to the extent expressly permitted herein or therein); or

          (l)     HOLDCO AGREEMENT BREACH. A "Default" (as defined in the Holdco
Agreement) shall occur under the Holdco Agreement.

          If any of the foregoing Events of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Administrative Agent, at the written direction of the Required
Lenders, shall take one or more of the following actions: (i) by written or oral
or telephonic notice (in the case of oral or telephonic notice confirmed in
writing immediately thereafter) to Borrower declare all sums then owing by
Borrower hereunder and under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable,
whereupon all such sums shall become and be immediately due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by Borrower, (ii) enforce, as Administrative Agent (to the
extent permitted under the applicable Loan Documents) or direct the Collateral
Agent to enforce, pursuant to the terms of the applicable Security Document, all
of the Liens and security interests created pursuant to the Security Documents.
In cases of any occurrence of any Event of Default described in clause (e) or
(f) of this SECTION 10.1, the Loans, together with accrued interest thereon,
shall become due and payable forthwith without the requirement of any such
acceleration or request, and without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower, any provision
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding,
and other amounts payable by Borrower hereunder shall also become immediately
due and payable all without notice of any kind.

          Anything in this SECTION 10.1 to the contrary notwithstanding,
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Required Lenders, rescind and
annul any acceleration of the Loans by written instrument filed with Borrower;
provided that at the time such acceleration is so rescinded and annulled: (A)
all past due interest and principal (other than principal due solely as a result
of such acceleration), if any, on the Loans and all other sums payable under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall have been duly paid, and (B)
no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing which shall not
have been waived in accordance with the provisions of SECTION 12.1 hereof.

          10.2    RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE.

          The rights provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights, powers, privileges or
remedies provided by

                                       95

law or in equity, or under any other instrument, document or agreement now
existing or hereafter arising.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

          In this ARTICLE XI, the Lenders agree among themselves as follows:

          11.1    APPOINTMENT.

          Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes
Administrative Agent (for purposes of this Agreement, the term Administrative
Agent shall include Administrative Agent in its capacity as Collateral Agent
pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as herein specified. Each Lender
hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance of
such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, Administrative Agent to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, to give notices and take such actions on behalf of the
Required Lenders as are consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all
Lenders, as the case may be) and any other instruments, documents and agreements
referred to therein and to exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof
and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent
may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Loan Documents, by or
through its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates.

          11.2    NATURE OF DUTIES.

          Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement. The duties of Administrative
Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. EACH LENDER HEREBY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT AGENT SHALL NOT HAVE, BY REASON OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP TO OR IN RESPECT OF ANY
LENDER. Nothing in any of the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended
to or shall be so construed as to impose upon Administrative Agent any
obligations in respect of any of the Loan Documents except as expressly set
forth herein or therein. Each Lender shall make its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower in connection
with the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and shall make its
own appraisal of the credit worthiness of Borrower, and Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing
basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before making of the Loans or at any
time or times thereafter. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender
at any time that the Required Lenders have instructed it to act or refrain from
acting pursuant to ARTICLE X.

          11.3    RIGHTS, EXCULPATION, ETC.

          Neither Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
agents, employees or affiliates shall be liable to any Lender for any action
taken or omitted by it hereunder or under

                                       96
<Page>

any of the Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused
by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct. Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility, or sufficiency of any of
the Loan Documents or any other document or the financial condition of Borrower.
Administrative Agent shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either
the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or any other document or the
financial condition of Borrower, or the existence or possible existence of any
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default unless requested to do so by the
Required Lenders. Administrative Agent may at any time request instructions from
the Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals (including the failure to
act or approve) which by the terms of any of the Loan Documents Administrative
Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are
requested, Administrative Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any
liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding
any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such
instructions from the Required Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders, as
applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of
action whatsoever against Administrative Agent as a result of either
Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting or approving under any of
the Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders
or, to the extent required by SECTION 12.1, all of the Lenders.

          11.4    RELIANCE.

          Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any written notice, statement, certificate, order or
other document or any telephone, telex, teletype, telecopier or electronic
message reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and, with respect to all matters
pertaining herein or to any of the other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder
or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.

          11.5    INDEMNIFICATION.

          To the extent that Administrative Agent is not reimbursed and
indemnified by Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify Administrative
Agent for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against Administrative Agent, acting pursuant hereto in such capacity, in any
way relating to or arising out of any of the Loan Documents or any action taken
or omitted by Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents, in
proportion to each Lender's Aggregate Pro Rata Share; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, claims, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The obligations of the Lenders under this SECTION 11.5 shall survive
the payment in full of the Notes and the termination of this Agreement. For
purposes hereof, "Aggregate Pro Rata Share" means, when used with reference to
any Lender and any described aggregate or total amount, an amount equal to the
result obtained by multiplying such desired aggregate or total

                                       97
<Page>

amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the aggregate principal
amount of such Lender's Term Loans and the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate of all of the Loans outstanding hereunder.

          11.6    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

          With respect to its Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall
have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the
same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any
other Lender or holder of Obligations. The terms "Lenders", "holder of
Obligations" or "Required Lenders" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity as a Lender, one of the Required Lenders or a holder of
Obligations. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with
Borrower or any Subsidiary of Borrower as if it were not acting as the
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document, including the
acceptance of fees or other consideration for services without having to account
for the same to any of the Lenders.

          11.7    NOTICE OF DEFAULTS. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default hereunder unless Administrative Agent has received
written notice from a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement describing
such Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default and stating that such notice
is a "notice of default". In the event Administrative Agent receives such a
notice, Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

          11.8    HOLDERS OF OBLIGATIONS. Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Obligation as reflected on the books and records of
Administrative Agent as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with Administrative Agent pursuant to SECTION 12.8(c). Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Obligation shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such
Obligation or of any Obligation or Obligations granted in exchange therefor.

          11.9    RESIGNATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

          (a)     Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all
its functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving fifteen (15) Business
Days' prior written notice to Borrower and the Lenders. Such resignation shall
take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Administrative Agent of
appointment pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) below.

          (b)     Upon any such notice of resignation by Administrative Agent,
Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall be
satisfactory to Borrower and shall be an incorporated bank or trust company.

          (c)     If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so
appointed within said 15 Business Day period, Administrative Agent, with the
consent of Borrower, shall then appoint its successor who shall serve as
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, until

                                       98
<Page>

such time, if any, as the Required Lenders, with the consent of Borrower,
appoint a successor as provided above.

          (d)     If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed
pursuant to clause (b) or (c), by the 20th Business Day after the date such
notice of resignation was given by Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
such resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall
thereafter perform all the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Required Lenders, with the consent of Borrower, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          12.1    NO WAIVER; MODIFICATIONS IN WRITING.

          (a)     No failure or delay on the part of Administrative Agent or any
Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to
Administrative Agent or any Lender at law or in equity or otherwise. Neither
this Agreement nor any terms hereof may be amended, modified, supplemented,
waived, discharged, terminated or otherwise changed unless such amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver, discharge, termination or other change is in
writing signed by the respective Credit Parties party thereto and the Required
Lenders, PROVIDED, that no such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver,

     second sentence of SECTION 4.5(a) (although the Required Lenders may waive
     in whole or in part, any such prepayment, repayment or commitment reduction
     so long as the application, as amongst the various Facilities, of any such
     prepayment, repayment or commitment reduction which is still required to be
     made is not altered);

                  (vii)  without the consent of the Majority Lenders of each
     Facility amend the definition of Majority Lenders;

                  (viii) without the consent of Supermajority Lenders:

                         (A)  amend, modify or waive SECTION 8.3 so as to permit

          (b)     If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge
or termination of any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by
clauses (a)(i) through (ix), inclusive, of the proviso to the third sentence of

at the option of Borrower if the respective Lender's consent is required with
respect to less than all Loans, to replace only the respective Loans of the
respective non-consenting Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such
Lender's individual consent) with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to
SECTION 3.6 so long as at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement
Lender consents to the proposed amendment, modification, supplement, waiver,
discharge, termination or other change or (B) repay outstanding Loans of such
Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such Lender's consent, in
accordance with SECTION 12.1(a); PROVIDED that, unless Loans repaid pursuant to
the preceding clause (B) are immediately replaced in full at such time through
the addition of new Lenders or the increase of outstanding Loans of existing
Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto), then in the case
of any action pursuant to preceding clause (B) the Required Lenders (determined
before giving effect to the proposed action) shall specifically consent thereto;
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that in any event the Borrower shall not have the right to
replace a Lender or repay its Loans solely as a result of the exercise of such
Lender's rights (and the withholding of any required consent by such Lender)
contemplated by the proviso to this SECTION 12.1(b).

          12.2    FURTHER ASSURANCES.

          Borrower agrees to do such further acts and things and to execute and
deliver to Administrative Agent such additional assignments, agreements, powers
and instruments, as Administrative Agent may reasonably require or deem
advisable to carry into effect the purposes of this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents or to better assure and confirm unto Administrative Agent its rights,
powers and remedies hereunder.

          (a)     GENERALLY. Borrower agrees without duplication to pay promptly

such taxes. Any portion of the foregoing fees, costs and expenses which remains
unpaid more than thirty (30) days following Administrative Agent's or any
Lender's statement and request for

                                       102
<Page>

payment thereof shall bear interest from the date of such statement and request
to the date of payment at the Default Rate.

          (b)     INDEMNIFICATION. Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless
Administrative Agent and each Lender and each director, officer, employee,
agent, attorney, trustee, advisor and Affiliate of Administrative Agent and each
Lender (each such Person an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON" and collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") from and against all losses, claims, damages, obligations
(including removal or remedial actions), expenses or liabilities (not including
Taxes as to which Borrower is not required to make any payment of additional
amounts pursuant to SECTION 4.7(c) hereof) to which such Indemnified Person may
become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, penalties, obligations
(including removal or remedial actions), expenses or liabilities (or actions,
suits or proceedings including any inquiry or investigation or claims in respect
thereof (whether or not Administrative Agent or any Lender is a party thereto))
arise out of, in any way relate to, or result from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and to reimburse each
Indemnified Person upon their demand, for any Attorney Costs or other expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,

                  (i)    that no Indemnified Person shall have the right to be
     so indemnified hereunder for any loss, claim, damage, penalties,
     obligations, expense or liability to the extent it arises or results from
     the gross negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnified
     Person as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and

                  (ii)   that nothing contained herein shall affect the
     obligations and liabilities of the Lenders to Borrower contained herein.

                  (iii)  If any action, suit or proceeding arising from any of
     the foregoing is brought against Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
     other Person indemnified or intended to be indemnified pursuant to this
     SECTION 12.4, Borrower will, if requested by Administrative Agent, any
     Lender or any such Indemnified Person, resist and defend such action, suit
     or proceeding or cause the same to be resisted and defended by counsel
     reasonably satisfactory to the Person or Persons indemnified or intended to
     be indemnified. Each Indemnified Person shall, unless Administrative Agent,
     a Lender or other Indemnified Person has made the request described in the
     preceding sentence and such request has been complied with, have the right
     to employ its own counsel (or (but not as well as) staff counsel) to
     investigate and control the defense of any matter covered by such indemnity
     and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
     expense of the indemnifying party. Excluding any liability to the extent
     arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
     Indemnified Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
     final non-appealable judgment, Borrower further agrees to indemnify and
     hold each Indemnified Person harmless from all loss, cost (including
     Attorney Costs), liability and damage whatsoever incurred by any
     Indemnified Person by reason of any violation of any Environmental Laws or
     Environmental Permits or for the Release or Threatened Release of any
     Contaminants into the environment for which Borrower or any of its
     Subsidiaries has any liability or which occurs upon the

                                       103
<Page>

     Mortgaged Property or which is related to any property currently or
     formerly owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of Borrower or any of
     its Subsidiaries, or by reason of the imposition of any Environmental Lien
     or which occurs by a breach of any of the representations, warranties or
     covenants relating to environmental matters contained herein, including,
     without limitation, by reason of any matters disclosed in SCHEDULE 6.17,
     provided that, with respect to any liabilities arising from acts or failure
     to act for which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is strictly liable
     under any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit, Borrower's obligation
     to each Indemnified Person under this indemnity shall likewise be without
     regard to fault on the part of Borrower or any such Subsidiary. If Borrower
     shall fail to do any act or thing which it has covenanted to do hereunder
     or any representation or warranty on the part of Borrower or any Subsidiary
     contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be breached,
     Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) do the same or
     cause it to be done or remedy any such breach, and may expend its funds for
     such purpose, and will use its best efforts to give prompt written notice
     to Borrower that it proposes to take such action. Any and all amounts so
     expended by Administrative Agent shall be repaid to it by Borrower promptly
     upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor, with interest at the Default
     Rate in effect from time to time during the period including the date so
     expended by Administrative Agent to the date of repayment. To the extent
     that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless Administrative
     Agent or any Lender as set forth in this SECTION 12.4 may be unenforceable
     because it is violative of any law or public policy, Borrower shall make
     the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the
     indemnified liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. The
     obligations of Borrower under this SECTION 12.4 shall survive the
     termination of this Agreement and the discharge of Borrower's other
     Obligations hereunder.

          12.5    CONFIRMATIONS.

          Each of Borrower and each holder of any portion of the Obligations
agrees from time to time, upon written request received by it from the other, to
confirm to the other in writing (with a copy of each such confirmation to
Administrative Agent) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loan or Loans
and other Obligations then outstanding.

          12.6    ADJUSTMENT.

          (a)     In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to Borrower, any
such notice being expressly waived by Borrower, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, to setoff and apply against any
Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, of Borrower to such Lender, any
amount owing from such Lender to Borrower, at or at any time after, the
happening of any of the above-mentioned events, and the aforesaid right of
setoff may be exercised by such Lender against Borrower or against any trustee
in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of Borrower, or against
anyone else claiming through or against, Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy,
debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or
execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such
right of setoff shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the
making, filing or issuance, or service

                                       104
<Page>

upon such Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a
receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify Borrower, Administrative Agent after any such setoff
and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

          (b)     Borrower expressly agrees that to the extent Borrower makes a
payment or payments and such payment or payments, or any part thereof, are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or are required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party under
any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to
the extent of such payment or repayment, the Indebtedness to the Lenders or part
thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force
and effect as if said payment or payments had not been made.

          12.7    EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.

          This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts,
when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
Agreement.

          12.8    BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; ADDITION AND SUBSTITUTION OF
LENDERS.

          (a)     This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Lenders, all future holders of the Notes
and their respective successors and assigns; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Borrower
may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder or in connection herewith or
any interest herein (voluntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of Administrative Agent and all of the Lenders.

          (b)     Each Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other
entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in all or any portion of its
Loans or any other interest of such Lender hereunder (in respect of any Lender,
its "CREDIT EXPOSURE"). In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance thereof, and Borrower and Administrative Agent shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each Lender shall from
time to time upon request of Borrower notify Borrower of the identity of any
Participants with respect to its Credit Exposure hereunder, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that failure to provide such notice will not affect the validity of such
participation. Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement
or any of the Loan Documents are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or
shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, provided that such right of setoff shall be subject to the obligation
of such Participant to share with the Lenders, and the Lenders agree to share
with such Participant, as provided in SECTION 4.6. Borrower also agrees

                                      105
<Page>

that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of SECTIONS 3.4, 3.5 and
4.5 with respect to its participation in the Loans outstanding from time to time
as if it were a Lender, PROVIDED that such Participant's benefits under SECTIONS
3.4, 3.5 and 4.5 shall be limited to the benefits that the primary Lender would
be entitled to thereunder. Each Lender agrees that any agreement between such
Lender and any such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall
not restrict such Lender's right to approve or agree to any amendment,
restatement, supplement or other modification to, waiver of, or consent under
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents except to the extent that any of the
foregoing would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in
which such Participant is participating (it being understood that amending the
definitions of Scheduled Term A Loans Principal Payments (other than the Term A
Loan Maturity Date) shall not constitute an extension of the final scheduled
maturity of any Loan or Note), or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment
of interest or fees on any such Loan or Note (except in connection with a waiver
of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates) or reduce the
principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the Participant's
participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that
waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Events of Default
or Unmatured Events of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of
such participation, and that an increase in any Loan shall be permitted without
the consent of any Participant if the Participant's participation is not
increased as a result thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by
Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security
Documents (except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents) supporting the
Loans hereunder in which such Participant is participating.

          (c)     Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees, including an Affiliate thereof (treating any fund that invests in
bank loans, any other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed by the same
investment advisor of such Lender or by an affiliate of such investment manager
as a single Eligible Assignee) (each an "ASSIGNEE"), all or any part of its
Loans pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached hereto as
EXHIBIT 12.8(c); PROVIDED that (i) it assigns its Credit Exposure in an amount
not less than $1,000,000 (except in the case of an assignment to another Lender)
and (ii) any assignment of all or any portion of any Lender's Loans to an
Assignee other than an Affiliate of such Lender or another Lender, or in the
case of a Lender that is a fund that invests in senior loans, any Related Fund
of any Lender, shall require the prior written consent of Administrative Agent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), PROVIDED FURTHER,
that notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, any Lender may at any time
assign all or any part of its Loans to any Affiliate of such Lender or to any
other Lender (or in the case of a Lender which is a Related Fund, to any Related
Fund of any Lender). Upon execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
and the payment of a nonrefundable assignment fee of $3,500 (provided that no
such fee shall be payable upon assignments by any Lender which is a fund to one
or more Related Fund) in immediately available funds to Administrative Agent at
its Payment Office in connection with each such assignment ($2,500 with respect
to assignments to any Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender), written notice
thereof by such transferor Lender to Administrative Agent and the recording by
Administrative Agent in the Register of such assignment and the resulting effect
upon the applicable Loans of the assigning Lender and the Assignee, the Assignee
shall have, to the extent of such assignment, the same rights and benefits as it
would have if it were a Lender hereunder and the holder of the Obligations
(provided that Borrower and

                                       106
<Page>

Administrative Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly
with the assignor Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to the
Assignee until written notice of such assignment, together with payment
instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the Assignee,
shall have been given to Borrower and Administrative Agent by the assignor
Lender and the Assignee) and, if the Assignee has expressly assumed, for the
benefit of Borrower, some or all of the transferor Lender's obligations
hereunder, such transferor Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder
to the extent of such assignment and assumption, and except as described above,
no further consent or action by Borrower, the Lenders or Administrative Agent
shall be required. At the time of each assignment pursuant to this SECTION
12.8(c) to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a
USA person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for
United States Federal income tax purposes, the respective Assignee shall provide
to Borrower and Administrative Agent the appropriate IRS Forms (and, if
applicable a Section 4.5(d)(ii) Certificate) described in SECTION 4.5(d). Each
Assignee shall take such Credit Exposure subject to the provisions of this
Agreement and to any request made, waiver or consent given or other action taken
hereunder, prior to the receipt by Administrative Agent and Borrower of written
notice of such transfer, by each previous holder of such Credit Exposure. Such
Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement, to
the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Assignee as a Lender and the resulting adjustment of all or a portion of the
rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement, the
determination of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Facility (in each case,
rounded to twelve decimal places), the Loans and any new Notes to be issued, at
Borrower's expense, to such Assignee, and no further consent or action by
Borrower or the Lenders shall be required to effect such amendments.

          (d)     Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant
or Assignee or its investment advisor (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession
concerning Borrower and any Subsidiary of Borrower which has been delivered to
such Lender by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered
to such Lender by Borrower in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of
Borrower prior to entering into this Agreement. Any Transferee or any
prospective Transferee to whom such financial information is disclosed shall be
required to maintain the confidentiality of such information pursuant to SECTION
12.17 as if they were parties to this Agreement

          (e)     Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, the Notes held by it) to secure
obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board without notice to, or the consent of,
Borrower; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest
under this SECTION 12.8(e) shall release a Lender from any obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
Any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans
to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee. No such pledge or
assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.

          12.9    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; MUTUAL WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

          (A)     ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND, BY EXECUTION
AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS FOR
ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE
JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH CREDIT PARTY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY
CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR
CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH CREDIT PARTY, AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH
OPPOSITE ITS SIGNATURE BELOW, SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE THIRTY (30) DAYS
AFTER SUCH MAILING. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF AGENT UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY LENDER OR THE HOLDER OF ANY NOTE TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER
MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED
AGAINST EACH CREDIT PARTY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

          (B)     EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION
WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY OF THE
AFORESAID ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE
(A) ABOVE AND HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM
IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

          (C)     EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY COURT OR JURISDICTION,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (A) ABOVE, IN RESPECT
TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

          12.10   GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH NOTE SHALL BE DEEMED TO
BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND FOR ALL PURPOSES
SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS AND DECISIONS OF SAID
STATE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

          12.11   SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          12.12   TRANSFERS OF NOTES. In the event that the holder of any Note
(including any Lender) shall transfer such Note, it shall immediately advise
Administrative Agent and Borrower of such transfer, and Administrative Agent and
Borrower shall be entitled conclusively to assume that no transfer of any Note
has been made by any holder (including any Lender) unless and until
Administrative Agent and Borrower shall have received written notice to the
contrary. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or as otherwise
expressly agreed in writing by all of the other parties hereto, no Lender shall,
by reason of the transfer of a Note or otherwise, be relieved of any of its
obligations hereunder. Each transferee of any Note shall take such Note subject
to the provisions of this Agreement and to any request made, waiver or consent
given or other action taken hereunder, prior to the receipt by Administrative
Agent and Borrower of written notice of such transfer, by each previous holder
of such Note, and, except as expressly otherwise provided in such transfer,
Administrative Agent and Borrower shall be entitled conclusively to assume that
the transferee named in such notice shall hereafter be vested with all rights
and powers under this Agreement with respect to the Pro Rata Share of Term A
Loans or Term B Loans, as the case may be, of the Loans of the Lender named as
the payee of the Note which is the subject of such transfer.

          12.13   REGISTRY. Borrower hereby designates Administrative Agent to
serve as Borrower's agent, solely for purposes of this SECTION 12.13 to maintain
a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Loans made by each of
the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans
of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such
recordation shall not affect Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans.
With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the rights to the principal of, and
interest on, any Loan shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on
the Register maintained by Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of
such Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor
with respect to such Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The
registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Loans shall be
recorded by Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by
Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and
Assumption Agreement pursuant to SECTION 12.8(c). Coincident with the delivery
of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to Administrative Agent for
acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan,
or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall
surrender the Note (if any) evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new
Notes in the same aggregate principal amount then owing to such assignor or
transferor Lender shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or
the new Lender. Borrower agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature
which

                                       109
<Page>

may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by Administrative Agent (other
than those arising from the gross negligence or willful negligence of the
Administrative Agent) in performing its duties under this SECTION 12.13.

          12.14   HEADINGS. The Table of Contents and Article and Section
headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall
not affect the construction of this Agreement.

          12.15   TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall terminate when
all outstanding Obligations and Loans have been paid in full; provided, however,
that the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and each Lender with
respect to any representation and warranty made by Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and the indemnification provisions
contained in this Agreement and any other Loan Document, shall be continuing and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

          12.16   CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Lenders severally agrees to keep
confidential all non-public information pertaining to Borrower and its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates which is provided to it by any such parties in
accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential
information of this nature and in a prudent fashion, and shall not disclose such
information to any Person except:

                  (i)    to the extent such information is public when received
     by such Lender or becomes public thereafter due to the act or omission of
     any party other than a Lender,

                  (ii)   to the extent such information is independently
     obtained from a source other than Borrower or its Subsidiaries and such
     information from such source is not, to such Lender's knowledge, subject to
     an obligation of confidentiality or, if such information is subject to an
     obligation of confidentiality, that disclosure of such information is
     permitted,

                  (iii)  to an Affiliate of such Lender, counsel, auditors,
     examiners of any regulatory authority having or reasonably asserting
     jurisdiction over such Lender, accountants and other consultants retained
     by Administrative Agent or any Lender or to any Affiliate of a Lender which
     is a direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements with
     the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower or such contractual
     counterparty's professional advisor (so long as such contractual
     counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty
     agrees to be bound by the provisions of this SECTION 12.16) or to the
     National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization
     or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to
     information about a Lender's investment portfolio in connection with rating
     issued with respect to such Lender,

                  (iv)   in connection with any litigation or the enforcement of
     the rights of any Lender or Administrative Agent under this Agreement or
     any other Loan Document,

                  (v)    to the extent (x) required by any applicable statute,
     rule or regulation or court order (including, without limitation, by way of
     subpoena) or pursuant

                                       110
<Page>

     to the request of any Governmental Authority having or reasonably asserting
     jurisdiction over any Lender or Administrative Agent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
     that in such event, if the Lender(s) are able to do so, the Lender shall
     provide Borrower with prompt notice of such requested disclosure so that
     Borrower may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and, in
     any event, the Lenders will endeavor in good faith to provide only that
     portion of such information which, in the reasonable judgment of the
     Lender(s), is relevant and legally required to be provided, (y) requested
     by any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to
     information about a Lender's investment portfolio in connection with rating
     issued with respect to such Lender or (z) requested by an Affiliate of a
     Lender which is a direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap
     agreements with the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower or such
     contractual counterparty's professional advisor (so long as such
     contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual
     counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this SECTION 12.16) or
     to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar
     organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires
     access to information about a Lender's investment portfolio in connection
     with rating issued with respect to such Lender,

                  (vi)   to the extent disclosure to other entities is
     appropriate in connection with any proposed or actual assignment or grant
     of a participation by any of the Lenders of interests in this Agreement
     and/or any of the other Loan Documents to such other entities (who will in
     turn be required to maintain confidentiality as if they were Lenders
     parties to this Agreement). In no event shall Administrative Agent or any
     Lender be obligated or required to return any such information or other
     materials furnished by Borrower.

          12.17   CONCERNING THE COLLATERAL AND THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

          (a)     AUTHORITY. Each Lender authorizes and directs DB to act as
Collateral Agent and to enter into the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral
for the benefit of the Lenders and the other secured parties. Each Lender agrees
that any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or,
where required by the express terms, hereof, a different proportion of the
Lenders) in accordance with the provisions hereof or of the other Loan
Documents, and the exercise by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
the Required Lenders (or, where so required, such different proportion) of the
powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the
Lenders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent as the case may be, shall have the sole and
exclusive right and authority to (i) act as the disbursing and collecting agent
for the Lenders with respect to all payments and collections arising in
connection herewith and with the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral; (ii)
execute and deliver each Loan Document relating to the Collateral and accept
delivery of each such agreement delivered by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iii) act as the Collateral Agent for the Lenders for purposes
stated therein to the extent such action is provided for under the Loan
Documents, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Administrative Agent hereby appoints,
authorizes and directs each Lender to act as collateral sub-agent for the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders for purposes of the perfection of all
security interests and Liens with respect to Borrower's and its Subsidiaries'
respective deposit

                                       111
<Page>

accounts maintained with, and cash and Cash Equivalents held by, such Lender;
(iv) manage, supervise and otherwise deal with the Collateral; (v) take such
action as is necessary or desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of
the security interests and liens created or purported to be created by the Loan
Documents; and (vi) except as may be otherwise specifically restricted by the
terms hereof or of any other Loan Document, exercise all remedies given to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect to the Collateral under the
Loan Documents relating thereto, applicable law or otherwise.

          (b)     RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.

                  (i)    The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby direct
     the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, to
     release, in accordance with the terms hereof, any Lien held by the
     Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, under
     the Security Documents (and, in the case of clause (B) below, release the
     affected Subsidiary from its guaranty):

                         (A)  against all of the Collateral, upon final and
          indefeasible payment in full of the Loans and Obligations and
          termination hereof;

                         (B)  against any part of the Collateral sold or
          disposed of by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than sales
          permitted under SECTION 8.6(e) but including, without limitation, in
          the case of a sale or disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a
          Subsidiary owned by Borrower and its Subsidiaries or the redesignation
          of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to
          an amendment hereto with the approval of the Required Lenders, all
          assets of such Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries and all Pledged
          Intercompany Notes issued by such Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries) to
          the extent such sale or disposition is permitted hereby (or permitted
          pursuant to a waiver or consent of a transaction otherwise prohibited
          hereby);

                         (C)  against any Collateral acquired by Borrower or any
          of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and at least 80% of the
          purchase price therefor is within 120 days of the acquisition thereof
          financed with Indebtedness secured by a Lien permitted by SECTION
          8.1(b)(i); and

                         (D)  against a part of the Collateral which release
          does not require the consent of all of the Lenders as set forth in
          SECTION 12.1(a)(iii)(B), if such release is consented to by the
          Required Lenders;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (y) the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
the case may be shall not be required to execute any such document on terms
which, in its opinion, would expose it to liability or create any obligation or
entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or
warranty, and (z) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or
impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of) all interests retained by Borrower and/or any of
its Subsidiaries, including (without limitation) the proceeds of any sale, all
of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

                                       112
<Page>

                  (ii)   Each of the Lenders hereby directs the Administrative
     Agent to execute and deliver or file such termination and partial release
     statements and such other things as are necessary to release Liens to be
     released pursuant to this SECTION 12.17 promptly upon the effectiveness of
     any such release or enter into intercreditor agreements contemplated or
     permitted herein.

          (c)     NO OBLIGATION. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall have any obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any
other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered
or that the Liens granted to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
herein or pursuant to the Loan Documents have been properly or sufficiently or
lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any
particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under
any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the
rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Administrative Agent
or the Collateral Agent in any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and
agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related
thereto, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may act in any manner
it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given the Administrative
Agent's own interests in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that neither
the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or
liability whatsoever to any Lender, provided, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be
responsible for their grossly negligent actions or actions constituting
intentional misconduct.

          (d)     PRIORITY CREDIT AGREEMENT LIEN SUBORDINATION. Each Lender
hereby instructs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into
the Security Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and such amendments or
modifications thereto and to the other Security Documents consistent herewith
and as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent reasonably determines to
be necessary to subordinate the Liens granted by Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries in favor of the Administrative Agent and Lenders to secure the
Obligations to the Liens granted pursuant to the Priority Loan Documents. Each
Lender agrees that, notwithstanding the time, order or method of attachment or
perfection of Liens granted in favor of the Collateral Agent and/or the Priority
Collateral Agent, to secure the Obligations and/or the Obligations (as defined
in the Priority Credit Agreement) or the filing or recording of financing
statements or other Security Documents and/or Security Documents (as defined in
the Priority Credit Agreement); the validity or enforceability of the security
interests and Liens granted in favor of the Priority Collateral Agent or the
Collateral Agent; any provisions of the UCC or any applicable law or decision;
any provision set forth in any Security Document and/or any Security Document
(as defined in the Priority Credit Agreement) in the possession or control by
the Priority Collateral Agent or the Collateral Agent of all or any part of any
Collateral as of the date hereof or otherwise, the Liens granted under the
Security Documents (as defined in the Priority Credit Agreement) shall be a
first and prior security interest for all purposes and the Liens granted under
the Security Documents to secure the Obligations shall be second and
subordinated to the liens granted under the Security Documents (as defined in
the Priority Credit Agreement). Each Lender agrees that it shall not challenge
or question in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of this SECTION
12.17(d) or any corresponding provisions with respect to lien subordination in
the Security Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement. Each Lender agrees that
it shall not challenge or question in any proceeding the priority or validity of
the liens

                                       113
<Page>

granted to the Administrative Agent, Lenders or the Collateral Agent to secure
the Obligations (as defined in the Priority Credit Agreement).

          (e)     TRANSFER RESTRICTION AGREEMENT. The Administrative Agent and
the Required Lenders (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement) and the
Required Lenders (as defined in the Original Term Loan Agreement) hereby permit
the contribution of the Capital Stock which is subject to the Transfer
Restriction Agreement dated as of December 20, 2001, by and among the Borrower,
Jon M. Huntsman and DB, to the Borrower on or before the Closing Date, without
the payment of any cash consideration, pursuant to SECTION 5.1(c)(ii).

          12.18   CERTAIN GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower hereby guarantees
all obligations of each of its Subsidiaries (for so long as such Subsidiary
remains a Subsidiary) under all Hedging Agreements entered into by such
Subsidiary with any Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender (even if such Person
subsequently ceases to be a Lender hereunder for any reason), which obligations
are pursuant to the terms of such Hedging Agreements expressly secured by the
security interests granted under the Security Agreement. The provisions of
Sections 4 through 9 of the Amended and Restated Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement
are hereby incorporated herein by reference MUTATIS MUTANDIS as if all
references to "Guarantor" and "Guaranteed Obligations" were references to
Borrower and the obligations guaranteed by this SECTION 12.18, respectively.

          12.19   STEERING COMMITTEE. No member of the Steering Committee (as
defined in the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement)
or any of such member's officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable
to the Borrower, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person for
any action taken or omitted by it hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents,
or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower shall, and to the extent that any
member of the Steering Committee is not reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower,
the Lenders shall reimburse and indemnify such member of the Steering Committee
for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against such member of the Steering Committee (or against such member's
officers, directors, employees or agents), acting in such capacity, in any way
relating to or arising out of any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or
omitted by the Steering Committee or such member of the Steering Committee under
any of the Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, in proportion
to each Lender's Aggregate Pro Rata Share; provided, however, that no Lender
shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from such member of the Steering Committee's gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

          12.20   EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective on the
date (the "Effective Date") on which (a) Borrower, Administrative Agent and each
of the Existing Lenders shall have signed a counterpart of this Agreement
(whether the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered the same
to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (or to Administrative Agent's
counsel as directed by such counsel) or, in the case of the Existing Lenders,
shall have given to Administrative Agent telephonic (confirmed in writing),
written, telex or facsimile notice (actually received) at such office or the
office of Administrative Agent's

                                       114
<Page>

counsel that the same has been signed and mailed to it or (b) upon the
occurrence of the Effective Date as defined in the Plan of Reorganization and
approved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Administrative Agent will give
Borrower and each Existing Lender prompt written notice of the occurrence of the
Effective Date.

          12.21   EFFECT OF AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT. Borrower, Administrative
Agent and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement and the
documents executed and delivered in connection herewith do not constitute a
novation, payment and reborrowing, or termination of the Obligations (as such
terms are defined in the Original Credit Agreement and the Original Term Loan
Agreement, each as in effect prior to the Closing Date (prior to giving effect
to the Transactions)) or a novation, payment and reborrowing of the Loans (as
such terms are defined in the Original Credit Agreement and the Original Term
Loan Agreement, each as in effect prior to the Closing Date (prior to giving
effect to the Transactions)) and (ii) the liens and security interests of the
Existing Lenders securing payment of the Obligations (as such term is defined in
the Original Credit Agreement and the Original Term Loan Agreement) are in all
respects continuing and in full force and effect with respect to the Obligations
hereunder. The security interest in, lien upon and/or conditional assignment of
rights and interest of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors granted to the
Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Agreement are hereby ratified and
shall continue from and after the date hereof and as such, shall remain in full
force and effect pursuant to the Security Agreement from and after the date
hereof.
