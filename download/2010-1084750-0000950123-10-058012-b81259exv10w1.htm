therefor, all as provided in this Section. Borrower may elect different options with respect to
different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated
ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising
each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Borrower shall not be entitled to request any conversion or continuation that, if made,

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank or
any such additional Issuing Bank. At the time any such resignation or replacement shall become

Letters of Credit outstanding on and after the date of delivery to the Administrative Agent of the
financial statements and certificates required by <U>Section&nbsp;5.01(a)</U> or <U>(b)</U> and
<U>Section&nbsp;5.01(d)</U>, respectively, indicating such change until the date immediately preceding
the next date of delivery of such financial statements and certificates indicating another such
change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to be in Level I (i)
from the Original Closing Date to the date of delivery to the Administrative Agent of the financial
statements and certificates required by <U>Section&nbsp;5.01(a)</U> or <U>(b)</U> and <U>Section
5.01(d)</U> for the fiscal period ended at least six months after the Original Closing Date, (ii)
at any time during which Borrower has failed to deliver the financial statements and certificates
required by <U>Section&nbsp;5.01(a)</U> or <U>(b)</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;5.01(d)</U>, respectively, and

Section&nbsp;5.01 is shown to be inaccurate (regardless of whether this Agreement or the Commitments are
in effect when such inaccuracy is discovered), and such inaccuracy, if corrected would have led to
a higher Applicable Margin for any period (an &#147;<B>Applicable Period</B>&#148;) than the Applicable Margin
applied for such Applicable Period, then (i)&nbsp;Borrower shall immediately deliver to the
Administrative Agent a correct Compliance Certificate for such Applicable Period, (ii)&nbsp;the
Applicable Margin shall be determined as if Level I were applicable for such Applicable Period, and
(iii)&nbsp;Borrower shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent the additional interest owing as a
result of such increased Applicable Margin for such Applicable Period, which payment shall be
promptly applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof. This paragraph
shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder.

rent or any other charges which may be due to Landlord against the Collateral, and any and all

entering upon or into the Premises, Collateral Agent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments, liabilities, costs and expenses

taking any of the foregoing actions with respect to the Collateral. Such costs shall be limited to
any damage to the Premises made by Collateral Agent in severing and/or removing the Collateral
therefrom and will not include any consequential damages. Collateral Agent shall not be liable for

expiration of the Lease or termination thereof due to the default of Tenant thereunder), Landlord
will deliver notice (the &#147;Landlord&#146;s Notice&#148;) to Collateral Agent to that effect. Within the

Collateral to be removed from the Premises. During such 120-day period, Landlord will not remove
the Collateral from the Premises nor interfere with Collateral Agent&#146;s actions in removing the
Collateral from the Premises or Collateral Agent&#146;s actions in otherwise enforcing its security
interest in the Collateral. Upon the request of Collateral Agent made on or prior to the end of
the Standstill Period, Landlord agrees to enter into a new lease with Collateral Agent (or its
nominee) on the same terms and conditions as the Lease provided Collateral Agent has theretofore

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4.1. <U>Title</U>. Except for the security interest granted to the Collateral Agent for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 4.2. <U>Validity of Security Interest</U>. The security interest in and Lien on the
Pledged Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties hereunder

adverse to the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party other than Permitted Liens. There is no
agreement, order, judgment or decree, and no Pledgor shall enter into any agreement or take any
other action, that would restrict the transferability of any of the Pledged Collateral or otherwise
impair or conflict with such Pledgor&#146;s obligations or the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3. <U>Entitlement Order</U>. If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall
receive an &#147;entitlement order&#148; (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;8-102(a)(8) of the UCC) issued by the
Collateral Agent and relating to any financial asset maintained in one or more of the Designated
Accounts, the Securities Intermediary shall comply with such entitlement order without further
consent by the Pledgor or any other person. The Securities Intermediary shall also comply with
instructions directing the Securities Intermediary with respect to the sale, exchange or transfer
of any Account Property held in each Designated Account originated by a Pledgor, or any
representative of, or investment manager appointed by, a Pledgor until such time as the Collateral
Agent delivers a Notice of Sole Control pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;9(i)</U> to the Securities
Intermediary. The Securities Intermediary shall comply with, and is fully entitled to rely upon,
any entitlement order from the Collateral Agent, even if such entitlement order is contrary to any
entitlement order that the Pledgor may give or may have given to the Securities Intermediary.

hereby agrees that any security interest in, lien on, encumbrance, claim or (except as provided in
the next sentence) right of setoff against, any Designated Account or any Account Property it now
has or subsequently obtains shall be subordinate to the security interest of the Collateral Agent
in the Designated Accounts and the Account Property therein or credited thereto. The Securities
Intermediary agrees not to exercise any present or future right of recoupment or set-off against
any of the Designated Accounts or to assert against any of the Designated Accounts any present or
future security interest, banker&#146;s lien or any other lien or claim (including claim for penalties)
that the Securities Intermediary may at any time have against or in any of the Designated Accounts
or any Account Property therein or credited thereto; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the
Securities Intermediary may set off all amounts due to the Securities Intermediary in respect of
its customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and operation of the Designated
Accounts, including overdraft fees and amounts advanced to settle authorized transactions.

shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Regardless of any provision in any other
agreement, for purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the Securities Intermediary&#146;s
jurisdiction and the Designated Accounts (as well as the security entitlements related thereto)
shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

are no other agreements entered into between the Securities Intermediary and the Pledgor with
respect to any Designated Account or any security entitlements or other financial assets credited
thereto (other than standard and customary documentation with respect to the establishment and
maintenance of such Designated Accounts). The Securities Intermediary and the Pledgor will not
enter into any other agreement with respect to any Designated Account unless the Collateral Agent
shall have received prior written notice thereof. The Securities Intermediary and the Pledgor have
not and will not enter into any other agreement with respect to (i)&nbsp;creation or perfection of any
security interest in or (ii)&nbsp;control of security entitlements maintained

accurately reflects the assets held in such Designated Account as of the date thereof.

Account a notation with respect to any such financial asset so that such records and reports
generated with respect thereto identify such financial asset as &#147;Pledged.&#148;

interest in, lien on, or encumbrance against, any Designated Account or Account Property held in or
credited thereto and does not know of any claim that any person or entity other than the Collateral
Agent has been given &#147;control&#148; (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;8-106 of the UCC) of any Designated
Account or any such Account Property. If the Securities Intermediary becomes aware that any person
or entity is asserting any lien, encumbrance, security interest or adverse claim (including any
writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process or any claim of
control) against any of the Account Property held in or credited to any Designated Account, the
Securities Intermediary shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent and the Pledgor thereof.

the Securities Intermediary a notice instructing the Securities Intermediary to terminate
Pledgor&#146;s access to any Designated Account (the &#147;<U>Notice of Sole Control</U>&#148;), the
Securities Intermediary agrees that, after receipt of such notice, it will take all

terminate all instructions and orders originated by the Pledgor with respect to the
Designated Accounts or any Account Property therein, and cease taking instructions from
Pledgor, including, without limitation, instructions for investment, distribution or
transfer of any financial asset maintained in any Designated Account. Permitting settlement
of trades pending at the time of receipt of such notice shall not constitute a violation of
the immediately preceding sentence.

hereof. The Securities Intermediary will provide to the Collateral Agent, upon the
Collateral Agent&#146;s request therefor from time to time and, in any event, as of the last

maintained in each Designated Account. The Securities Intermediary shall not change the

Designated Accounts, the Securities Intermediary shall retain possession of the same on
behalf and for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and such act shall cause the Securities
Intermediary to be deemed holding such certificate for the Collateral Agent, if necessary to
perfect the Collateral Agent&#146;s security interest in such securities or assets. The

<U>Accounts</U>. The Bank hereby confirms and agrees that (i)&nbsp;the Bank has established for the
Pledgor and maintains the deposit account(s) listed in <U>Schedule&nbsp;1</U> annexed hereto (such
account(s), together with each such other deposit account maintained by the Pledgor with the Bank
collectively, the &#147;<U>Designated Accounts</U>&#148; and each a &#147;<U>Designated Account</U>&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;each

for the Pledgor being required, including, without limitation, directing disposition of the funds
in each Designated Account. The Bank shall also comply with instructions directing the disposition
of funds in each Designated Account originated by the Pledgor or its authorized representatives
until such time as the Collateral Agent delivers a Notice of Sole Control pursuant to <U>Section
8(i)</U> hereof to the Bank. The Bank shall comply with, and is fully entitled to rely upon, any
instruction from the Collateral Agent, even if such instruction is contrary to any instruction that
the Pledgor may give or may have given to the Bank.

security interest in, lien on, encumbrance, claim or (except as provided in the next sentence)
right of setoff against, any Designated Account or any funds therein it now has or subsequently
obtains shall be subordinate to the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Designated
Accounts and the funds therein or credited thereto. The Bank agrees not to exercise any present or
future right of recoupment or set-off against any of the Designated Accounts or to assert against
any of the Designated Accounts any present or future security interest, banker&#146;s lien or any other
lien or claim (including claim for penalties) that the Bank may at any time have against or in any
of the Designated Accounts or any funds therein; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Bank

Collateral Agent shall have received prior written notice thereof. The Bank and the Pledgor have
not and will not enter into any other agreement with respect to control of the Designated Accounts
or purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the Bank to comply with any orders or
instructions with respect to any Designated Account as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;2</U> hereof
without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent acting in its sole discretion. In the
event of any conflict with respect to control over any Designated Account between this Control
Agreement (or any portion hereof) and any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into,
the terms of this Control Agreement shall prevail. No amendment or modification of this Control
Agreement or waiver of any right hereunder shall be binding on any party hereto unless it is in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7. <U>Notice of Adverse Claims</U>. Except for the claims and interest of the
Secured Parties and of the Pledgor in the Designated Accounts, the Bank on the date hereof does not
know of any claim to, security interest in, lien on, or encumbrance against, any Designated Account
or in any funds credited thereto and does not know of any claim that any person or entity other
than the Collateral Agent has been given control (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;9-104 of the UCC)
of any Designated Account or any such funds. If the Bank becomes aware that any person or entity
is asserting any lien, encumbrance, security interest or adverse claim (including any writ,
garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process or any claim of control)
against any funds in any Designated Account, the Bank shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent
and the Pledgor thereof.

</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Notice of Sole Control</U>. If at any time the Collateral Agent delivers to
the Bank a notice instructing the Bank to terminate Pledgor&#146;s access to any Designated
Account (the &#147;<U>Notice of Sole Control</U>&#148;), the Bank agrees that, after receipt of such
notice, it will take all instruction with respect to such Designated Account solely from the
Collateral Agent, terminate all instructions and orders originated by the Pledgor with
respect to the Designated Accounts or any funds therein, and cease taking instructions from
the Pledgor, including, without limitation, instructions for distribution or transfer of any
funds in any Designated Account.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) <U>Statements and Confirmations</U>. The Bank will send copies of all statements

<U>Section&nbsp;10</U> hereof. The Bank will promptly provide to the Collateral Agent, upon
request therefor from time to time and, in any event, as of the last business day of each
calendar month, a statement of the cash balance in each Designated Account. The Bank shall
not change the name or account number of any Designated Account without the prior written
consent of the Collateral Agent.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. We express no opinion as to the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
collect any payment to the extent that such payment constitutes a penalty, forfeiture or late
charge.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. We have assumed that (i)&nbsp;any consideration contemplated to be given under the
Security Agreement was given at the time of the delivery and execution of such document, (ii)
the Collateral (other than property which becomes Collateral after the date hereof) exists and
the applicable Loan Party has &#147;rights&#148; in such Collateral existing on the date hereof and will
have &#147;rights&#148; in property which becomes Collateral after the date hereof, in each case as
contemplated by the New York UCC, (iii)&nbsp;each of the Loan Parties has received &#147;value&#148; (as
defined in the New York UCC), (iv)&nbsp;the descriptions of Collateral in the Security Agreement
and the Financing Statements reasonably describe the property intended to be described as
Collateral, (v)&nbsp;all information regarding the secured party on the Financing Statements is
accurate and complete in all respects, and (vi)&nbsp;the representations in the Credit Documents,
including, without limitation, the information on any of the exhibits and schedules thereto,
regarding the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Loan Parties are accurate and complete as
of the date of the filing of the Financing Statements. We have made no examination of, and no
opinion is given herein as to, any parties&#146; respective title to, or other ownership rights in,
or the existence of any liens, charges or encumbrances on, or adverse
claims against, the Collateral, other than the security interests in favor of the
Administrative Agent as contemplated by the Security Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Our opinions are subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;9-203 of the New York UCC
relating to the time of attachment. We have assumed that no agreement exists that postpones
attachment or conveyance of, or modifies, releases or terminates, the interests of the
Administrative Agent in the Collateral or that would expand, modify or otherwise affect the
respective rights and obligations of the parties to the Security Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Any security interest in any Collateral or proceeds of any Collateral is limited to
the extent set forth in Section&nbsp;9-315 of the New York UCC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. We express no opinion as to the priority of any security interest over any other or
competing interest in the Collateral.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. With respect to property as to which the security interests purported to be granted
pursuant to the Security Agreement attach after the date thereof or hereof, we call to your
attention that Section&nbsp;552 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (to the extent, if any, that
such section is relevant to any Loan Party) limits the extent to which assets

commencement of such case.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. We express no opinion as to the applicability of Section&nbsp;548 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or of any provisions of any state fraudulent conveyance statute or law to the
transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. We express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
provision of any Credit Document that purports to waive, release or vary any right of, or any
duties owing to, a party to the extent limited by Sections&nbsp;1-102(3), 9-601, 9-602 or 9-603 of
the New York UCC or other provisions of applicable law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. We call to your attention that Section&nbsp;9-108(c) of the New York UCC provides that
supergeneric descriptions are insufficient to create a valid security interest and that
Section&nbsp;9-108(e)(1) of the New York UCC provides that a description of commercial tort claims
by type only is insufficient to create a valid security interest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. We express no opinion with respect to any Collateral which is subject to a
certificate of title or a document of title.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K. We express no opinion with respect to any Collateral which constitutes goods which
are an accession to, or commingled or processed with other goods to the extent that the
security interest of the Administrative Agent is limited by Section&nbsp;9-335 or 9-336 of the New
York UCC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L. In the case of any chattel paper, account or general intangible which is itself
secured by other property, we express no opinion with respect to any Loan Party&#146;s rights in
and to such underlying collateral.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M. We call to your attention that (i)&nbsp;the perfection of the security interest in any
Collateral described in any Financing Statement may be terminated as to any Collateral
acquired subsequent to a change in the name, nature, corporate structure or identity of any
Loan Party and may otherwise be affected by the matters set forth in Sections&nbsp;9-316, 9-507 and
9-508 of the Delaware UCC and (ii)&nbsp;the Delaware UCC requires the filing of continuation
statements within the period six months prior to the expiration of five years from the date of
the original filing of the Financing Statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N. We express no opinion with respect to any Collateral consisting of claims against any
government or governmental agency (including, without limitation, the United States of America
or any state thereof or any agency or department of the United States of America or any state
thereof). We call to your attention that the perfection and the effect of perfection and
non-perfection of the security interests in favor of the Administrative Agent
