Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of  such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between  the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur.  (b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with the issuance, amendment  or extension of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, an amount, such as a  required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but Letter of Credit is denominated  in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant equivalent amount of such Dollar  Amount in Alternative Currency (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with  0.5 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or the applicable  L/C Issuer, as the case may be.

For all purposes under the Credit Documents, in connection with any division or  plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction&#8217;s  laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right,  obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from  the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such  new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders  of its capital stock at such time.  SECTION 2 Amount and Terms of Credit  2.1 Revolving Credit Borrowing  (a) The Revolving Credit Borrowings.  Subject to the terms and conditions set  forth herein, each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit loans (each  such loan, a &#8220;Revolving Credit Loan&#8221;) to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day  after the Closing Date until the Maturity Date, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at  any time outstanding the amount of such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that  after giving effect to any such Revolving Credit Borrowing, each of the Availability Requirements  shall be met.  Revolving Credit Loans shall be made to the Borrower in Dollars.  Revolving Credit  Loans to the Borrower denominated in Dollars may be ABR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as  further provided herein.  Within the limits of each Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Commitment, and  subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section  2.1(a), prepay under Section 2.5 and reborrow under this Section 2.1(a).  (b) Subject to the limitations set forth below (and notwithstanding anything to  the contrary in Section 2.1(a) or in Error! Unknown switch argument.), the Administrative  Agent is authorized by the Borrower and the Revolving Credit Lenders, from time to time in the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s sole discretion (but shall have absolutely no obligation), to make loans  denominated in Dollars that are ABR Loans (each such loan, a &#8220;Protective Advance&#8221;) on behalf  of all Revolving Credit Lenders to the Borrower at any time that any condition precedent set forth  in Section 7 has not been satisfied or waived, which the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted  Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (x) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion  thereof or (y) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans  and other Obligations.  Any Protective Advance may be made in a principal amount that would  result in the Availability Requirements not being met; provided that no Protective Advance may  be made to the extent that, after giving effect to such Protective Advance (together with the     75  Outstanding Amount of any other outstanding Protective Advances) the aggregate Outstanding  Amount of all Protective Advances outstanding hereunder would exceed 5% of the Borrowing  Base as determined on the date of such proposed Protective Advance; provided further that the  Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at such time shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving  Credit Commitments as then in effect.  Each Protective Advance shall be secured by the Liens in  favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in and to the Collateral and  shall constitute Obligations hereunder.  The Administrative Agent&#8217;s authorization to make  Protective Advances may be revoked at any time by the Required Lenders.  Any such revocation  must be in writing and will become effective prospectively upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s  receipt thereof.  The making of a Protective Advance on any one occasion shall not obligate the  Administrative Agent to make any Protective Advance on any other occasion and under no  circumstance shall the Borrower have the right to require that a Protective Advance be made.  At  any time that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7 have been satisfied or waived, the  Administrative Agent may request the Revolving Credit Lenders to make a Revolving Credit Loan  to repay a Protective Advance.  At any other time, the Administrative Agent may require the  Appropriate Lenders to fund their risk participations described in Section 2.1(c) below.  (c) Upon the making of a Protective Advance by the Administrative Agent  (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default), each Revolving Credit  Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, unconditionally and  irrevocably to have purchased from the Administrative Agent, without recourse or warranty, an  undivided interest and participation in such Protective Advance in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.   From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender is required to fund its participation in any  Protective Advance purchased hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to  such Lender, such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of all payments of principal and interest and all  proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent in respect of such Protective Advance.  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Credit Document, but  subject to Section 2.12, each Lender may, at its option, make Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line  Loans or Protective Advances, as applicable, available to the Borrower by causing its applicable  Lending Office or any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loans;  provided that (i) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay  such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and  (ii) no Credit Party shall be obliged to make any payment pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 5.4 (or  the comparable provisions in Section 14) in excess of any payment that would have been due to  Lender pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4 (or the comparable provisions under Section 14),  respectively, if the Lender had made such Loan through its Lending Office (other than (i) Loans  made through any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of a Lender at the written request of the  Borrower or (ii) payments as a result of any change after the exercise of such option in (or in the  interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or treaty or any published practice or  published concession of any relevant taxing authority).  (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund  participations in Letters of Credit, Swing Line Loans and Protective Advances are several and not  joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date  required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on     76  such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its  Loan or purchase its participation.  2.2 Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing; Maximum Number of Borrowings  (a) Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans  shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of the amount of $500,000 in  excess thereof.  (b) Except as provided in Sections 3.1(c) and 3.2(c), and except for Protective  Advances which shall be made in the amounts required by Section 2.1(b), each Borrowing of or  conversion to ABR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of the  amount of $100,000 in excess thereof.  (c) After giving effect to all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of  Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Credit  Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than 10 Interest Periods in effect unless otherwise  agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  2.3 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations  (a) Each Revolving Credit Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Credit  Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be made upon  the Borrower&#8217;s revocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.   Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent (i) not later than 12:00 noon (New  York, New York time) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or  continuation of Term SOFR Loans or any conversion of ABR Loans to Term SOFR Loans, and  (ii) not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York, New York time) on the requested date of any Borrowing  of ABR Loans.  Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) must be  confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Notice of Borrowing or  Notice of Conversion or Continuation, appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized  Officer of the Borrower.  Each Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation  (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Revolving  Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, or a  continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or  continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of  Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) [reserved], (v) the Type of Loans to be  borrowed or to which existing Revolving Credit Loans are to be converted, (vi) [reserved] and  (vii) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto.  If the Borrower fails to  specify a Type of Loan in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation or fails  to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving  Credit Loans shall be made as, or converted to ABR Loans.  Any such automatic conversion to  ABR Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to  the applicable Term SOFR Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or  continuation of Term SOFR Loans in any such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or  Continuation, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest  Period of one (1) month.    </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">   77  (b) Following receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall  promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable  Revolving Credit Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the  Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic  conversion to ABR Loans.  In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make  the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the  Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time), in each case  on the Business Day specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.  Upon satisfaction of the  applicable conditions set forth in Section 7, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so  received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by  (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount  of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions  provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided  that if, on the date the Notice of Borrowing with respect to a Borrowing is given by the Borrower,  there are L/C Borrowings in respect of Letters of Credit outstanding, then the proceeds of such  Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings and second,  to the Borrower as provided above.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the  Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans upon  determination of such interest rate.  The determination of Term SOFR by the Administrative Agent  shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  At any time that ABR Loans are outstanding,  the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders of any change in  the Administrative Agent&#8217;s prime rate used in determining the ABR promptly following the public  announcement of such change.  (d) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued  or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan.  During the  existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require  that no Loans may be converted or continued as Term SOFR Loans.  2.4 Disbursement of Funds  (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an  Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make  available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing, the  Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share available to the  Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.3(b) above, and  the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower  on such date a corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds  available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such Pro Rata Share available  to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and Borrower severally agrees to repay to the  Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest  thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date  such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest  rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such  Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing, or similar fees customarily     78  charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing.  A certificate of the  Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this  Section 2.4(a) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If the Borrower and such  Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period,  the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower (to the extent such amount is  covered by interest paid by such Lender) the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such  period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent,  then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any  payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against  a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  (b) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its  obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may  have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood,  however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its  commitments hereunder).  2.5 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt  (a) Revolving Credit Loans.  The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative  Agent for the ratable account of the Appropriate Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate  principal amount of all of its Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such date.  (b) Swing Line Loans.  The Borrower shall repay each of its Swing Line Loans  on the Maturity Date.  (c) Protective Advances.  The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative  Agent the then unpaid amount of each of its Protective Advances on the Maturity Date.  (d) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account  or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the appropriate Lending Office of such  Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lending Office of such Lender from time to time,  including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lending Office of such  Lender from time to time under this Agreement.  (e) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section  13.6(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together)  shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and, if applicable, the relevant  tranche thereof and the Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the  amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the  Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative  Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender&#8217;s share thereof.  (f) The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts maintained  pursuant to clauses (d) and (e) of this Section 2.5 shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,  be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein  recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to  maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall     79  not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the  Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  (g) The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon request of any Lender at any time  and from time to time after the Borrower has made an initial Borrowing hereunder, the Borrower  shall provide to such Lender, at the Borrower&#8217;s expense a promissory note substantially in the  form of Exhibit B, evidencing the Loans owing to such Lender.  Each Lender may attach schedules  to its note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and  payments with respect thereto.  2.6 [Reserved]  2.7 [Reserved]  2.8 Interest  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.8(b), (i) each Term SOFR Loan  denominated in Dollars shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each  Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period plus the  Applicable Rate and (ii) each ABR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount  thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the  Applicable Rate.    (b) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all amounts  (other than any such amount owed to a Defaulting Lender) shall bear interest at a rate per annum  (the &#8220;Default Rate&#8221;) that is (x) in the case of principal, the rate that would otherwise be applicable  thereto plus 2% or (y) in the case of any other amounts due hereunder, to the extent permitted by  Applicable Law, the rate described in Section Error! Reference source not found. plus 2% from  the date such Event of Default shall have occurred to the date on which such Event of Default is  no longer continuing or such amount is paid in full (after as well as before judgment).  (c) Interest on each Loan shall accrue from and including the date of any  Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof; provided that any Loan that is  repaid on the same date on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.  Except as provided  below, interest shall be payable (i) in respect of each ABR Loan, quarterly in arrears on the first  Business Day of each April, July, October and January, (ii) in respect of each Term SOFR Loan,  on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) in respect of each Loan, (A) on  any prepayment; provided that interest on ABR Loans shall only become due pursuant to this  clause (A) if the aggregate principal amount of the ABR Loans then-outstanding is repaid in full,  (B) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and (C) after such maturity, on demand.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, interest payable pursuant to Section 2.8(b) shall  be payable on demand.  (d) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with  Section 5.5.     80  2.9 Interest Periods  At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or  Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion into or continuation as, a Borrowing of  Term SOFR Loans in accordance with Section 2.3(a), the Borrower shall give the Administrative  Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the Interest Period  applicable to such Borrowing, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one  or three month period.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:  (a) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans shall  commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a Borrowing  of ABR Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall  commence on the day on which the preceding Interest Period expires;  (b) if any Interest Period relating to a Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans begins  on the last Business Day of a calendar month or begins on a day for which there is no numerically  corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period  shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;  (c) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business  Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided that if any  Interest Period in respect of a Term SOFR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a  Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,  such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and  (d) the Borrower shall not be entitled to elect any Interest Period in respect of  any Term SOFR Loan if such Interest Period would extend beyond the Maturity Date.  2.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, Etc.  (a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent  or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, the Required Lenders shall have reasonably  determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive  and binding upon all parties hereto):  (i) on any date for determining Term SOFR for any Interest  Period that (x) deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising such Borrowing  are not generally available in the relevant market or (y) by reason of any changes arising  on or after the Closing Date affecting the market for such rate, adequate and fair means do  not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the  definition of Term SOFR; or  (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or  reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Term SOFR  Loans (other than any increase or reduction attributable to (A) Indemnified Taxes and  Taxes indemnifiable under Section 5.4 (or the comparable provisions under Section 14),  </FONT></DIV>

Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Term SOFR Loans shall no longer be available until  such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders that the  circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist (which notice  the Administrative Agent agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no longer exist),  and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion or Continuation given by the Borrower with  respect to Term SOFR Loans that have not yet been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the  Borrower, as applicable, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender,  promptly after receipt of written demand therefor such additional amounts (in the form of an  increased rate of or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise, as such Lender in its  reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such  increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed that a written notice  as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the  calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable  error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii)  above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as  possible and, in any event, within the time period required by Applicable Law.  (b) At any time that any Term SOFR Loan is affected by the circumstances  described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a Term SOFR Loan  affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (x) if the affected Term SOFR Loan is then  being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel such Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent  telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was  notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the affected Term SOFR Loan  is then-outstanding, upon at least three Business Days&#8217; notice to the Administrative Agent require  the affected Lender to convert each Term SOFR Loan into an ABR Loan; provided that if more  than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated in the same  manner pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).     82  (c) If, after the Closing Date, any Change in Law relating to capital adequacy  or liquidity of any Lender or compliance by any Lender or its parent with any Change in Law  relating to capital adequacy or liquidity occurring after the Closing Date, has or would have the  effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#8217;s or its parent&#8217;s or its Affiliates&#8217; capital or  assets as a consequence of such Lender&#8217;s commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below  that which such Lender or its parent or any Affiliate thereof could have achieved but for such  Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s or parent&#8217;s policies with respect to capital  adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time, promptly after written demand by such Lender  (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction, it being  understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation as a  result of such Lender&#8217;s compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with,  any Applicable Law as in effect on the Closing Date.  Each Lender, upon determining in good  faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), will give prompt  written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of  the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not,  subject to Section 2.13, release or diminish the Borrower&#8217;s obligations to pay additional amounts  pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall demand compensation  pursuant to this Section 2.10 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such  Lender to demand such compensation in substantially the same manner as applied to other  similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities.  2.11 Compensation  If (i) any payment of principal of any Term SOFR Loan is made by the Borrower  to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Term  SOFR Loan as a result of a payment or conversion pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.10, 5.1, 5.2 or 13.7,  as a result of acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to 10.14 or for any other reason,  (ii) any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans is not made as a result of a withdrawn Notice of  Borrowing, (iii) any ABR Loan is not converted into a Term SOFR Loan as a result of a withdrawn  Notice of Conversion or Continuation, (iv) any Term SOFR Loan is not continued as a Term SOFR  Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Conversion or Continuation or (v) any prepayment of  principal of any Term SOFR Loan is not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment  pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Borrower shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender  (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount), pay to the  Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such  Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may reasonably incur as a  result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or failure to prepay, including any  loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the  liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain  such Term SOFR Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall demand compensation  pursuant to this Section 2.11 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such  Lender to demand such compensation in substantially the same manner as applied to other  similarly situated borrowers under comparable syndicated credit facilities.     83  2.12 Change of Lending Office  Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the  operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii), 2.10(a)(iii), 2.10(c) or 5.4 (or the comparable provisions under  Section 14) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts  (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another Lending Office for  any Loans affected by such event; provided that such designation is made on such terms that such  Lender and its Lending Office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object  of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any such Section.  Nothing  in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of  any Lender provided in Section 2.10 or 5.4 (or the comparable provisions under Section 14).  The  Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in  connection with such designation.  2.13 Notice of Certain Costs  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice  required by Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4 (or the comparable provisions in Section 14) is given by any  Lender more than 180 days after such Lender has knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of  the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or  other additional amounts described in such Sections, such Lender shall not be entitled to  compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4 (or the comparable provisions under Section 14), as  the case may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the 181st day prior to the  giving of such notice to the Borrower (except that, if the event giving rise to such additional cost,  reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts is retroactive, then the 180-day period  referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  2.14 Incremental Credit Extensions  (a) Incremental Revolving Credit Request.  The Borrower may at any time and  from time to time, on one or more occasions, after the Closing Date, by notice to the Administrative  Agent, request one or more increases to the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit  Commitments (the &#8220;Incremental Commitments&#8221;).    (b) The aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Commitments  hereunder, together with the then-existing Revolving Credit Commitments, shall not exceed  $200,000,000.  Each Incremental Commitment will be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and  in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser minimum amount  approved by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided that such amount  may be less than such minimum amount or integral multiple amount if such amount represents all  the remaining availability under the limit set forth above.  (c) Incremental Lenders.  Incremental Commitments may be provided by any  existing Lender (it being understood that no existing Lender will have an obligation to make all or  any portion of the Incremental Commitments, nor will the Borrower have any obligation to  approach any existing Lender(s) to provide any Incremental Commitments) or by any Additional  Lender on terms permitted by this Section 2.14; provided that the Administrative Agent, the Swing     84  Line Lender and each L/C Issuer shall have consented (in each case, such consent not to be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to any such Person&#8217;s providing Incremental  Commitments if such consent would be required under Section 13.6(b)(ii) for an assignment of  Revolving Credit Commitments to such Person.  Final allocations of Incremental Commitments  will be made by the Borrower together with the arrangers thereof, if any, in their discretion.  (d) Incremental Amendments.  Incremental Commitments shall become  Revolving Credit Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (each, an  &#8220;Incremental Amendment&#8221;) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Credit Documents,  executed by the Borrower, each Person providing such Incremental Commitments and the  Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender as to the  effectiveness of each Incremental Amendment.  Incremental Amendments may, without the  consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative  Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.14.  Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that,  upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Amendment, this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents, as applicable, will be amended to the extent necessary to reflect the existence and  terms of the Incremental Commitments.  (e) Conditions.  The availability of the Incremental Commitments under this  Agreement will be subject solely to the following conditions:  (i) No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would  exist after giving effect thereto; and  (ii) all representations and warranties set forth in Section 8 and the other  Credit Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of  effectiveness of the Incremental Commitments except any representations and warranties  which expressly relate to a given date or period shall be required only to be true and correct  in all material respects as of the respective date or for the respective period, as the case  may be, provided that, any representation and warranty that is qualified as to &#8220;materiality,&#8221;  &#8220;Material Adverse Effect&#8221; or similar language shall be true and correct (after giving effect  to any qualification therein) in all respects on such respective dates.  (f) Terms.  All Incremental Commitments shall be on the same terms  (including as to maturity and guarantee and collateral) and pursuant to the same documentation  applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitments.  (g) Pricing.  Other than upfront fees paid upon the effectiveness of the  Incremental Commitments, the pricing in respect of the Incremental Commitments shall be  identical to the existing Revolving Credit Commitments.  (h) [Reserved]  (i) Reallocation of Revolving Credit Exposure.  Upon the effectiveness of the  Incremental Commitments:  </FONT></DIV>

(j) The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum  borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this  Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this Section 2.14.  2.15 Conversion to Exit ABL Facility  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, upon the satisfaction or waiver by  each Lender of each of the conditions set forth in Annex I, automatically and without any further  consent or action required by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Secured Party,  (i) the Borrower and each other Credit Party shall be deemed to have assumed all obligations in  respect of the Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder and all other monetary obligations in respect  hereof, (ii) each Loan and Letter of Credit hereunder shall be continued as a loan or letter of credit  under the Exit ABL Facility, (iii) each Lender hereunder shall be a lender under the Exit ABL  Facility and (iv) this Agreement shall terminate and be superseded and replaced in its entirety by,  and deemed amended and restated in its entirety in the form of, the Exit ABL Facility (with such  changes and insertions thereto, as are reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, the Lenders and the  Borrower, incorporated as necessary to make any technical changes necessary to effectuate the  intent of this Section 2.15), and each of the Commitments hereunder shall automatically become  Exit ABL Commitments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all obligations of the Borrower and the  other Credit Parties to the Agents, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders under this Agreement and any  other Credit Document which are expressly stated in this Agreement or such other Credit  Document as surviving such agreement&#8217;s termination shall, as so specified, survive without  prejudice and remain in full force and effect.  Each of the Credit Parties, the Agents, the Lenders  and the L/C Issuers shall take such actions and execute and deliver such agreements, instruments  or other documents reasonably required to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.15 and as  are required to complete the schedules to the Exit ABL Facility or other agreements contemplated     86  thereby.  For the avoidance of doubt, the conversion of the Commitments into commitments under  the Exit ABL Facility shall not require the delivery of audited financial statements of the Borrower  or any other Credit Party (or their predecessors) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 2.15 shall cease to apply if the Commitments have  been terminated.    2.16 Defaulting Lender  (a) Reallocation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Lender  becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the following provisions shall  apply with respect to any outstanding Protective Advance participation pursuant to Section 2.1(c),  any outstanding Letter of Credit participation pursuant to Section 3.1 and Swing Line Loan  participation pursuant to Section 3.2 of such Defaulting Lender:  (i) the Protective Advance participation pursuant to Section 2.1(c), the  Letter of Credit participation pursuant to Section 3.1 and the Swing Line Loan participation  pursuant to Section 3.2, in each case, of such Defaulting Lender will, subject to the  limitation in the proviso below, automatically be reallocated (effective on the day such  Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Non-Defaulting Lenders who are  Revolving Credit Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit  Commitments; provided that, in each case above, (a) the Revolving Credit Exposure of  each Non-Defaulting Lender may not in any event exceed its Revolving Credit  Commitment as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (b) neither such reallocation  nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or  release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, the Swing  Line Lender or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such  Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender; and  (ii) to the extent that any portion (the &#8220;unreallocated portion&#8221;) of any  Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Letter of Credit participation pursuant to Section 3.1 and Swing Line  Loan participation pursuant to Section 3.2 cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of  the proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the Borrower will, not later than two Business  Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the relevant L/C Issuer  and/or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be), (1) L/C Cash Collateralize the  obligations of the Borrower to the relevant L/C Issuer in respect of such Letter of Credit  participation pursuant to Section 3.1, in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the  unreallocated portion of such Letter of Credit participation pursuant to Section 3.1, or (2)  in the case of such Swing Line Loan participation pursuant to Section 3.2, prepay and/or  L/C Cash Collateralize in full the unreallocated portion thereof, or (3) make other  arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the relevant L/C Issuer and  the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, in their sole discretion to protect them against  the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender.  (b) Fees.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period  as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender will not be entitled to any fees accruing  during such period pursuant to Section 3.1(i) (without prejudice to the rights of the Lenders other  than Defaulting Lenders in respect of such fees); provided that in the case of any such Defaulting     87  Lender that was or is a Lender (x) to the extent that a portion of the Letter of Credit participation  pursuant to Section 3.1 of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated to the applicable Non-Defaulting  Lenders pursuant to Section 2.16(a) above, such fees under Section 3.1(i) that would have accrued  for the benefit of such Defaulting Lender will instead accrue for the benefit of and be payable to  such Non-Defaulting Lenders, pro rata in accordance with their applicable Revolving Credit  Commitments and (y) to the extent any portion of such Letter of Credit participation pursuant to  Section 3.1 cannot be so reallocated, such fees will instead accrue for the benefit of and be payable  to the relevant L/C Issuer, as their interests appear.  (c) Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer and the  Swing Line Lender agree in writing in their discretion that a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender  should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify  the parties hereto, whereupon (as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any  conditions set forth therein), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase such portion of  outstanding Loans of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative  Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments,  Revolving Credit Loans, Letter of Credit participations pursuant to Section 3.1 and Swing Line  Loan participations pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Lenders to be on a pro rata basis in accordance  with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a  Defaulting Lender and will be a Non-Defaulting Lender (and such Revolving Credit Commitments  and Loans of each Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the  foregoing); provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued  or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender;  and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties,  no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver  or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender&#8217;s having been a Defaulting  Lender.  2.17 Reserves  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Administrative Agent may at any  time and from time to time in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion establish and increase or  decrease Reserves; provided that the Administrative Agent shall have provided the Borrower at  least five (5) Business Days&#8217; prior written notice of any such establishment or change; provided,  further, that during such five (5) Business Day period the Borrower shall not request any Credit  Extension hereunder that would cause the Availability Requirements to fail to be satisfied if such  proposed Reserve were in place.  Upon delivery of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall be  available to discuss the proposed Reserve or change, and the Borrower may take such action as  may be required so that the event, condition, circumstance or new fact that is the basis for such  Reserve or change no longer exists, in a manner and to the extent reasonably satisfactory to the  Administrative Agent in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion.  In no event shall such notice and  opportunity limit the right of the Administrative Agent to establish or change such Reserve, unless  the Administrative Agent shall have determined in its Permitted Discretion that the event,  condition, other circumstance or new fact that is the basis for such new Reserve or such change no  longer exists or has otherwise been adequately addressed by the Borrower.  Any Reserve  established or modified by the Administrative Agent shall have a reasonable relationship to  circumstances, conditions, events or contingencies which are the basis for such Reserve, as     88  reasonably determined, without duplication, by the Administrative Agent in its Permitted  Discretion.  2.18 Benchmark Replacement Setting  (a) Benchmark Replacement  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other  Credit Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark  Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of any Benchmark, then (x) if a  Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of  &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221; for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark  Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Credit  Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings  without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this  Agreement or any other Credit Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is  determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of &#8220;Benchmark Replacement&#8221;  for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such  Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Credit Document in respect of any  Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business  Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders  without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this  Agreement or any other Credit Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not  received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from  Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.  If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple  SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.  (ii) No Hedging Agreement shall constitute a &#8220;Credit Document&#8221; for  purposes of this Section 2.18.  (b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.  In connection with the use,  administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative  Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing  such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other  party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document.  (c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations.  The Administrative  Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any  Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with  the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement.  The  Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower of (x) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of  a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.18(d) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark  Unavailability Period.  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the  Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section  2.18, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence  or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking  </FONT></DIV>

(d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark.  Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, at any time (including in connection with the  implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if any then-current Benchmark is a term rate  (including Term SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen  or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the  Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the  administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information  announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the  Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous  definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non- representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is  subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a  Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not  or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the  Administrative Agent may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous  definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed  tenor.  (e) Benchmark Unavailability Period.

Each L/C Issuer party hereto  that is an issuer of Closing Date Existing Letters of Credit agrees to the foregoing  arrangements with respect to the Closing Date Existing Letters of Credit issued by it,  notwithstanding that such provisions may cause the Outstanding Amount of the L/C  Obligations of such L/C Issuer to exceed its applicable L/C Sublimit; provided that, in such  event, such L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to issue or renew any new Letters of Credit  until the applicable conditions precedent in Section 3.1(a) have been satisfied.  (ii) An L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit if:  (A) subject to Section 3.1(b)(iii), the expiry date of such  requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance  or last renewal, unless otherwise agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the  Administrative Agent in their sole discretion;     94  (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would  occur after the applicable Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless (1) each Appropriate  Lender shall have approved such expiry date or (2) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C  Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of Credit has been L/C Cash Collateralized  or otherwise backstopped in a manner that is mutually agreeable between the Borrower and  the applicable L/C Issuer; or  (C) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit is either resident in  Ireland or, where such beneficiary is a legal person, its place of establishment to which the  Letter of Credit relates is Ireland unless the L/C Issuer is either (x) authorized under the  laws of Ireland to issue Letters of Credit to any such beneficiary or (y) exempted from the  requirement to have any such authorization under the laws of Ireland.  (iii) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of  Credit if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental  Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from  issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Applicable Law or any directive (whether or not  having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C  Issuer shall prohibit, or direct that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of  credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer  with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for  which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing  Date, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which  was not applicable on the Closing Date (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise  compensated hereunder);  (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or  more policies or procedures of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally; or  (C) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other  than Dollars.  (iv) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of  Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of  Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of  Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.  (v) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Appropriate Lenders with  respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and  each L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the  Administrative Agent in Section 12 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by  the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by  it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term  &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221; as used in Section 12 included the L/C Issuer with respect to such  acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.     95  (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;  Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.  (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may  be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the  Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately  completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower.  Such Letter of Credit  Application must be received by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not  later than 12:00 noon (New York, New York time) at least three Business Days prior to the  proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be; or, in each case, such  later date and time as the relevant L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole  discretion.  In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter  of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant  L/C Issuer: (a) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be  a Business Day); (b) the amount thereof; (c) the expiry date thereof; (d) the name and  address of the beneficiary thereof, and the name of the Borrower for whose account the  Letter of Credit is to be issued; (e) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in  case of any drawing thereunder; (f) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such  beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (g) [reserved]; (h) [reserved] and (i) such  other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request.  In the case of a request  for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application  shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer (1) the  Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall  be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters  as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably request.  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the  relevant L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)  that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application  from the Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with  a copy thereof.  Unless the relevant L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender,  the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party, at least one Business Day prior to the  requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or  more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject  to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a  Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into  the applicable amendment, as the case may be.  Immediately upon the issuance of each  Letter of Credit, each Appropriate Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and  unconditionally agrees to, acquire from the relevant L/C Issuer a risk participation in such  Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share times  the amount of such Letter of Credit.  (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit  Application, the relevant L/C Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic  renewal provisions (the maturity of which shall in no event extend beyond the Letter of  Credit Expiration Date, unless such Letter of Credit has been L/C Cash Collateralized or  otherwise backstopped in a manner that is mutually agreeable between the Borrower and     96  the applicable L/C Issuer) (each, an &#8220;Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit&#8221;); provided that any  such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L/C Issuer to prevent any  such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of  issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later  than a day (each, a &#8220;Nonrenewal Notice Date&#8221;) in each such twelve-month period to be  agreed upon by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Borrower at the time such Letter of Credit  is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be  required to make a specific request to the relevant L/C Issuer for any such renewal.  Once  an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Appropriate Lenders shall be  deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the relevant L/C Issuer to permit the  renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time until an expiry date not later than the applicable  Letter of Credit Expiration Date unless such Letter of Credit has been L/C Cash  Collateralized or otherwise backstopped in a manner that is mutually agreeable between  the Borrower and the applicable L/C Issuer; provided that the relevant L/C Issuer shall not  permit any such renewal if (A) the relevant L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be  permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its  renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of  Section 3.1(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or  in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the applicable  Nonrenewal Notice Date from the Administrative Agent or any Appropriate Lender, or the  Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7 is not then  satisfied.  (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment  to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof,  the relevant L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a  non-negotiable copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.  (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.  (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any  notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall examine  drawing documents within the period stipulated by the terms and conditions of the Letter  of Credit.  After such examination, such L/C Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and  the Administrative Agent thereof.  In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an  Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer in such  Alternative Currency, unless (A) the relevant L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified  in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any  such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Borrower shall have notified the  relevant L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower  will reimburse such L/C Issuer in Dollars.  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars  of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the relevant  L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower of the Dollar Amount of the amount of the drawing  promptly following the determination thereof.  Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the first  Business Day following the date of any payment by any L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit  to be reimbursed in Dollars (including all Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars), or the  Applicable Time on the first Business Day following the date of any payment by any L/C  </FONT></DIV>

If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, the  Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the Honor Date,  the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars or in the Dollar Amount  thereof in the case of an Alternative Currency) (the &#8220;Unreimbursed Amount&#8221;), and the  amount of such Appropriate Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share thereof.  In such event, the Borrower  shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of ABR Loans in Dollars  to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount (or, in  the case of an Unreimbursed Amount denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the  Dollar Amount thereof), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section  2.2 for the principal amount of ABR Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized  portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Appropriate Lenders, and subject to  the conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than the delivery of a Notice of Borrowing).   Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section  3.1(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the  lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect  of such notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, all Revolving Credit Borrowings pursuant to  this Section 3.1(c)(i) shall be in Dollars.  (ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender (including any such Revolving  Credit Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i)  make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer  at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office for payments in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share  of the Dollar Amount of any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit, in each  case, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the  Administrative Agent (which may be the same Business Day such notice is provided if  such notice is provided prior to 12:00 noon), whereupon, subject to the provisions of  Section 3.1(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made  a Revolving Credit Loan that is an ABR Loan to the Borrower in such amount.  The  Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the relevant L/C Issuer.  (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of  Credit that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing because the conditions  set forth in Section 7 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be  deemed to have incurred from the relevant L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the Dollar  Amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall  be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default  Rate.  In such event, each Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account  of the relevant L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect  of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such  Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 3.1.  For the  avoidance of doubt, all L/C Borrowings pursuant to this Section 3.1(c)(iii) shall be in  Dollars.     98  (iv) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or  L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for any  amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata  Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer.  (v) Each Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C  Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under the applicable Letters of  Credit, as contemplated by this Section 3.1(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall  not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,  defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L/C Issuer, the  Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance  of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any  of the foregoing; provided that each Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans  pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than  delivery by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing).  No such making of an L/C Advance  shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant  L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of  Credit, together with interest as provided herein.  (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent  for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender  pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(c) by the time specified in Section  3.1(c)(ii), such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the  Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from  the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately  available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate  from time to time in effect plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily  charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  A certificate of the relevant  L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any  amounts owing under this Section 3.1(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) Repayment of Participations.  (i) If, at any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any  Letter of Credit and has received from any Appropriate Lender such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance  in respect of such payment in accordance with this Section 3.1(d), the Administrative Agent  receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related  Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or  otherwise, including proceeds of L/C Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative  Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata  Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period  of time during which such Lender&#8217;s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as  those received by the Administrative Agent.  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account  of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the  circumstances described in Section 13.19 (including pursuant to any settlement entered     99  into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the  Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on  demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand  to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the  applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under  this clause (d)(ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination  of this Agreement.  (e) Obligations Absolute.  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the  relevant L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each  L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this  Agreement, or any other Credit Document;  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other  right that Holdings or any Credit Party may have at any time against any beneficiary or any  transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any  such transferee may be acting), the relevant L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in  connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of  Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;  (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under  such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect  or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in  the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under  such Letter of Credit;  (iv) any payment by the relevant L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit  against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of  such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the relevant L/C Issuer under such Letter  of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,  assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or  successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising  in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;  (v) [reserved];  (vi) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Collateral, or any  release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guarantees or any  other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of any Credit Party in respect of such  Letter of Credit; or  (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not  similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise  constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Credit Party;     100  provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the  extent of any direct damages (as opposed to punitive or consequential damages or lost profits,  claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by Applicable Law)  suffered by the Borrower that are caused by acts or omissions of such L/C Issuer constituting gross  negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such L/C Issuer.  (f) Role of L/C Issuers.  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying  any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to  obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by  the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document  or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the L/C Issuers  nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer shall be liable  to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the  approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in  the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) a problem with the due execution,  effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of  Credit or Issuer Document.  The Borrower hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any  beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this  assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower pursuing such rights and  remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.   None of the L/C Issuers nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any  L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (iii)  of this Section 3.1(f); provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the  Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the  Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to lost profits or punitive  or consequential damages suffered by the Borrower that were caused by such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful  misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay  under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and  certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance  and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their  face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or  information to the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency  of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or  the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be  invalid or ineffective for any reason.  (g) L/C Cash Collateral.  If (i) any Event of Default occurs and is continuing  and the Required Lenders require the Borrower to L/C Cash Collateralize their respective L/C  Obligations pursuant to 10.14 or (ii) an Event of Default set forth under Section 11.5 occurs and  is continuing or (iii) for any reason, any Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time of termination  of the Revolving Credit Commitments and a backstop letter of credit that is satisfactory to the L/C  Issuer in its sole discretion is not in place, then the Borrower shall L/C Cash Collateralize the then  Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount  determined as of the date of such Event of Default or such termination date), and shall do so not  later than 2:00 p.m. on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i) or (iii), (1) the  Business Day that the Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior  to 12:00 noon or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following  </FONT></DIV>

The  Borrower hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuers and the  Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all  proceeds of the foregoing.  L/C Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked accounts at the  Administrative Agent and may be invested in Cash Equivalents made available by the  Administrative Agent and elected by the Borrower.  Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for  which funds are on deposit as L/C Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent  permitted under Applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer.  To the extent the amount  of any L/C Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L/C Obligations and so  long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the  Borrower.  In the case of clause (i) or (ii) above, if such Event of Default is cured or waived and  no other Event of Default is then occurring and continuing, the amount of any L/C Cash Collateral  shall be refunded to the Borrower.

(i) Letter of Credit Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent  for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a letter of credit fee (the  &#8220;Letter of Credit Fee&#8221;) for each Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower or its  Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily maximum  Dollar Amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such  maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum Dollar Amount  increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit).  Such Letter of Credit Fees  shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and  payable in Dollars on the first Business Day of each April, July, October and January, commencing  with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit  Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during  any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied  by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate  was in effect.  (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C  Issuers.  The Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with  respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it for the account of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries  equal to 0.125% per annum of the daily maximum Dollar Amount then available to be drawn under  such Letter of Credit.  Such fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such  fronting fees shall be due and payable on the first Business Day of each April, July, October and  January, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit,  on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.

Such customary fees and standard costs  and charges are due and payable within ten (10) Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable.  (k) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application.  Notwithstanding anything else  to the contrary in any Letter of Credit Application, in the event of any conflict between the terms  hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control.  (l) Addition of an L/C Issuer.  (i) A Lender may become an additional L/C Issuer hereunder pursuant  to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.   The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such additional L/C Issuer.  (ii) On the last Business Day of each March, June, September and  December (and on such other dates as the Administrative Agent may request), each L/C  Issuer shall provide the Administrative Agent a list of all Letters of Credit issued by it that  are outstanding at such time together with such other information as the Administrative  Agent may from time to time reasonably request.  (m) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding that a Letter of  Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of,  a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for  any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the  issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower inures to the  benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower&#8217;s business derives substantial benefits from the  businesses of such Subsidiaries.  (n) Replacement of an L/C Issuer.  Any L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time  by written agreement between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer  and the successor L/C Issuer.

At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the  Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer pursuant to  Section 3.1(i).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor L/C  Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect  to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;L/C Issuer&#8221;  shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous L/C Issuer, or such successor and all  previous L/C Issuers, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an L/C Issuer  hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the  rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit  issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit  or to extend, reinstate, or otherwise amend any then existing Letter of Credit.  3.2 Swing Line Loans  (a) The Swing Line.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the  Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans in Dollars (each such loan, a &#8220;Swing Line Loan&#8221;) to the  Borrower in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of  the Swing Line Sublimit, in each case from time to time on any Business Day during the period     103  from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date, notwithstanding the fact that (i) such Swing Line  Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit  Loans and L/C Obligations of any Lender acting as the Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount  of such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that (i) after giving effect to any Swing  Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed such  Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect and (ii) after giving effect to each Swing  Line Loan and to the application of the proceeds thereof, the Availability Requirements shall be  met.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the  Borrower may borrow under this Section 3.2, prepay under Section 2.5, and re-borrow under this  Section 3.2.  Each Swing Line Loan made to the Borrower shall be an ABR Loan.  Immediately  upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and  hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk  participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit  Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.   (b) Borrowing Procedures.  Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon  the Borrower&#8217;s irrevocable written notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent.   Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not  later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the  amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum amount of $100,000 (and any amount in excess  of $100,000 shall be an integral multiple amount of $25,000), (ii) [reserved] and (iii) the requested  borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day.  Each such notice must be made by delivery to the  Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice,  appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower.  Promptly after  receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will  confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent  has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the  Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.  Unless the Swing Line  Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including  at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of the proposed Swing  Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result  of the limitations set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 3.2(a), or (B) that one or  more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 7 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the  terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York time)  on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of the Swing  Line Loan available to the Borrower.  (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.  (i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute  discretion may request the Borrower (and the Borrower hereby agrees to submit a Notice  of Borrowing requesting) that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Revolving Credit  Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of the amount  of the Swing Line Loans then outstanding to the Borrower, which Revolving Credit Loan  shall be an ABR Loan.  Such request shall be made in a Notice of Borrowing and in  accordance with the requirements of Section 2.3, without regard to the minimum and  multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, but subject     104  to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth  in Section 7.  The Borrower shall furnish the Swing Line Lender with a copy of each  applicable Notice of Borrowing promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative  Agent.  Each Appropriate Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the  amount specified in each such Notice of Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent  in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s  Office not later than the time specified in Section 2.3(b) on the date specified in such Notice  of Borrowing, whereupon, subject to Section 3.2(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds  available shall be deemed to have made Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower in such  respective amounts.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the  Swing Line Lender.  (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such  a Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 3.2(c)(i), the request for Loans  submitted by the Borrower as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing  Line Lender that each of the Appropriate Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant  Swing Line Loan and each Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account  of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 3.2(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect  of such participation.  (iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent  for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender  pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2(c) by the time specified in Section  3.2(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting  through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the  period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is  immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable  Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar  fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If  such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid  shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Borrowing  or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate  of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent)  with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent  manifest error.  (iv) Each Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to  purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 3.2(c)  shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,  including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such  Lender may have against any Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for  any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other  occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided  that each Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section  3.2(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than delivery by the Borrower  of a Notice of Borrowing).  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise  </FONT></DIV>

(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of  principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line  Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 13.19 (including pursuant to  any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender with  a participation in such Swing Line Loan shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata  Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date  of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the  applicable Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the  request of the Swing Line Lender.  The obligations of the applicable Lenders under this  clause (d)(ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this  Agreement.  (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender.  The Swing Line Lender shall  be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the applicable Swing Line Loans.  Until  each applicable Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or risk participation pursuant to this  Section 3.2 to refinance such Lender&#8217;s Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect  of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

The  commitment fees shall accrue at all times from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date, including     106  at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Section 7 is not met, and shall be due  and payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each April, July, October and January,  commencing with April, 2023, and on the Maturity Date.  (b) [Reserved].  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay directly to the Administrative Agent for its own  account the administrative agent fees as set forth in the Fee Letter.  4.2 Termination or Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments, L/C Sublimit  or Swing Line Sublimit  (a) Optional.

Each such notice shall specify the  date and amount of such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due  and payable on the date specified therein.  5.2 Mandatory Prepayments  (a) If at any time any of the Availability Requirements fail to be satisfied  (except as the result of the making of a Protective Advance, unless requested by the Administrative  Agent), then, the Borrower shall promptly prepay Loans and L/C Cash Collateralize L/C  Obligations (it being understood that any such L/C Obligations so L/C Cash Collateralized will     108  not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of this Section 5.2(a)) so that the Availability  Requirements will be satisfied.  (b) At all times following the establishment of the Cash Management Systems  pursuant to Section 9.16 and during the Cash Dominion Period (subject to the provisions of the  Security Documents), on each Business Day, at or before 1:00 p.m. (local time), the Administrative  Agent shall apply all immediately available funds credited to any Concentration Account of any  Credit Party, first to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent,  the Collateral Agent, each L/C Issuer, and the Revolving Credit Lenders hereunder, in each case  in their capacity as such, pro rata, second to pay interest due and payable in respect of any Loans  (including Swing Line Loans and Protective Advances) of the Borrower that may be outstanding,  pro rata, third to prepay the principal of any Protective Advances to the Borrower that may be  outstanding, pro rata and fourth to prepay the principal of the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing  Line Loans to the Borrower and to L/C Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations of the Borrower, pro  rata.  5.3 Method and Place of Payment  (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition  or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly  provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative  Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable  Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office for payment and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the  date specified herein.  If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Applicable Law from  making any required payment hereunder in any Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make  such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of the applicable foreign currency payment amount.   The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other  applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to  such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m.  (New York, New York time) shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding  Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  (b) Unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date  any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of  any Lender or an L/C Issuer hereunder, that the Borrower will not make such payment, the  Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has timely made such payment and may (but  shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to such  Lender or L/C Issuer.  If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the  Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then such Lender or L/C Issuer shall forthwith on  demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made  available to such Lender or L/C Issuer in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect  of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative  Agent to such Lender or L/C Issuer to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent  in Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  (c) A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with  respect to any amount owing under this Section 5.3 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">   109  5.4 Net Payments  (a) Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any  Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of,  and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes; provided that if the  Borrower or any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent shall be required by Applicable Law (as  determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) to deduct or withhold  any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the Administrative  Agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and (ii) the Borrower or such Guarantor or the  Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant  Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in accordance with Applicable Law.  If such  a Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the Borrower or any Guarantor shall be increased  as necessary so that after making all such required deductions and withholdings (including such  deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.4), the  Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount  equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.   Whenever any Indemnified Taxes are payable by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as promptly as  practicable thereafter, the Borrower or the Guarantor shall send to the Administrative Agent for its  own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original  official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to such Lender, acting reasonably) received by the  Borrower or such Guarantor showing payment thereof.  (b) The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority  Other Taxes in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent,  timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes that are paid by the Administrative Agent  to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent,  the Collateral Agent and each Lender within fifteen Business Days after written demand therefor,  for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent, the Collateral  Agent or such Lender as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of  any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Credit Document  (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this  Section 5.4) payable or paid by such Agent or Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from  a payment to such Agent or Lender and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom  or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed  or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate setting forth reasonable detail  as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy  to the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (as applicable) on  its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10  days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to  the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such  Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes  attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.6 relating to the  maintenance of a Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case,     110  that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any  Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereof, whether  or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental  Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by  the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby  authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to  such Lender under this Agreement or any Credit Document or otherwise payable by the  Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the  Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).  (e) Any Non-U.S. Lender claiming a basis for an exemption from or reduction  of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax  purposes, or under any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments  hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall, to the extent it is legally able to do so, deliver  to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by  Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such  properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such  payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding or as will permit the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be  made.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall  deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the  Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to  determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting  requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4(d), the completion,  execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in  Section 5.4(f), 5.4(i) and 5.4(j) below) shall not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment  such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material  unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of  such Lender.  (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(e), each Non-U.S. Lender  with respect to any amounts payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall, to the  extent it is legally entitled to do so:  (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or  prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement  (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent), two executed copies of (x) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender  claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding Tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of  the Code with respect to payments of &#8220;portfolio interest&#8221;, United States Internal Revenue  Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (together with a certificate substantially in the form  of Exhibit J-1 representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank within the meaning of  Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of  Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower, any interest payment received by such  Non-U.S. Lender under this Agreement or any other Credit Document is not effectively  connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and is not a controlled  foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of     111  the Code)), (y) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8-BEN-E or Form W- 8ECI, in each case properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender  claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax on  payments under any Credit Document or (z) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the  beneficial owner with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender  under any of the Credit Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation or  where Non-U.S. Lender is a pass through entity) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY  and all necessary attachments (including the forms described in clauses (x) and (y) above  and in Section 5.4(i), Exhibit J-2, Exhibit J-3 and or other certification documents from  each beneficial owner, as applicable); provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership  it may provide Exhibit J-4 on behalf of one or more of its direct or indirect partners that  are claiming the portfolio interest exemption; and  (ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two  further copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or  before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate  in any respect and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent  form previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  If in any such case any Change in Law has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery  would otherwise be required that renders any such form inapplicable or would prevent such Non- U.S. Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it, such Non-U.S.  Lender shall promptly so advise the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  (g) If any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as  applicable, determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it had received and  retained a refund of an Indemnified Tax or additional sums payable under this Section 5.4  (including an Other Tax) for which a payment has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this  Agreement, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender, the Administrative Agent or  the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower,  then the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall  reimburse the Borrower for such amount (net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender, the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other than  any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such  refund) as the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be,  determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be the proportion of the refund as will  leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position (taking into account expenses or  any Taxes imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the payment had not been required;  provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the  Collateral Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest  or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender, the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in the event the Lender, the Administrative Agent or  the Collateral Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  A Lender,  the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall claim any refund that it determines is  available to it, unless it concludes in its sole discretion that it would be adversely affected by  making such a claim.  None of any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall     112  be obliged to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs that it deems confidential to any  Credit Party in connection with this clause (g).  (h) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists for contesting a  Tax, each Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the  Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in challenging such Tax.  Subject to the  provisions of Section 2.12, each Lender and Agent agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate  with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request to minimize any amount payable by  the Borrower or any Guarantor pursuant to this Section 5.4.  The Borrower shall indemnify and  hold each Lender and Agent harmless against any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Person  in connection with any request made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.4(h).  Nothing in  this Section 5.4(h) shall obligate any Lender or Agent to take any action that such Person, in its  sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to such Person.  (i) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(d), with respect to any  amounts payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document, each Lender or Agent that is a  United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (each, a &#8220;U.S. Lender&#8221;) shall deliver  to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two United States Internal Revenue Service Forms  W-9 (or substitute or successor form), properly completed and duly executed, certifying that such  Lender or Agent is exempt from United States backup withholding (i) on or prior to the Closing  Date (or on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that  such form expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) after the occurrence of a  change in such Agent&#8217;s or Lender&#8217;s circumstances requiring a change in the most recent form  previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and (iv) from time to time  thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  (j) If a payment made to any Agent or Lender would be subject to U.S. federal  withholding Tax imposed under FATCA if such Agent or Lender were to fail to comply with the  applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or  1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Agent or Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably  requested by the Borrower or such Agent, such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law  (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such other documentation  reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as may be necessary for the  Administrative Agent and the Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to  determine whether such Agent or Lender has or has not complied with such Agent&#8217;s or Lender&#8217;s  FATCA obligations and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such  payment and deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such  documentation on or before the date that any such documentation expires or becomes obsolete or  inaccurate in any respect and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the  documentation previously delivered by it to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  Solely for  purposes of this subsection (j), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to FATCA after  the date of this Agreement and any current or future intergovernmental agreements and any  Applicable Law implementing such agreement entered into in connection therewith.

All other computations of fees and interest shall  be made on the basis of a 360 day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or  interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall  accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or  any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan  that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 5.3(a), bear interest for  one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall  be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  5.6 Limit on Rate of Interest  (a) No Payment Shall Exceed Lawful Rate.  Notwithstanding any other term of  this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any interest or other amounts under or  in connection with this Agreement or otherwise in respect of the Obligations in excess of the  amount or rate permitted under or consistent with any Applicable Law.  (b) Payment at Highest Lawful Rate.  If the Borrower is not obliged to make a  payment that it would otherwise be required to make, as a result of Section 5.6(a), the Borrower  shall make such payment to the maximum extent permitted by or consistent with Applicable Laws.  (c) Adjustment if Any Payment Exceeds Lawful Rate.  If any provision of this  Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents would obligate the Borrower to make any  payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate that  would be prohibited by any Applicable Law, then notwithstanding such provision, such amount or  rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate  of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by Applicable Law, such adjustment  to be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be  paid by the Borrower to the affected Lender under Section 2.8.  (d) Spreading.  In determining whether the interest hereunder is in excess of the  amount or rate permitted under or consistent with any Applicable Law, the total amount of interest  shall be spread throughout the entire term of this Agreement until its Payment in Full.  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments  contemplated thereby, if any Lender shall have received from the Borrower an amount in excess  of the maximum permitted by any Applicable Law, then the Borrower shall be entitled, by notice  in writing to the Administrative Agent to obtain reimbursement from that Lender in an amount  equal to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an  amount payable by that Lender to the Borrower.     114  SECTION 6 Conditions Precedent to the Closing Date  The obligation of each Lender and each L/C Issuer to make a Credit Extension  hereunder on the Closing Date is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth below.  6.1 Credit Documents  (a) The Administrative Agent shall have received, in each case, as reasonably  satisfactory in form and substance to the Lenders party hereto as of the Closing Date, (i) this  Agreement, executed and delivered by an Authorized Officer of Holdings and the Borrower, (ii)  the Guarantee, executed and delivered by an Authorized Officer of each Guarantor as of the  Closing Date, (iii) the Security Agreement, executed and delivered by an Authorized Officer of  each grantor party thereto as of the Closing Date and (iv) the ABL Intercreditor Agreement,  executed and delivered by the DIP Term Loan Agent and an Authorized Officer of each Credit  Party as of the Closing Date.

(each, a &#8220;Concentration Account&#8221;) all available cash receipts, from:  (i) the sale of Inventory and other Collateral (other than identifiable  proceeds of Term Priority Collateral);  (ii) all proceeds of collections of Accounts; and  (iii) each Blocked Account (including all cash deposited therein from  each DDA).  If, at any time during the Cash Dominion Period, any cash or Cash Equivalents  owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor (other than amounts held in Excluded  Accounts and, solely in respect of Excluded Accounts identified in clause (ii) of the definition  thereof, required by Applicable Law) are deposited to any account, or held or invested in any  manner, other than in a Blocked Account (other than a Blocked Account that is a cash pooling  account) that is subject to a Blocked Account Agreement (or a DDA which is swept daily to a  Blocked Account (other than a Blocked Account that is a cash pooling account)), the  Administrative Agent may require the applicable Person to close such account and have all funds  therein transferred to a Blocked Account (other than a cash pooling account), and all future  deposits made to a Blocked Account (other than a Blocked Account that is a cash pooling account)  which is subject to a Blocked Account Agreement; provided that, to the extent that cash or Cash  Equivalents are deposited in any Blocked Account that is a cash pooling account during a Cash  Dominion Period, the Borrower shall transfer such cash and Cash Equivalents to a Blocked  Account that is not a cash pooling account, but, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing, the Administrative Agent may not require that (i) any such cash pooling account be  closed or (ii) any cash and Cash Equivalents on deposit in any such cash pooling account prior to  the commencement of a Cash Dominion Period be transferred to a Blocked Account that is not a  cash pooling account.  In addition to the foregoing, during the Cash Dominion Period, at the  request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with an  accounting of the contents of the Blocked Accounts, which shall identify, to the reasonable  satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, the proceeds from the Collateral which were deposited  into a Blocked Account and swept to a Concentration Account.  </FONT></DIV>

Each such Person shall  furnish the Administrative Agent with prior written notice of its intention to open or close a  Blocked Account and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower as to whether  the Administrative Agent shall require a Blocked Account Agreement with the Person with whom  such account will be maintained.

In the case of  any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any liabilities, obligations, losses,  damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind  whatsoever that may at any time occur, be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Revolving  Credit Commitments, the Loans and Letters of Credit, this Agreement, any of the other Credit  Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in  connection with any of the foregoing (including at any time following the payment of the Loans),  this Section 12.7 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any  Lender or any other Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse such  Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including  attorneys&#8217; fees) incurred by such Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,  administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal  proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice rendered in respect of rights or responsibilities under,  this Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to  herein, to the extent that such Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the  Borrower; provided that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrower&#8217;s  continuing reimbursement obligations with respect thereto.  If any indemnity furnished to any  Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired,  such Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts  indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished; provided that in no event shall  this sentence require any Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss,  damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in excess of such Lender&#8217;s  pro rata portion thereof; and provided, further, this sentence shall not be deemed to require any  Lender to indemnify any Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action,  judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement resulting from such Agent&#8217;s gross negligence or  willful misconduct (as determined by a final judgment of court of competent jurisdiction).  The  agreements in this Section 12.7 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts  payable hereunder.  12.8 Agents in their Individual Capacities  Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and  generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrower, any other Guarantor, and  any other Credit Party as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder and under the other     170  Credit Documents.

Upon receipt of any  such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, subject to the consent of the  Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) so long as no Event of Default under  Section 11.1 or 11.5 (solely with respect to the Borrower) has occurred and is continuing, to  appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of  any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so  appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after  the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the  Lenders and the L/C Issuers, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above  (including receipt of the Borrower&#8217;s consent); provided that if such Agent shall notify the  Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person (including as a result of the absence of consent  of the Borrower) has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become  effective in accordance with such notice and (x) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its  duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (except that in the case of  any collateral security held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties under any of  the Credit Documents, the retiring Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security  until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed) and (y) all payments, communications  and determinations provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be made by or  to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders with (except  after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default under Section 11.1 or 11.5  (solely with respect to the Borrower)) the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably  withheld) appoint successor Agents as provided for above in this paragraph.

If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or other  jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from  amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered,  was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent or of  a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax  ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the  extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower (solely to  the extent required by this Agreement) and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do  so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or  otherwise, including penalties and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including legal  expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses.  12.11 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim  In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, administration,  bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding  relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any  Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and  irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)  shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest  owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and  to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the  Secured Parties (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements  and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel  and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereunder) allowed in such  judicial proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable  on any such claims and to distribute the same;  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other  similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Secured Party to make  such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall  consent to the making of such payments directly to the Secured Parties, to pay to the  Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements  and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due  the Administrative Agent under Sections 4.1 and 13.5.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to  authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Secured     172  Party or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Secured Party  in any such proceeding.  12.12 ABL Intercreditor Agreement  Each of the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to  enter into the ABL Intercreditor Agreement contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto  acknowledge that the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to which the Collateral Agent and/or the  Administrative Agent is a party are each binding upon them.

Further, each Register shall contain  the name and address of the Administrative Agent and the Lending Office through which  each such Person acts under this Agreement.  The entries in the Register shall be  conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the  Collateral Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the  Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this  Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for  inspection by Holdings, the Borrower, the Collateral Agent, the L/C Issuers and any Lender  (solely with respect to its own outstanding Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments), at  any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption  executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee&#8217;s completed Administrative  Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing  and recordation fee referred to in clause (b) of this Section 13.6 (unless waived) and any  written consent to such assignment required by clause (b) of this Section 13.6, the  Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption and record  the information contained therein in the Register.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall  have no obligation with respect to, and shall bear no responsibility or liability for, the monitoring  or enforcing of the list of Disqualified Institutions with respect to the sales of participations at any  time.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall  provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any  amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit  Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,  without the consent of the Participant, agree to any consent, amendment, modification, supplement  or waiver described in clause (i) or (iv) of the second proviso of the first paragraph of Section 13.1  that directly and adversely affects such Participant.  Subject to clause (c)(ii) of this Section 13.6,  the Borrower agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11 and  5.4 (and the comparable provisions of Section 14) to the same extent as if it were a Lender, and  provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the requirements and limitations of those  Sections and Sections 2.12 and 13.7(a) as though it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by  assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.6.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,  each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.8(b) as though it were a Lender;  provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.8(a) as though it were a Lender.   Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use  reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 13.7 with  respect to any Participant.  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment  under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.4 (or the comparable provisions under Section 14) than the  applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold  to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the  Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent.  (iii) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this  purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the  name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each  Participant&#8217;s interest in the Revolving Credit Loans (or other rights or obligations) held by  it (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;).  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive,  absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in  the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this  Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  No Lender shall have any     184  obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity  of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any  commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit Document)  to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such  commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section  5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of Holdings, the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its  rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or  assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 13.6 shall not apply  to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment  of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any  such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  (e) Subject to Section 13.16, the Borrower authorize each Lender to disclose  (other than to any Disqualified Institutions) to any Participant, secured creditor of such Lender or  assignee (each, a &#8220;Transferee&#8221;), any prospective Transferee and any prospective direct or indirect  contractual counterparties to any swap or derivative transactions to be entered into in connection  with or relating to Revolving Credit Loans made hereunder any and all financial information in  such Lender&#8217;s possession concerning the Borrower and their Affiliates that has been delivered to  such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and their Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or  that has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower and their Affiliates in  connection with such Lender&#8217;s credit evaluation of the Borrower and their Affiliates prior to  becoming a party to this Agreement.  (f) SPV Lender.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,  any Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an &#8220;SPV&#8221;),  identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent  and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Revolving Credit  Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make the Borrower pursuant to  this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to  make any Revolving Credit Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise  fails to provide all or any part of such Revolving Credit Loan, the Granting Lender shall be  obligated to make such Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a  Revolving Credit Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Revolving Credit Commitment of  the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Revolving Credit Loan were made by such  Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity  or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the  Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which  agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year  and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior  indebtedness of any SPV, it shall not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting  against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation  proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.  In addition, notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Section 13.6, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without  the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any  </FONT></DIV>

This Section 13.6(f) may not be  amended without the written consent of the SPV.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, (x) no SPV shall be entitled to any greater rights under Sections 2.10, 2.11, and 5.4  (and the comparable provisions under Section 14) than its Granting Lender would have been  entitled to absent the use of such SPV and (y) each SPV agrees to be subject to the requirements  of Sections 2.10, 2.11, and 5.4 (and the comparable provisions under Section 14) as though it were  a Lender and has acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 13.6.

(b) If any Lender (such Lender, a &#8220;Non-Consenting Lender&#8221;) has failed to  consent to a proposed amendment, modification, supplement, waiver, discharge or termination that  pursuant to the terms of Section 13.1 requires the consent of either (i) all of the Lenders directly  and adversely affected or (ii) all of the Lenders, and, in each case, with respect to which the     186  Required Lenders or a majority (in principal amount) of the directly and adversely affected Lenders  shall, in each such case, have granted their consent, then so long as no Event of Default then exists,  the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) to (x)  replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to assign its  Revolving Credit Loans and its Revolving Credit Commitments hereunder to one or more  assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (to the extent such consent would be  required under Section 13.6) or (y) terminate the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender,  repay all Obligations of the Borrower due and owing to such Lender relating to the Revolving  Credit Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date; provided that: (a)  all Obligations of the Borrower hereunder owing to such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced  shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, and (b)  the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a  price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  In connection  with any such assignment, the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and  the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 13.6.  (c) Nothing in this Section 13.7 shall be deemed to prejudice any right or  remedy that Holdings or the Borrower may otherwise have at law or at equity.  13.8 Adjustments; Set-off  (a) Except as contemplated in Section 13.6 or elsewhere herein or in any other  Credit Document, if any Lender (a &#8220;Benefited Lender&#8221;) shall in its capacity as a Revolving Credit  Lender, at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Revolving Credit Loans, or interest  thereon, or the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it, or receive any  collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or  proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.5, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than its  Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share contemplated hereunder) compared to any such payment  to or collateral received by any other Revolving Credit Lender, if any, in respect of such other  Revolving Credit Lender&#8217;s Revolving Credit Loans, or interest thereon or the participations in the  L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans, in each case, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for  cash from the other applicable Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other  Lender&#8217;s applicable Revolving Credit Loans, applicable participations in L/C Obligations and  Swing Line Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or  the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess  payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the applicable Lenders;  provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter  recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price  and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in  addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Applicable Law, each Lender shall  have the right, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether  at the Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against  such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) (other  than any Excluded Account of the type described in clause (i), (ii), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of the  definition thereof), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency,     187  in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time  held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account  of the Borrower.

The obligation of the Borrower in respect  of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the  other Credit Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#8220;Judgment  Currency&#8221;) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable  provisions of this Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement Currency&#8221;), be discharged only to the extent that     194  on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so  due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking  procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the  Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent  from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and  notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom  such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so  purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the  Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other  Person who may be entitled thereto under Applicable Law).  13.21 Cashless Rollovers  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any  other Credit Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or replaces,  renews or refinances, any of its then-existing Revolving Credit Loans by way of any other  amendment to this Agreement, in each case, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or  refinancing is effected by means of a &#8220;cashless roll&#8221; by such Lender, such extension, replacement,  renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any requirement hereunder or any other  Credit Document that such payment be made &#8220;in Dollars&#8221;, &#8220;in immediately available funds&#8221;, &#8220;in  Same Day Funds&#8221;, &#8220;in cash&#8221; or any other similar requirement.  13.22 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Credit Document or in any other  agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges  that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Credit Document, to the  extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the  applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be  bound by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the  applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to  it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and  (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if  applicable:  (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other  instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or  a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares  or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect  to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Credit Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the  exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.     195  13.23 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs  To the extent that the Credit Documents provide support, through a guarantee or  otherwise, for Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such  support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221; and each such QFC a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties  acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated  thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC  Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Credit Documents  and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York  and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):  (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a  &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the  transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and  obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in  property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will  be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution  Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and  rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a  proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Credit Documents  that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be  exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such  Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC  and the Credit Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United  States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of  the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered  Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

(b) Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender or any  Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender (and each of their respective successors and  assigns) agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a  payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the  Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a  different date from, that specified in this Agreement or in a notice of payment, prepayment or  repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment,  prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment,  prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that  such Lender, or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in  error or by mistake (in whole or in part), then in each such case:  (i) it acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the case of immediately  preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error and mistake shall be presumed to have been made  (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error  and mistake has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case,  with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and  (ii) such Lender shall (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to  cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in  all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of the occurrence of any of the  circumstances described in immediately preceding clauses (x), (y) and (z)) notify the  Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details  thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant  to this Section 13.27(b).  For the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver a notice to the Administrative  Agent pursuant to this Section 13.27(b) shall not have any effect on a Payment Recipient&#8217;s  obligations pursuant to Section 13.27(a) or on whether or not an Erroneous Payment has  been made.     199  (c) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and  apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Credit Document, or  otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender under any Credit  Document with respect to any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, against any  amount that the Administrative Agent has demanded to be returned under immediately preceding  clause (a).  (d)   (i) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not  recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor in accordance  with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous  Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such  Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered  amount, an &#8220;Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency&#8221;), upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s  notice to such Lender at any time, then effective immediately (with the consideration  therefor being acknowledged by the parties hereto), (A) such Lender shall be deemed to  have assigned its Loans (but not its Revolving Credit Commitments) with respect to which  such Erroneous Payment was made (the &#8220;Erroneous Payment Impacted Class&#8221;) in an  amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the  Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Revolving  Credit Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the &#8220;Erroneous  Payment Deficiency Assignment&#8221;) (on a cashless basis and such amount calculated at par  plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the  Administrative Agent in such instance)), and is hereby (together with the Borrower)  deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance (or, to the extent applicable,  an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Acceptance by reference pursuant to a  Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants) with  respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver  any notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but the  failure of such Person to deliver any such notes shall not affect the effectiveness of the  foregoing assignment), (B) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be  deemed to have acquired the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (C) upon such  deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a  Lender, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency  Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender, as applicable, hereunder  with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the  avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement  and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender, (D) the  Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall each be deemed to have waived any consents  required under this Agreement to any such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment,  and (E) the Administrative Agent will reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the  Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.  For the avoidance of  doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Revolving Credit  Commitments of any Lender and such Revolving Credit Commitments shall remain  available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.       200  (ii) Subject to Section 13.6 (but excluding, in all events, any assignment  consent or approval requirements (other than the requirement to obtain the Borrower&#8217;s  consent, if any)), the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired  pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds  of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender  shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loans (or portion thereof), and the  Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender  (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf).  In addition, an  Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender (x) shall be reduced  by the proceeds of prepayments or repayments of principal and interest, or other  distribution in respect of principal and interest, received by the Administrative Agent on or  with respect to any such Loans acquired from such Lender pursuant to an Erroneous  Payment Deficiency Assignment (to the extent that any such Advances are then owned by  the Administrative Agent) and (y) may, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent,  be reduced by any amount specified by the Administrative Agent in writing to the  applicable Lender from time to time.  (e) The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Administrative  Agent may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof)  is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion  thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests  of such Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on  behalf of a Lender, to the rights and interests of such Lender) under the Credit Documents with  respect to such amount (the &#8220;Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights&#8221;) (provided that the  Borrower&#8217;s obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents in respect of the  Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such obligations in respect of  Loans that have been assigned to the Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment  Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or  otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit  Document; provided that this Section 13.27 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the  due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the obligations of  any of the Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the obligations that  would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative  Agent; provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and  (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the  amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative  Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.  (f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert  any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any  claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim  or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received,  including, without limitation, any defense based on &#8220;discharge for value&#8221; or any similar doctrine.  (g) Each party&#8217;s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 13.27  shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or  obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Revolving Credit  </FONT></DIV>
