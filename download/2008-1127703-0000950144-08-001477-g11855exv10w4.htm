<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The administrator for purposes of this Agreement shall be ProAssurance (&#147;Administrator&#148;),
whose address is 100 Brookwood Place, Birmingham, Alabama 35209; Telephone: (205)&nbsp;877-4400. The
&#147;Named Fiduciary&#148; as defined in Section 402(a) (2)&nbsp;or ERISA, also shall be ProAssurance.
ProAssurance shall have the right to designate one or more employees of the Companies as the
Administrator and the Named Fiduciary at any time, and to change the address and telephone number
of the same. ProAssurance shall give the Executive written notice of any change in the
Administrator and Named Fiduciary, or in the address or telephone number of the same.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Administrator shall make all determinations as to the right of any person to receive
benefits under the Agreement. Any denial by the Administrator of a claim for benefits by the
Executive (&#147;the claimant&#148;) shall be stated in writing by the Administrator and delivered or mailed
to the claimant within ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances
require an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension is required, written
notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial
10-day period. In no event shall such extension exceed a period of ten (10)&nbsp;days from the end of
the initial period. Any notice of denial shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial,
specific reference to pertinent provisions of this Agreement upon which the denial is based, a
description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the
claim, with an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and any explanation of
claim review procedures, written to the best of the Administrator&#146;s ability in a manner that may be
understood without legal or actuarial counsel.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;A claimant whose claim for benefits has been wholly or partially denied by the
Administrator may request, within ten (10)&nbsp;days following the receipt of such denial, in a writing
addressed to the Administrator, a review of such denial. The claimant shall be entitled to submit
such issues or comments in writing or otherwise, as the claimant shall consider relevant to a
determination of the claim, and the claimant may include a request for a hearing in person before
the Administrator. Prior to submitting the request, the claimant shall be entitled to review such
documents as the Administrator shall agree are pertinent to the claim. The claimant may, at all
stages of review, be represented by counsel, legal or otherwise, of the claimant&#146;s choice. All
requests for review shall be promptly resolved. The Administrator&#146;s decision with respect to any
such review shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the claimant not later than ten
(10)&nbsp;days following receipt by the Administrator of the claimant&#146;s request unless special
circumstances, such as the need to hold a hearing, require an extension of time for processing, in
which case the Administrator&#146;s decision shall be so mailed not later than twenty (20)&nbsp;days after
receipt of such request.

arbitration shall be the sole recourse to settle any claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to a breach or the interpretation of this Agreement, except as either party may be seeking
injunctive relief. Either party may file for arbitration. A claimant seeking relief on a claim
for benefits, however, must first follow the procedure in Section&nbsp;11 hereof and may file for
arbitration within sixty (60)&nbsp;days following claimant&#146;s receipt of the Administrator&#146;s written
decision on review under Section 11(c) hereof, or if the Administrator fails to provide any written
decision under Section&nbsp;11 hereof, within 60&nbsp;days of the date on which such written decision was
required to be delivered to the claimant as therein provided. The arbitration shall be held at a
mutually agreeable location, and shall be subject to and in accordance with the arbitration rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association; provided that if the location cannot be
agreed upon the arbitration shall be held in either Birmingham, Alabama, or Chicago, Illinois,
whichever location is closer to the principal office where the Executive was employed on the Date
of Termination. The arbitrator may award any and all remedies allowable by the cause of action
subject to the arbitration, but the arbitrator&#146;s sole authority shall be to interpret and apply the
provisions of this Agreement. In reaching its decision the arbitrator shall have no authority to
change or modify any provision of this Agreement or other written agreement between the parties.
The arbitrator shall have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses at the hearing. Any
court having jurisdiction may enter a judgment based upon such arbitration. All decisions of the
arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties without appeal to any court. Upon execution
of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have waived any right to commence litigation
proceedings regarding this Agreement outside of arbitration or injunctive relief without the
express consent of ProAssurance. The Companies shall pay all arbitration fees and the arbitrator&#146;s
compensation. If the Executive prevails in the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator may require
the Companies to reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of Executive&#146;s
personal counsel for his or her professional services rendered to the Executive in connection with
the enforcement of this Agreement.

agreement between the Executive and the Companies or any of them providing for Executive&#146;s
employment for any fixed duration, nor shall it be deemed to modify or undercut the Executive&#146;s at
will employment status with the Companies.
