of or interest on the Loan and to each of the fees identified in Section 2.8(a)
through Section 2.8(d)and (iii) the date and amount of each payment made by the

by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the

Agent on the Closing Date (i) a promissory note substantially in the form of

Note, there shall first be furnished to the Borrower and the Board an instrument

                (a)     Notice. The Borrower may, upon at least fifteen (15)
days' prior revocable notice to the Board, the Loan Administrator, the KHFC
Administrative Agent and the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate
principal amount of the prepayment, elect to prepay the outstanding principal
amount of the Loan ratably as to Tranche A and Tranche B, in whole or in part
(but not less than a minimum amount of $5,000,000), together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided, however, that upon any prepayment of all or a portion of the Loan by
the Borrower, or if the Borrower revokes such notice at any time within such
fifteen (15) days, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to
Section 2.10(e) or (f).

                (b)     Amounts Due upon Notice. Upon the giving of any notice
of prepayment under Section 2.5(a), the principal amount of the Loan specified
to be prepaid together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall become due
and payable on the date specified for such prepayment; provided, however, that
any failure to make any such prepayment in full on such date shall be deemed to
be an automatic revocation of the notice of prepayment given under Section
2.5(a) and such failure shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default
hereunder; provided, further, however, that the Borrower shall be obligated to
pay on such date any amounts owing under Section 2.10(e) or (f) due to such
failure to prepay.

                (c)     Application of Optional Prepayments. Any partial
prepayment of the Loan under this Section 2.5 shall be applied to the then
remaining installments of the outstanding principal amount of the Loan ratably
as to Tranche A and Tranche B in the inverse order of maturity. Any such
prepayment shall be paid to the Agent for application as provided in Section
2.9. The Borrower shall have no right to optionally prepay the principal amount
of the Loan other than as provided in this Section 2.5, Section 2.10(b) or
Section 2.10(d).

provided below in an amount equal to the amount of all such proceeds net of any
reasonable and customary brokers' and advisors' fees, any underwriting discounts
and commissions and other costs incurred in connection with such transaction
(provided that evidence of such fees, discounts, commissions and costs is
provided to the Board and the Agent) ("Net Issue Proceeds"); provided, that, (i)
with respect to Future Issuances of Capital Stock in connection with the
exercise of any warrants, options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock that
are issued as part of the Consummation of the Plan, the Borrower shall be
obligated to prepay the Loan only to the extent that the Net Issue Proceeds from
all such Future Issuances consummated after the Closing Date exceed $10,000,000;
(ii) with respect to other Future Issuances of Capital Stock or warrants,
options or other rights to acquire Capital Stock consummated after the Closing
Date, the Borrower (A) shall not be obligated to prepay the Loan from the first
$50,000,000 of Net Issue Proceeds therefrom, and (B) thereafter, shall be
obligated to prepay the Loan in amounts equal to (1) 25% on a dollar-for-dollar
basis of Net Issue Proceeds from the next $50,000,000 of Net Issue Proceeds, (2)
50% on a dollar-for-dollar basis of Net Issue Proceeds from the next $50,000,000
of Net Issue Proceeds, (3) 75% on a dollar-for-dollar basis of Net Issue
Proceeds from the next $50,000,000 of Net Issue Proceeds, and (4) 100% of Net
Issue Proceeds in excess of $200,000,000, with all calculations of Net Issue
Proceeds for the purpose of this clause (ii) being made on a cumulative basis

not be obligated to so prepay the Loan if and to the extent that (A) the Future
Issuance is of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, (B) an Obligor applies the
proceeds of a Future Issuance of Indebtedness to make pre-delivery payments,
deposits or progress payments (or other similar payments) with respect to the

<PAGE>

Obligor for any such payment or deposit), an Obligor applies such proceeds to
purchase (or reimburse itself or any other Obligor for the purchase of) Aircraft
Related Equipment, or an Obligor otherwise sets aside such proceeds (through an

another Obligor intends to replace the assets from which such Net Cash Proceeds
derived, and does so (or enters into a definitive agreement committing to do so)
within one (1) year of receipt thereof (it being understood that any Net Cash
Proceeds retained by the Borrower but not actually expended within such year or
pursuant to such agreement to replace the assets from which such Net Cash
Proceeds derived shall be used to prepay the Loan on the expiration of such
year), (ii) with Net Cash Proceeds from any transaction described on Schedule

series of transactions that generate(s) Net Cash Proceeds of $25,000 or less,

any amount financed by Indebtedness, the prepayment of which is contemplated by
the definition of Net Cash Proceeds), plus costs and expenses incurred by the
Obligors in connection therewith, or (v) with Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset
Sales of assets that are not Collateral to the extent that the aggregate sales
price of all such Asset Sales (excluding Net Cash Proceeds of sales referred to

        such amounts shall be distributed to the Board under this clause (ii) as
        if it were a Lender (it being understood that following the Board's
        honoring of a demand for payment in accordance with the Board Guaranty

        payments thereunder, the amounts paid in respect of Tranche A shall be
        distributed to the Board and amounts paid in respect of Tranche B shall

<PAGE>

                (iii)   third, to pay on a pro rata basis (A) interest then due
        and payable in respect of the Loan to the Lenders, provided that, so
        long as the Board Guaranty is in effect, to the extent that any amounts
        received by the Agent constitute interest accrued on any overdue
        principal or interest on Tranche A in accordance with Section 2.7(c),
        such amounts shall be distributed to the Board under this clause (iii)
        as if it were a Lender and (B) in the event that any fees payable to the

        advance) (including interest accrued thereon through the date of payment
        in accordance with Section 2.8(g)), on a pro rata basis (it being

        payments thereunder, amounts paid in respect of Tranche A shall be
        distributed to the Board and amounts paid in respect of Tranche B shall
        be distributed to the Tranche B Lenders, in each case on a pro rata
        basis); and

        2.8(c) to the Board under and in accordance with Section 2.8(c)
        (including interest accrued thereon through the date of payment in
        accordance with Section 2.8(g)) and not otherwise paid pursuant to
        clause (iii) above.

                (f)     Assignment to Board of Lender's Interest in Loan. Upon
the assignment to the Board of any Tranche A Lender's right, title and interest
in and to its pro rata portion of the principal of and interest on Tranche A in
accordance with the Board Guaranty, the Board shall have the rights and
privileges of a Tranche A Lender with respect to such payment (to the extent of
the interests in Tranche A so assigned to the Board). No payment by the Board to
the Agent or any Tranche A Lender under the Board Guaranty shall reduce,
discharge, satisfy, modify or terminate the corresponding payment or any other
obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or any Tranche A Note, which
obligations shall remain in full force and effect.

                (i)     Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the
        Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the
        Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be,
        will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower or
        such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may
        (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
        corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the
        extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Agent in
        immediately available funds, then:

                                (A)     if the Borrower failed to make such
                        payment, each Lender (or the Board, if applicable) shall
                        forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the portion of
                        such assumed payment that was made available to such
                        Lender (or the Board, if applicable) in immediately
                        available funds, together with interest thereon in
                        respect of each day from and including the date such
                        amount was made available by the Agent to such Lender
                        (or the Board, if applicable) to the

                                       36

<PAGE>

                        date such amount is repaid to the Agent in immediately
                        available funds, at the applicable Federal Funds Rate
                        (as defined in the definition of "Base Rate Loan") from
                        time to time in effect; and

                                (B)     if any Lender failed to make such
                        payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to
                        the Agent the amount thereof in immediately available
                        funds, together with interest thereon for the period
                        from the date such amount was made available by the
                        Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is
                        recovered by the Agent (the "Compensation Period") at a
                        rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds
                        Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays
                        such amount to the Agent, then such amount shall
                        constitute such Lender's Loan included in the applicable
                        borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount
                        forthwith upon the Agent's demand therefor, the Agent
                        may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the
                        Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent, together
                        with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a
                        rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable
                        to the applicable borrowing. Nothing herein shall be
                        deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
                        fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which
                        the Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as
                        a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                (ii)    A notice of the Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
        respect to any amount owing under this subsection (g) shall be
        conclusive, absent manifest error.

                Section 2.10.   Certain Provisions Governing the Loan.

                (a)     Determination of Interest Rate. The Tranche A Applicable
Interest Rate and the Tranche B Applicable Interest Rate shall be determined by
the Agent and, to the extent applicable, the KHFC Administrative Agent, pursuant
to the procedures set forth in the definition of "Tranche A Applicable Interest
Rate" and "LIBOR", and shall promptly thereafter be notified to the Borrower,
the Board, the Primary Tranche A Lender or the Alternate Tranche A Lender, as
applicable, and each Tranche B Lender.

                (b)     Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair. In
the event that: (i) the Agent determines that adequate and fair means do not
exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rates by reference to which the
LIBOR then being determined is to be fixed or (ii) the Requisite LIBOR Lenders
notify the Agent that the LIBOR for any Interest Period will not adequately
reflect the cost to the LIBOR Lenders of making or maintaining the portion of
the loan for which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR for
such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower, the
Board, the Loan Administrator and the Lenders, whereupon during the thirty (30)
days following the date of any such notice the Borrower, the Agent and the LIBOR
Lenders shall negotiate in good faith (subject to the consent of the Board) in
order to arrive at a mutually acceptable alternative basis for determining the
interest rate from time to time applicable to Tranche A or Tranche B, as
applicable, (the "Substitute Basis"). If within the twenty (20) days following
the date of any such notice the Borrower, the Agent and the LIBOR Lenders shall
agree upon, and the Board shall consent to, a Substitute Basis, such Substitute
Basis shall be retroactive to and effective from the first day of the then
current Interest Period until and including the last day of such Interest
Period. If after twenty (20) days from the date of such notice, the Borrower,
the Agent and the LIBOR Lenders shall have failed to agree upon, or the Board
shall have failed to consent to, a Substitute Basis, then the Agent (upon
instructions from the Requisite LIBOR Lenders) shall certify in writing to the
Borrower (such certification to be conclusive and binding on all LIBOR Lenders
and all other parties hereto absent manifest error) the interest rate at which
the LIBOR

                                       37

<PAGE>

Lenders are prepared to maintain their portion of the Loan for such Interest
Period, it being understood that such Lenders' interest rate shall be at a rate
per annum equal to a rate which adequately and fairly reflects the cost to such
Lenders of obtaining the funds necessary to maintain their portion of the Loan
for such Interest Period. If no Substitute Basis is established, upon receipt of
notice of the interest rates at which the Requisite LIBOR Lenders are prepared
to maintain their respective portion of the Loan, the Borrower shall have the
right exercisable upon ten (10) Business Days' prior notice to the Lenders, the
Board and the Loan Administrator through the Agent (i) to continue to borrow the
Loan at the interest rate so advised by the Agent (as such rate may be modified,
from time to time, at the outset of each subsequent Interest Period), (ii) to
convert the Loan to a Base Rate Loan, or (iii) to prepay in full the Loan
together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the interest rate certified
in writing by the Requisite LIBOR Lenders as provided above and all other
amounts due under the Loan Documents, whereupon the Loan shall become due and
payable on the date specified by the Borrower in such notice.

                (c)     Increased Costs. If at any time any Lender or Program
Support Provider shall determine that as a result of the introduction of or any
change after the date hereof in or in the interpretation of any law, treaty or
governmental rule, regulation or order or the compliance by such Lender or
Program Support Provider with any guideline, request or directive after the date
hereof from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender
or Program Support Provider of agreeing to make or making, funding, guaranteeing
or maintaining any portion of the Loan (except in respect of Taxes), then the
Borrower shall from time to time, within five (5) Business Days of a demand
(which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for
such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail) by
such Lender or Program Support Provider (with a copy of such demand to the
Agent, the Board and the Loan Administrator), pay to the Agent for the account
of such Lender or Program Support Provider additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender or Program Support Provider for such increased cost;
provided that no Lender or Program Support Provider shall be entitled to claim
any such additional amount for amounts incurred more than six (6) months prior
to the making of such demand. A certificate as to the amount of such increased
cost, submitted to the Borrower (and the Agent and the Board) by such Lender or
Program Support Provider shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error. Each Lender or Program Support Provider shall promptly
notify in writing the Borrower, the Agent and the Board of any event of which
such Lender or Program Support Provider has knowledge, occurring after the date
hereof, which would entitle such Lender or Program Support Provider to
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) and will designate a different
lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or Program
Support Provider be otherwise materially disadvantageous to it.

                (d)     Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if any Lender determines that the introduction of or any change in or
in the interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or
order after the date of this Agreement shall make it unlawful, or any central
bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for such
Lender to maintain its portion of the Loan, then, on notice thereof by such
Lender to the Borrower through the Agent (with a copy to the Board and the Loan
Administrator), the obligation of such Lender to continue to fund or maintain
its portion of the Loan shall be terminated and the Borrower shall either (i)
convert the affected portion of the Loan of such Lender to a Base Rate Loan,
either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may
lawfully continue to maintain its portion of the Loan based on LIBOR to such
day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
portion of the Loan based on LIBOR or (ii) prepay such affected portion of the
Loan to such Lender together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon and all
other sums payable hereunder with respect thereto on the last day of the then
current Interest Period or earlier if necessary to avoid such illegality. Any
such partial prepayment

                                       38

<PAGE>

of the Loan shall be applied ratably to the then unpaid installments thereof in
accordance with the amount of each such unpaid installment.

                (e)     Breakage Costs. In addition to all amounts required to
be paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.7, the Borrower shall compensate
each Tranche B Lender, and, to the extent Tranche A has been funded by the
Alternate Tranche A Lender or Tranche A has been assigned by the Primary Tranche
A Lender to the Alternate Tranche A Lender pursuant to Section 11.2 or the
Primary Tranche A Lender has funded Tranche A other than through the issuance of
Commercial Paper, each Tranche A Lender), upon demand, for all losses, expenses
and liabilities (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
or the termination of any other financial arrangement it may have entered into
to fund or maintain or support such Lender's portion of the Loan, but excluding
Taxes) which that Lender may sustain (i) if for any reason the proposed
Borrowing does not occur on a date specified therefor in the Notice of Borrowing
given by a Borrower in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) subject to the
Borrower's right to utilize the Prepayment Breakage Avoidance Procedure, if for
any reason any portion of the Loan is prepaid (including mandatorily pursuant to
Section 2.6 or this Section 2.10) on a date which is not the last day of the
applicable Interest Period or (iii) as a consequence of any failure by a
Borrower to repay any portion of the Loan when required by the terms hereof. The
Lender making demand for such compensation shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Agent, the Board and the Loan Administrator) concurrently with such
demand a written statement as to such losses, expenses and liabilities, and this
statement shall be conclusive as to the amount of compensation due to that
Lender absent manifest error, and such compensation shall be paid to the Agent
for the account of such Lender. Such compensation shall not exceed an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest that would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed or repaid, for the period
from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow or repay to the
last day of the then applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure to borrow) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loan
provided for in this Agreement over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount
by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in
the LIBOR market (it being understood that the Borrower shall not be required to
indemnify any Lender for lost profits other than to the extent included in
clause (a) above).

                (f)     Primary Tranche A Lender Prepayment Compensation. In
connection with all prepayments under Sections 2.5 and 2.6, if the Primary
Tranche A Lender is the Tranche A Lender and is funding Tranche A through the
issuance of Commercial Paper, the Borrower shall pay to the Primary Tranche A
Lender within 10 Business Days of demand an amount equal to (i) the amount of
interest that would have accrued on the amount prepaid during the Liquidation
Period (as defined below) less (ii) the amount of the investment earnings, if
any, received as reasonably determined by the KHFC Administrative Agent, on the
prepayment amount during the Liquidation Period. As used herein, "Liquidation
Period" means the period from the date on which a prepayment is made to the date
on which the Primary Tranche A Lender's total amount of Commercial Paper related
to the funding of Tranche A is reduced (without prepayment thereof) by an amount
equal to the amount of the Borrower's prepayment.

                (g)     Eurocurrency Liabilities. The Borrower shall pay to each
Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds
or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest
on the unpaid principal amount of such Lender's portion of the Loan equal to the
actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as
determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is
payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received from such Lender
at least 15 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Agent, the Board and the Loan
Administrator) of such additional interest. If a Lender fails to

                                       39

<PAGE>

give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional
interest shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.

                Section 2.11.   Capital Adequacy. If at any time any Lender or
Program Support Provider determines that (a) the adoption of or any change in or
in the interpretation of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or
order after the date of this Agreement regarding capital adequacy, (b)
compliance with any such law, treaty, rule, regulation, or order or (c)
compliance with any guideline or request or directive from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority or any accounting board or authority (whether or
not a Governmental Authority) which is responsible for the establishment or
interpretation of national or international accounting principles (in each case,
whether or not having the force of law) shall have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's or Program Support Provider's (or any
corporation controlling such Lender's or Program Support Provider's) capital as
a consequence of its obligations hereunder (other than with respect to Taxes) to
a level below that which such Lender, Program Support Provider or corporation
could have achieved but for such adoption, change, compliance or interpretation,
then, upon demand from time to time by such Lender or Program Support Provider
(with a copy of such demand to the Agent and the Board), the Borrower shall
within five (5) Business Days of such demand pay to the Agent for the account of
such Lender or Program Support Provider from time to time as specified by such
Lender or Program Support Provider additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender or Program Support Provider for such reduction; provided that the
Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Program Support
Provider pursuant to this Section 2.11 for any amounts incurred more than six
(6) months prior to the date of such demand. A certificate as to such amounts
submitted to the Borrower (and the Agent and the Board) by such Lender or
Program Support Provider shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent
manifest error. Each Lender or Program Support Provider shall promptly notify
the Borrower, the Agent and the Board of any event of which such Lender or
Program Support Provider has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which
would entitle such Lender or Program Support Provider to compensation pursuant
to this Section 2.11 and will designate a different lending office if such
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
and will not, in the judgment of such Lender or Program Support Provider, be
otherwise disadvantageous to it. For the avoidance of doubt, any interpretation
of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (including Interpretation No. 46 - Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities) shall constitute an adoption, change, request or directive, and any
implementation thereof shall be, subject to this Section 2.11.

                Section 2.12.   Taxes.

                (a)     No Withholding, etc. Except as otherwise provided in the
next sentence and Section 11.2, any and all payments by the Obligors under each
Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and
all Taxes, excluding (i) in the case of each Lender, the Loan Administrator,
each Participant and the Agent, Taxes measured by its net income and franchise
Taxes imposed on it by the jurisdiction under the laws of which it is organized
or is otherwise doing business (other than a jurisdiction in which such Person
is deemed to be doing business solely as a result of entering into, or
performing its obligations under, any Loan Document), (ii) in the case of each
Lender and each Participant, Taxes measured by its net income and franchise
Taxes imposed on it by the jurisdiction in which its Lending Office is located
or in which it booked its participation for tax accounting purposes, (iii) in
the case of each Lender, the Loan Administrator, each Participant and the Agent,
Taxes imposed on it as a result of its failure to comply with its obligations
under Section 2.12(f), Section 2.12(g) or Section 11.2, (iv) in the case of each
Lender, the Loan Administrator, each Participant and the Agent (A) that is a
party hereto or Participant, as the case may be, on the Closing Date, United
States federal withholding Taxes except to the extent imposed as a result of a
change in applicable law, including income tax conventions, after the Closing
Date and (B) that becomes a party hereto or Participant, as the case may be,
after the Closing Date, United States federal withholding Taxes except to

                                       40

<PAGE>

the extent imposed as a result of a change in applicable law, including income
tax conventions, after the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to
which it becomes a Lender or after the date such Person becomes a Participant,
the Loan Administrator or the Agent, as applicable, and (v) Taxes imposed as a
result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Lender, the Loan
Administrator, any Participant or the Agent, as the case may be (all such
non-excluded Taxes being hereinafter referred to as "Indemnified Taxes"). If any
Indemnified Taxes shall be required by law to be deducted from or in respect of
any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or
the Agent (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Lender, the Loan
Administrator or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Obligors
shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Obligors shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.

                (b)     Other Taxes. In addition, the Obligors agree to pay any
present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies of the United States or any political
subdivision thereof or any applicable foreign jurisdiction which arise from any
payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (collectively,
"Other Taxes") to the Agent for the account of the affected party.

                (c)     Tax Indemnity. The Obligors will indemnify each Lender,
the Agent and the Loan Administrator for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes (including any Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable
under this Section 2.12) paid by such Lender, the Loan Administrator or the
Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including for penalties, interest
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, other than any
liability, including for penalties, interest and expenses, arising from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender, the Loan Administrator or
the Agent, as the case may be. This indemnification shall be made to the Agent
for account of the relevant Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Agent, as the
case may be, within 30 days from the date such Lender, the Loan Administrator,
or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor (with a copy to
the Agent if made by a Lender or the Loan Administrator and accompanied by a
statement setting forth the basis for such taxation and the calculation of the
amount thereof in reasonable detail).

                (d)     Evidence of Payment. Within 30 days after the date of
any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the Obligors will furnish to
the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

                (e)     Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Obligors hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
parties contained in this Section 2.12 shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations.

                (f)     Certain Withholding Tax Matters. Each Lender, each
Participant, the Loan Administrator and the Agent that is a Non-U.S. Person and
that is entitled at such time to an exemption from United States withholding
tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate under an applicable tax
treaty, shall, on or prior to the Closing Date or on or prior to the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender or on or prior
to the date such Person becomes a Participant, the Loan Administrator or the
Agent, as applicable, and from time to time thereafter if requested by the Agent
or the Obligors, provide the Agent and the Obligors with two completed copies of
either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form, certificate or
document prescribed by the IRS certifying as to such Non-U.S. Person's
entitlement to such exemption from United States withholding tax or reduced

                                       41

<PAGE>

rate with respect to all payments to be made to such Non-U.S. Person under the
Loan Documents. In addition, each Lender, each Participant, the Loan
Administrator and the Agent that is a Non-U.S. Person, as the case may be, shall
deliver to the Obligors and the Agent, notice of any event (other than a change
in applicable law, including income tax conventions) requiring a change in the
most recent form previously delivered by such Person to the Obligors and the
Agent. Each Lender, each Participant, the Loan Administrator and Agent (other
than an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Internal Revenue Code shall deliver two duly signed and completed copies of
IRS Form W-9 to the Agent and the Obligors, at the times and in the manner
described above with respect to IRS Forms W-8. Unless the Agent and the Obligors
have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that
payments under the Loan Documents are not subject to United States withholding
tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty,
the Agent or the Obligors shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
2.12(a) and (c) and without impairing any obligation of the Obligors under this
Section 2.12 with respect to such tax, withhold such United States withholding
taxes from such payments at the appropriate rate, and the Obligors shall not be
obligated to pay additional amounts to any Person under this Section 2.12;
provided that if such Person is a Lender, Participant, Agent or Loan
Administrator and shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 2.12(f)
on the date it became a Lender, Participant, Agent or Loan Administrator,
nothing in this Section 2.12(f) shall relieve the Obligors of its obligation to
pay any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.12 in the event that, as a result of
any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or
order, or any change in governmental interpretation, administration or
application thereof, such Lender, Participant, Agent or Loan Administrator is no
longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
subsequent date establishing that it is not subject to withholding or is subject
to withholding at a reduced rate. The obligation of the Lenders and Participants
under this Section 2.12 shall survive the repayment of all other Obligations
hereunder and the resignation of the Agent.

                (g)     Mitigation. Any Lender claiming any additional amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall use its reasonable efforts
(consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
which would be payable or may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

                Section 2.13.   Limitations with respect to RSA. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, RSA, as an initial Tranche B Lender,
shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.10(b) or Section 2.11;
provided, however, that any permitted assignee or participant of RSA which is a
bank organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 2.10(b) and Section 2.11 (subject, in the
case of any permitted participant, to the limitation set forth in Section
11.2(e)).

                                   ARTICLE III

                          CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO LOAN

                The obligation of the Primary Tranche A Lender and the Alternate
Tranche A Lender to make Tranche A available and the Tranche B Lenders to make
Tranche B available as requested on the Closing Date, and the Board to issue the
Board Guaranty, is subject to the satisfaction (in the judgment of the Agent,
the Board and the Lenders (except as otherwise provided below in this Article
III)) of all of the following conditions precedent (other than, with respect to
the issuance of the Board Guaranty, subsection (a)(iii) below, and other than
with respect to subsection (o) below, which condition shall occur concurrently):

                                       42

<PAGE>

                (a)     Certain Agreements and Documents. The Agent, the Primary
Tranche A Lender, the Alternate Tranche A Lender, the Tranche B Lenders and the
Board shall have received on or prior to the Closing Date each of the following
(with only the Agent receiving originals of the Notes and with only the Board
and the Tranche B Lenders receiving the Warrants and the Registration Rights
Agreement), each dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Agent, the Board, the Primary Tranche A Lender, the
Alternate Tranche A Lender and the Tranche B Lenders (except that the Warrants
and the Registration Rights Agreement need only be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Board and the Tranche B Lenders):

                (i)     this Agreement, duly executed and delivered by the
        parties hereto;

                (ii)    the Notes, duly executed by the Borrower and conforming
        to the requirements set forth in Section 2.4(d);

                (iii)   the Board Guaranty, duly executed and delivered by the
        parties thereto;

                (iv)    the Collateral Documents specified in clauses (i)
        through (vii) of the definition thereof, duly executed and delivered by
        the parties thereto, together with (A) financing statements in form and
        substance reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent, as may be
        required or advisable to grant, continue and maintain an enforceable
        security interest in the Collateral (subject to the terms hereof and of
        the other Loan Documents) in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code
        as enacted in all relevant jurisdictions; (B) evidence of the filing for
        recordation with the FAA of such Collateral Documents (together with any
        other necessary documents, instruments, affidavits or certificates) as
        may be required in order to perfect and maintain the security interest
        in the Collateral, perfection of a security interest in which requires a
        filing for recordation with the FAA; (C) insurance certificates and
        brokers' reports evidencing the insurance coverages required under the
        Loan Documents, including with respect to the Collateral (in accordance

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                To induce the other parties (excluding any other Obligors) to
enter into this Agreement and to induce the Board to issue the Board Guaranty,
each of Group and the Borrower represents and warrants to each other party
hereto (excluding any other Obligors) that, on and as of the Closing Date, after
giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan (references to "Obligors"
contained in this Article IV shall be limited to Obligors as of the Closing
Date):

                Section 4.1.    Organization, Powers, Qualification, Good
Standing, Business, Subsidiaries, the Act and the Regulations.

                (a)     Organization, Power and Authority. Each Obligor is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Obligor has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business
as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Loan
Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

                (b)     Foreign Qualification; "Air Carrier Status". Each
Obligor is qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction
where its assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its business
and operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Borrower is an "air carrier" within the meaning of the Act and holds
a certificate under Section 41102 of Title 49. Each of the Borrower and any
other Obligor engaged in operations as an "air carrier" is a "citizen of the
United States" within the meaning of Section 40102(a)(15) of Title 49, as
interpreted by the United States Department of Transportation (a "United States
Citizen") and holds an air carrier operating certificate issued pursuant to
Chapter 447 of Title 49 for aircraft capable of carrying 10 or more individuals
or 6,000 pounds or more of cargo. Each Obligor possesses all necessary
certificates, franchises, licenses, permits, rights and concessions and consents
which are material to the conduct of its business and operations as currently
conducted (including in the case of each Obligor engaged in operations as an
"air carrier", the operation of the routes flown by it), a true and complete
list of which are set forth on Schedule 4.1(b).

                (c)     Subsidiaries. All of the Subsidiaries of each Obligor
and all other Persons in which any Obligor owns any Capital Stock, in each case,
as of the Closing Date, are identified in Schedule 4.1(c). Schedule 4.1(c)
correctly sets forth as of the Closing Date the equity and voting interest of
the Borrower and Group in each of the Subsidiaries identified therein. There are
no limitations on the rights of the Borrower and Group to vote the Capital Stock
it owns of any Person listed on Schedule 4.1(c). Airways Assurance Limited LLC,
a Bermuda corporation, is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Group whose business is
limited to securing insurance for the Obligors.

                                       47

<PAGE>

                (d)     Eligible Borrower. The Borrower is an "eligible
borrower" within the meaning of the Act and the Regulations, it does not have
any outstanding delinquent Federal debt (including tax liabilities and after
giving effect to any settlement and compromises reached in the Bankruptcy Cases
and distributions made or to be made on account of such claims), and the
Application, the Loan and the transactions contemplated hereby (assuming that
each of the Primary Tranche A Lender, the Alternate Tranche A Lender and the
Tranche B Lenders is an Eligible Lender) comply with the requirements of the Act
and the Regulations.

                Section 4.2.    Authorization of Borrowing, etc.

                (a)     Authorization. Each Obligor has duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party.

                (b)     No Conflicts. After giving effect to the Consummation of
the Plan, the execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of the Loan
Documents and the Specified Contracts to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the
Specified Contracts to which it is a party do not and will not (i) violate any
provision of any law or any governmental rule or regulation applicable to any
Obligor, the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws of any Obligor
or any order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government
binding on any Obligor, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute
(with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default or (other than under the
DIP Loan Agreement) require any payment under (A) any Loan Document or any
Specified Contract or (B) any other Contractual Obligation of any Obligor,
except that with respect to clause (B), for any such conflict, breach, default
or requirement of payment which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of any Obligor (other than the
Liens created under the Collateral Documents) or (iv) require any approval of
stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person under any Contractual
Obligation of any Obligor, except for such approvals or consents (A) which will
have been obtained on or before the Closing Date and have been disclosed in
writing to the Agent and the Board or (B) with respect to any Contractual
Obligation other than the Specified Contracts, which if not obtained, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (c)     No Consents, Approvals, etc. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Obligor of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to which
such Obligor is a party do not and will not require any registration with,
consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any
federal, state or other Governmental Authority or regulatory body or any other
Person which is required to be obtained or made on or prior to the Closing Date
and which has not been obtained or made, except as is disclosed on Schedule
4.2(c).

                (d)     Execution, Delivery, Enforceability. Each Obligor has
duly executed and delivered each of the Loan Documents to which it is party and
after giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, each such Loan Document is
the valid and binding obligation of such Obligor, enforceable against such
Obligor in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other
similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, including materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing,
and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

Board and the Loan Administrator the audited consolidated balance sheets of the
Borrower and Group as at December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Borrower and
Group for the Fiscal Year then ended. All such financial statements were
prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Borrower and Group as at the date
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Borrower and Group for the period then ended.

                (b)     After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan and
the Borrowing and to the application of the proceeds therefrom, (i) without
taking into account unforeseen adverse effects on travel and the airline
industry from the war in Iraq, the Obligors taken as a whole are Solvent and
(ii) no Obligor has any material liability, including reasonably likely
contingent liability or liability for taxes, long-term lease or any unusual
forward or long-term commitment of a type required to be reflected in financial
statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, that is not reflected in the
projections and pro forma financial information delivered pursuant to clause (l)
of Article III or taken into account in the preparation of the Borrower's annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

                (c)     The Obligors maintain, in accordance with sound business
practices and applicable law and rules and regulations issued by any
Governmental Authority (i) a system of accounting, which includes maintenance of
proper books and records, to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (A) transactions
are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization;
(B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
and (C) utilization and disposition of assets are permitted only in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization; and (ii) effective
disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-14 and
15d-14 of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Obligors is made known to Group and the Borrower and their
Responsible Officers in a timely manner.

                (d)     Other than as disclosed on Schedule 4.3(d) or as
disclosed in Group's or the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal
Year ended December 31, 2002, none of Group, the Borrower or any other Obligor
is a party to any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (within the meaning of Item
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
amended by SEC Release No. 33-8182 (January 28, 2003)).

                Section 4.4.    No Material Adverse Change; No Restricted
Payments. Since the Final Approval Date, no material adverse change has occurred
in the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
prospects or properties of the Obligors, taken as a whole, or in the Borrower's
ability to repay the Loan or perform its obligations under the Loan Documents,
or with respect to any of the matters covered by the representations and
warranties made in the Borrower's Application (it being understood that
unforeseen changes resulting from the effects of the war in Iraq on travel and
the airline industry shall be deemed not to constitute a breach of this
representation). Since the Final Approval Date, no Obligor has directly or
indirectly declared, ordered, paid or made, or set apart any sum or property
for, any Restricted Payment or agreed to do so except as would have been
permitted by Section 6.3, as if such section were in effect at all times after
such date. After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan and the Borrowing
and the application of the proceeds therefrom on the Closing Date, no event or
occurrence which would constitute a Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing or would result from such Borrowing.

                                       49

good, marketable and insurable fee title to (in the case of fee interests in
real property), (ii) valid, and in the case of leasehold interests in real
property, insurable, leasehold interests in (in the case of leasehold interests
in real or personal property) or (iii) good title to (in the case of all other
personal property) all of the properties and assets necessary to the conduct of
its business including property and assets reflected in the financial statements
referred to in Section 4.3, except for assets disposed of since the date of such
financial statements in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to the
restructuring contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. Except as otherwise
permitted by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents, all such properties
and assets are free and clear of Liens.

                Section 4.6.    Litigation; Adverse Facts. There are no actions,
suits, proceedings, arbitrations or investigations (whether or not purportedly
on behalf of Group, the Borrower or any other Obligor) at law or in equity or
before or by any Governmental Authority pending or, to the knowledge of any
Responsible Officer of Group or the Borrower, threatened against or affecting
(in either case, whether asserted or unasserted) any of the Obligors or any
property of the Obligors that, individually or in the aggregate, (a) except for
matters disclosed on Schedule 4.6, in the reasonable judgment of the Obligors
could be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) challenge the
legality, validity or binding effect of, or seeks to restrain or enjoin any
Obligor from entering into or performing under, any Loan Document including,
without limitation, this Agreement or any Collateral Document. No Obligor is
subject to any final judgments, writs, injunctions or decrees of any court or
any Governmental Authority, compliance with which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, or is in default with respect to any such

                (a)     Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.7(a): (i)
the Obligors have timely filed all material Tax returns and reports required to
have been filed, and have paid or made adequate provision for payment of all
material Taxes levied or imposed upon them or their properties (including the
Collateral), income or assets that have become due and payable, except (A) in
those instances in which such Taxes are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and for which adequate reserves
have been made in accordance with GAAP and (B) that the Obligors' obligations to
pay Taxes that relate to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases and which first became due and payable
after the time of the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, have been stayed or
enjoined pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Confirmation Order or the
Bankruptcy Code, it being understood that the exception in this clause (B) does
not affect the Obligors' representation that they have made adequate provision
for such Taxes; (ii) there is no proposed Tax assessment against any Obligor

<PAGE>

Contractual Obligations, other than, with respect to clause (ii), defaults which
are not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition
exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute such a default; it being understood that the existence on the Closing
Date of any default under (x) any aircraft financing transaction that is the
subject of a term sheet or an agreement under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code, in each case listed as a Specified Contract on Schedule 4.15(a), (y)
certain other executory contracts and unexpired leases that the Obligors are
entitled to reject in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization or prior order
of the Bankruptcy Court and (z) certain other contracts relating to property

                (b)     No Adverse Agreements. No Obligor is a party to or is
otherwise subject to any agreements or instruments or any charter or other
internal restrictions which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably

their payment or other material obligations under the Loan Documents.

                (c)     Other Agreements. Except as disclosed on Schedule
4.8(c), no Obligor is a party to or is otherwise subject to any agreement or
arrangement, including, but not limited to, agreements relating to Indebtedness,

adverse change in the credit rating of an Obligor, (ii) an adverse change in the
financial ratios, earnings, cash flow or stock price of an Obligor or (iii)
changes in the value of underlying, linked or indexed assets, except to the
extent that such agreements or arrangements could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                Section 4.9.    Governmental Regulation. No Obligor is subject
to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940 or under any other federal or
state statute or regulation (other than the Bankruptcy Code) which may limit its
ability to incur Indebtedness or which may otherwise render all or any portion
of its Obligations unenforceable.

                Section 4.10.   Securities Activities. No Obligor owns or is
engaged principally in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock, nor shall any proceeds of the Loan be
used to purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to any Person for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock in a manner that violates or
causes a violation of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board of Governors.

                Section 4.11.   Employee Benefit Plans.

                (a)     Schedule 4.11(a) lists each Plan and each Multiemployer

any of its ERISA Affiliates as of the Closing Date. Each Plan has been operated
and administered in compliance with all applicable requirements of ERISA, and,
if intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, in compliance with all applicable requirements of such provisions except
where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have, taking all
instances in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)     Full payment has been made by Group or any of its ERISA
Affiliates of all minimum amounts which such entities are required to pay under
the terms of each Plan and Multiemployer Plan except where the failure to so
comply, taking all instances in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (c)     After giving effect to the termination of the Retirement
Income Plan for Pilots of US Airways, Inc. and the discharge of the liabilities
thereunder through consummation of the Plan of Reorganization, no ERISA Event
has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with
all other ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (d)     Neither Group nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintains
or contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA) which provides benefits to retired employees or other former employees
(other than as required by Section 601 of ERISA) or any employee pension benefit
plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), other than a Plan the obligations
with respect to which, when taken together with the projected contributions
thereto reflected in the projections and pro forma financial information
delivered pursuant to clause (l) of Article III, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (e)     After giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, no
Plan maintained by Group or any ERISA Affiliate is underfunded (based on the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations thereunder) except to the
extent that the aggregate amount of underfunding with respect to all such plans,
when taken together with the projected contributions thereto reflected in the
projections and pro forma financial information delivered pursuant to clause (l)
of Article III, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                Section 4.12.   Environmental Protection.

                (a)     Compliance with Environmental Laws. All Facilities and
operations of each Obligor are, and have been to the knowledge of each Obligor,
in compliance with all Environmental Laws except for any noncompliance which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)     Hazardous Materials Activity. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 4.12, there are no, and have been no, conditions, occurrences, or
Hazardous Materials Activity (i) arising at any Facilities or (ii) arising in
connection with the operations of the Obligors or of past or current Affiliates
of any Obligor (while under the control of an Obligor or otherwise to the
knowledge of an Obligor) (including the transportation of Hazardous Materials in
accordance with applicable regulations), which conditions, occurrences or
Hazardous Materials Activity could reasonably be expected to form the basis of
an Environmental Claim against any Obligor and which, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (c)     Environmental Claims. Except as disclosed on Schedule
4.12, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of any Obligor, threatened
Environmental Claims against any Obligor, and no Obligor has received any
notices, inquiries, or requests for information with respect to any
Environmental Claims which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                (d)     Orders, Decrees, etc. No Obligor is currently operating
or required to be operating under any compliance order, schedule, decree or
agreement, any consent decree, order or agreement, and/or any corrective action
decree, order or agreement issued or entered into under any Environmental Law
the failure to comply with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                Section 4.13.   Disclosure. (a) No representation or warranty or
certification of any Obligor or of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower or
Group or any other Officer of any Obligor contained in this Agreement, any other
Loan Document, the Application or in any other document,

                                       52

<PAGE>

certificate or written statement furnished to the Board, the Agent or the
Lenders by or on behalf of any Obligor (as modified or supplemented by other
written information so furnished) for use in connection with the negotiation and
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein at the time, and in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; (b) neither the Borrower's or Group's filings
under the Exchange Act (as amended or supplemented through the date hereof) nor
the Disclosure Statement (as amended or supplemented through the date hereof)
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; and (c) the Application taken
together with all other written information furnished to the Board by or on
behalf of the Obligors for use in connection with the negotiation and closing of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; provided that, with respect to
projected financial information contained in any such document or furnished to
any party hereto by or on behalf of the Obligors, the Borrower and Group
represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being recognized that such
projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual
results during the period or periods covered thereby may differ from the
projected results.

                Section 4.14.   Compliance with Laws. Each Obligor is in
compliance with all laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders binding on or
applicable to such Obligor, and all of its properties, except to the extent
failure to so comply (either individually or in the aggregate) could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                Section 4.15.   Specified Contracts. The Borrower has heretofore
delivered to the Board and the Agent a true and correct schedule identifying the
Specified Contracts and has made available to the Board and the Agent true and
correct copies of the Specified Contracts which Specified Contracts have not
been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof. After
giving effect to the Loan and application of the proceeds therefrom, the
Specified Contracts are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Obligors and to the knowledge of the Responsible
Officers of Group and the Borrower, the counter-parties thereto (as applicable),
enforceable against each in accordance with their respective terms, except as
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally, including materiality, reasonableness, good faith
and fair dealing, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), except that certain of the
Specified Contracts, as so identified on Schedule 4.15(a), are subject to
completion of final definitive documentation. The Specified Contracts are
reasonably expected by the Borrower and Group to result in the aggregate
Concession Value summarized on Schedule 4.15(b).

                Section 4.16.   Indebtedness. Schedule 4.16 correctly sets forth
the consolidated Indebtedness of Group and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date and identifies each primary obligor and each guarantor or other secondary
obligor thereof, if any.

                Section 4.17.   Insurance. The properties, business and
operations of the Obligors are insured or reinsured with financially sound and
reputable insurance companies or by the United States of America, in such
amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks as are insured against
(including, but not limited to, war risk and third party liability) and carried
in accordance with applicable law and prudent industry practice by major U.S.
commercial air carriers similarly situated with the Obligors and owning or
operating similar properties, aircraft and engines.

                Section 4.18.   Perfected Security Interests. The Collateral
Agent, on behalf of the Lenders and the Board, has valid security interests in
the Collateral, with such priority and perfected to such extent as is provided
in the Collateral Documents.

                Section 4.19.   Compliance with the Plan of Reorganization. No
Obligor is in default with respect to any obligation under the Plan of the
Reorganization.

                Section 4.20.   Absence of Labor Disputes. No strikes, boycotts,
work stoppages or lockouts with respect to any of the Obligors exist, and no
Obligor has received written notice, sanctioned by any collective bargaining
unit representing employees of such Obligor, threatening a strike, boycott or
work stoppage.

                Section 4.21.   Compliance with certain Gate Leases. After
giving effect to the Consummation of the Plan, each Obligor is in compliance in
all material respects with all Gate Leases with respect to the airports listed
on Schedule 4.21.

                Section 4.22.   Slot Utilization. Each Obligor which holds or
operates Slots is utilizing its Slots in a manner consistent with the Slot
Regulations in order to avoid the withdrawal of any Slot (other than Slots of
the type referenced in clauses (f) through (i) of the definition of "Secondary
Slots") by the FAA, taking into account any waivers or other relief granted by
the FAA in connection with the failure to utilize Slots. None of the Obligors
has received any notice of withdrawal from the FAA, nor (other than with respect
to Slots of the type referenced in clauses (d) and (f) through (i) of the
definition of "Secondary Slots") is any Obligor aware of any other event or
circumstance (other than any proposed change of law, regulation or rule), that
could reasonably be expected to result in the withdrawal of any Slot or
otherwise impair any of the Slots or the value thereof (it being understood,
however, that the Slot Regulations provide for withdrawal in certain
circumstances other than for failure to utilize Slots, and the FAA has asserted
the right to withdraw and reallocate "pool" Slots (within the meaning of 14
C.F.R. Section 93.226(e)), including those identified on Schedule 1.1(a) hereto,
at its discretion). The Obligors maintain personnel, policies, procedures and a
computer database for the monitoring, utilization and management of the Slots in
compliance with the Slot Regulations so as to ensure, to the greatest extent
operationally feasible, that the Slot Regulations are complied with and no Slot
becomes subject to withdrawal by the FAA.

                                       59

<PAGE>

preserve any such corporate, partnership or other existence, if in each case,
the Chief Executive Officer of Group or the Borrower shall determine in the
exercise of his or her business judgment that the preservation thereof is no
longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Obligors taken as a whole
and that abandonment of any such right, permit, license or franchise or failure
to preserve such existence could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                Section 5.3.    Payment of Taxes and Claims. Group and the
Borrower will, and they will cause each other Obligor to, pay or discharge or
cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (i) all

property of an Obligor except (a) that this Section 5.3 shall not require the
Obligors to pay Taxes that relate to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on
or before the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases and which first became due
and payable after the time of the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases, to the
extent that, and for so long as, such Taxes are stayed or enjoined pursuant to
the Plan of Reorganization, the Confirmation Order or the Bankruptcy Code, it
being understood that notwithstanding the exception in this clause (a), the
Obligors shall make adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP for Taxes stayed

Taxes are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which

and any Subsidiary of the Group or the Borrower).

and they will cause each other Obligor to, maintain all properties used or
useful in the conduct of the business of the Obligors in good condition, repair
and working order (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and supply such properties
with all necessary equipment and make all necessary repairs, renewals,
replacements, betterments and improvements thereto, all as in the reasonable
judgment of the Borrower may be necessary so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times;
provided, however, that no Obligor shall be restricted from discontinuing the
operation and maintenance of any such properties if such discontinuance is, in
the good faith judgment of Group, desirable in the conduct of the business of
such Obligor and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, but subject in each case to all applicable provisions of the Collateral
Documents.

                (b)     Insurance. Group and the Borrower will, and they will
cause each other Obligor to, insure and keep insured or reinsured with

the Obligors or by the United States of America, their businesses and operations
and such of their respective properties, in such amounts, with such deductibles
and covering such risks as are insured against (including, but not limited to,
war risk and third party liability) and carried in accordance with applicable
law and prudent industry practice by U.S. commercial air carriers similarly
situated with the Obligors and owning or operating similar properties, aircraft
and engines, including such insurance coverage as is required to be maintained
under the Collateral Documents, and providing for not less than thirty (30)
days' (or in the case of war risk coverage, the maximum time as is available)
prior notice to the Agent, the Board, the Loan Administrator and the Collateral
Agent of termination, lapse or cancellation of such insurance or reinsurance;
provided that this Section 5.4(b) shall not prohibit any Obligor from procuring
and maintaining all or any portion of its insurance through Airways Assurance

properties of the Obligors, including their financial and accounting records,
and to make copies and take extracts therefrom, and to discuss their affairs,
finances and accounts with its and their officers and independent public
accountants (it being understood that a representative of the Borrower or Group
will be present), at the Borrower's expense, all upon reasonable notice and at
such reasonable times during normal business hours and as often as may be
reasonably requested; provided that so long as the Lenders and/or the Board, as
applicable, are not exercising material remedies under the Loan Documents, such
inspection shall not be disruptive to the business of the Obligors.

                Section 5.6.    Compliance with Laws, Etc. Group and the
Borrower will, and they will cause each other Obligor to, comply with all
applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders, restrictions and Governmental
Authorizations of any applicable Governmental Authority, in respect of the
conduct of the businesses of the Obligors and the ownership of their respective
properties (including, without limitation, leased airport facilities and Slots),
except such as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
except for such noncompliance as could not in any case or in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Group and the Borrower
will not, and they will not permit an other Obligor to, conduct any Hazardous
Materials Activity at any Facility or at any other location in a manner that
does not comply in all material respects with Environmental Laws. The Borrower
and Group will, and will cause each other Obligor to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all other Persons operating or occupying any of
their properties to comply in all material respects with Environmental Laws.

                Section 5.7.    Remedial Action Regarding Hazardous Materials.

                (a)     To the extent required by Environmental Laws, Group and
the Borrower will, and they will cause each Obligor to, take any and all
necessary remedial action (except to the extent that such remedial action is
taken by other Persons responsible for such remedial action through contractual
arrangements with an Obligor) in connection with the presence, storage, use,
disposal, transportation, Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous
Materials on, under or about any Facility in order to comply timely with all
applicable Environmental Laws and Governmental Authorizations except for such
non-compliance as could not in any case or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. In the event any Obligor undertakes
any remedial action with respect to any Hazardous Materials on, under or about
any Facility, Group or the Borrower will, or they will cause such Obligor to,
conduct and complete such remedial action (or will cause such action to be taken
pursuant to contractual rights of such Obligor against third parties) in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, and in accordance with the
policies, orders and directives of all federal, state and local Governmental
Authorities except when, and only to the extent that, such Obligor's liability
for such presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation or discharge of any
Hazardous Materials is being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings diligently conducted by such Obligor or except for such
non-compliance as could not in any case or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)     The Requisite Lenders or the Board may request (i) from
time to time, if and when such Person(s) have reason to believe that an
Environmental Claim or Release of Hazardous Materials which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect may exist at or with respect to any
Facility, and (ii) not more than once during any twelve month period for the
purpose of determining whether there is belief that an Environmental Claim or
Release of Hazardous Materials which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect exists at or with respect to any Facility, and in the
case of any such request, the Borrower will provide to the Lenders and the
Board, within sixty (60) days after such request, at the expense of the
Borrower, an environmental site assessment report for any of its, or any other
Obligor's properties described in such request, prepared by

                                       61

<PAGE>

an environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to the Board evaluating
the Environmental Claim or Release of Hazardous Materials and estimating the
cost of any required compliance, removal or remedial action in connection with
the Environmental Claim or Release of Hazardous Materials. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing clause (b), if the Agent determines at any time that
a material risk exists that any such report will not be provided in the time
referred to above, the Agent may retain an environmental consulting firm to
prepare such report at the expense of the Borrower, and each of Group and the
Borrower hereby agrees to grant, and agrees to cause any other Obligor that owns
property described in such a request to grant, at the time of such request, to
the Agent, the Lenders, the Board, such firm and any agents or representatives
thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of tenants,
to enter into their respective properties to undertake such an assessment.

                Section 5.8.    Additional Obligors; Collateral.

                (a)     With reasonable promptness (and in any event within 30
days) following the formation or acquisition by any Obligor of a Subsidiary or
of any Capital Stock of any other Person, the Borrower (i) shall provide the
Agent, the Loan Administrator and the Board the name, corporate structure and
allocation of Voting Stock and equity interests of such Subsidiary or other
Person, (ii) in the case of any such Subsidiary that is not a CFC, shall cause
such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Agent and the Board a Subsidiary
Joinder in the form of Exhibit P hereto, pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall
become a party to this Agreement, and (iii) shall deliver to the Agent and the
Board documents of the types referred to in clauses (a)(viii), (ix) and (x) of
Article III, all in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Agent
and the Board.

                (b)     Each of Group and the Borrower will, and they will cause
each other Obligor (including, without limitation, each Obligor created or
acquired after the Closing Date) to, cause all of its properties and assets as
of the Closing Date and all properties and assets acquired after the Closing
Date (including, without limitation, the Capital Stock of each Subsidiary
created or acquired and the Capital Stock of each other Person acquired after
the Closing Date, and all of its leases of airport facilities) other than
Excluded Property to be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the
Obligations.

                (c)     The Borrower shall obtain one or more Appraisal Reports
establishing the value of the Appraised Collateral, the Slots and the Gate
Leases as of (i) the last day of each Fiscal Year beginning December 31, 2003,
(ii) the date upon which any additional property or assets that constitutes
Appraised Collateral is pledged as Collateral to the Collateral Agent pursuant
to Section 5.8(d) to secure the Obligations, but only with respect to such
additional Collateral and (iii) no more than once during any twelve (12) month
period, a date which is no later than 60 days after the Board (or if the Board
Guaranty shall have terminated, the Requisite Lenders) has requested that the
Borrower obtain an Appraisal Report (it being understood that the obligation
herein of the Borrower to periodically obtain Appraisal Reports shall be in
addition to any rights or obligations under the Collateral Documents). Such
Appraisal Reports may be based on desktop appraisals unless the Board (or if the
Board Guaranty shall have terminated, the Requisite Lenders) shall have
requested that an Appraisal Report be based on physical inspection.

                (d)     If as of the end of any fiscal quarter commencing on or
after April 1, 2004 (each such date a "Collateral Value Test Date") there exists
a Collateral Value Deficiency, the Borrower shall do one of the following to the
extent (but only to the extent) necessary to eliminate such Collateral Value
Deficiency: (i) prepay the Loan in an amount equal to Group's Adjusted Excess
Cash Flow for the period commencing on April 1, 2003 and ending on such
Collateral Value Test Date (which payment shall be made on the Interest Payment
Date first occurring after delivery of the Collateral Value Certificate that
evidences such Collateral Value Deficiency); (ii) pledge additional Eligible
Collateral to the Collateral Agent pursuant to a Collateral Document Supplement
or other Collateral Document, in each case on terms and conditions as are
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, the Board and the Collateral Agent, or

                                       62

<PAGE>

(iii) prepay the Loan as provided in clause (i) above and pledge additional
Eligible Collateral as provided in clause (ii) above; provided, that if Group's
Adjusted Excess Cash Flow for period, together with all Eligible Collateral that
is available to be pledged is not sufficient to eliminate such Collateral Value
Deficiency, the Borrower shall continue to prepay the Loan in an amount equal to
Group's Adjusted Excess Cash Flow for the period commencing on April 1, 2003 and
ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter following the Collateral Value
Test Date as of which the Collateral Value Deficiency was established (which
payments shall be made on the Interest Payment Dates respectively relating to
the Interest Periods first occurring after each such fiscal quarter) and pledge
all additional Eligible Collateral to the Collateral Agent as it becomes
available until the Collateral Value Deficiency no longer exists (whether as a
result of prepayments of the Loan, pledge of additional collateral, or increase
in collateral value or any combination of the foregoing), and provided, further,
that (A) if any cash which is used to purchase Aircraft Related Equipment is
deducted from Consolidated EBITDAR in computing the amount of Excess Cash Flow
for any period during the existence of a Collateral Value Deficiency, the
Aircraft Related Equipment purchased with such cash shall be pledged pursuant to
clause (ii) above, unless it is required to be pledged to a Lender of purchase
money financing therefor, and (B) if the Borrower subsequently enters into an
agreement to sell any Aircraft Related Equipment pledged to the Collateral Agent
under clause (A) of this proviso as part of a sale-leaseback transaction of the
type excepted from the definition of Asset Sale or finance such Aircraft Related
Equipment within twelve months of acquisition thereof, the Board, or if the
Board Guaranty is no longer in effect, the Requisite Lenders shall instruct the
Collateral Agent to release the Lien so granted.

                (e)     If additional Collateral is being pledged in accordance
with Section 5.8(b) or (d), such additional Collateral shall be free and clear
of any Liens (other than as permitted under the applicable Collateral Document)
and the pledgor(s) shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such
applicable Collateral Document Supplements or Collateral Documents (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the Board) necessary to grant
to the Collateral Agent and shall take all other actions (as are in the
reasonable judgment of the Collateral Agent and the Board) necessary or
desirable to cause the Liens created thereby to be perfected first priority
Liens protected under applicable law (except as otherwise provided under the
applicable Collateral Document), shall if requested by the Board, or if the
Board Guaranty is no longer in effect, the Requisite Lenders, furnish favorable
legal opinions to the Collateral Agent with respect to such additional
Collateral, including the perfection and priority of the Collateral Agent's Lien
thereon and evidence of applicable filings to the Loan Administrator, and shall
otherwise comply with the provisions of the applicable Collateral Documents that
apply to a pledge of such Collateral.

                (f)     In connection with each prepayment or pledge of
additional Eligible Collateral pursuant to Section 5.8(d) above, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Collateral Agent, the Loan Administrator and the Board
either (i) a Collateral Value Certificate which establishes that the applicable
Collateral Value Deficiency no longer exists, or (ii) an Officer's Certificate
of Group that certifies (A) the amount of Group's Excess Cash Flow since the
Closing Date, and (B) that Group has identified to the Collateral Agent and the
Board all of its material property (other than Excluded Property) that is not
subject to a Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent under a Collateral Document.

                (g)     Group and the Borrower will, and they will cause each
other Obligor to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the
Gate Leases at the airports identified on Schedule 5.8(g), as well as each
renewal, extension or replacement thereof, to be pledged to the Collateral Agent
to secure the Obligations, each such pledge to be on such terms and conditions,
and with such limitations, as may be required by the relevant airport authority
and are reasonably acceptable to the Board or, if the Board Guarantee is no
longer in full force and effect, the Requisite Lenders; provided that the
Obligors shall have no further obligation under this sentence after the first
anniversary of the Closing Date. With respect to Gate Leases existing on the
Closing Date, upon receipt by the Borrower of a written

                                       63

confirmation from the Board or, as the case may be, the Agent on behalf of the
Requisite Lenders, that the pledge of the Gate Leases at an airport listed on
Schedule 5.8(g) (including any certifications, opinions and filings as may
reasonably be requested in connection therewith) is acceptable, which
confirmation shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Initial Unrestricted Cash
Reserve required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.4(a)
shall be reduced by the Dollar amount set out on Schedule 5.8(g) for such
airport.

                (h)     Any partial prepayment of the Loan under Section 5.8(d)
shall be applied to the then remaining installments of the outstanding principal
amount of the Loan (ratably as to Tranche A and Tranche B in the inverse order
of maturity). Any such prepayment shall be paid to the Agent for application as
provided in Section 2.9.

                Section 5.9.    Employee Benefit Plans. Group and the Borrower
will, and they will cause each other Obligor to, ensure that the Plans and
Multiemployer Plans with respect to which the Obligors may have any liability
are operated in compliance with all applicable laws, except to the extent that
the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                Section 5.10.   FAA Matters; Citizenship. The Borrower shall at
all times hereunder be an "air carrier" within the meaning of the Act and hold a

the issuance of the Board Guaranty, and shall promptly furnish the Board, the
Loan Administrator and the Agent all such information as may be reasonably
requested by the Board, the Loan Administrator or the Agent in connection with
the Board Guaranty. The Borrower and Group will, and will cause each other
Obligor to, execute such documents and take such actions in furtherance of its
obligations under the Act and the Regulations as the Board, the Loan
Administrator or the Agent may request.

                Section 5.12.   Audits and Reviews. The Borrower and Group will,

conduct of, such audits and reviews during the period the Loan is outstanding
and for three (3) years thereafter, as the Board may deem appropriate, by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Board or the United States Comptroller
General. To the extent requested by the Board or the Loan Administrator, the
Borrower and Group will, and they will cause each other Obligor to, provide
reasonable access to the officers and employees, books, records, accounts,
documents, correspondence, and other information of the Obligors, financial
advisors, consultants and independent certified accountants that the Board or
the United States Comptroller General considers necessary.

                Section 5.13.   Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will apply the
proceeds from the Loan for such general corporate purposes as are permissible
under the Act and Regulations, and not for prepayment or refinancing of any
Indebtedness of the Obligors for borrowed money (other than payments of amounts
owed by the Obligors under the DIP Loan Facility or of amounts required to be
paid to lenders or lessors to cure defaults existing on the Closing Date under
aircraft financing transactions that are the subject of term sheets listed as
Specified Contracts on Schedule 4.15(a)) nor for the acquisition of the stock,
or of all or any substantial part of the assets, of any Person. No portion of

violates Regulations T, U, or X of the

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such
Board of Governors or to violate Section 7(c) of the Exchange Act.

                Section 5.14.   Lower-Tier Covered Transaction. In the event

is defined in 31 C.F.R. Section 19.110, as amended or modified from time to time
and not excepted therefrom by 31 C.F.R. Section 19.200(c)) in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereunder, the Borrower and Group will, and they will
cause each other Obligor to, include the clause entitled "Certificate Regarding
Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier
Covered Transactions" as set forth in Appendix B to Part 19 of title 31 of the
C.F.R. in such lower-tier covered transaction and the Borrower and Group will,
and they will cause each other Obligor to, obtain a certification from the other
Person or Persons party to such lower-tier covered transaction to the effect
that each such other Person (and each "principal" thereof, as such term is
defined in 31 C.F.R. Section 19.105, as amended or modified from time to time)
is not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in such transaction by
any Federal department or agency, or an explanation why such Person is unable to
so certify. Further, neither Group nor the Borrower will, and they will cause
each other Obligor not to, enter into a lower-tier covered transaction with a
Person who has been proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R. Section 9.4, debarred
or suspended unless granted an exception for such lower-tier covered transaction
pursuant to 31 C.F.R. Section 19.215.

                Section 5.15.   Contractual Obligations.

                (a)     Each of Group and the Borrower will, and will cause each
other Obligor to, perform, observe or fulfill the obligations, covenants and
conditions contained in each of its Contractual Obligations (including the
Specified Contracts), provided that a failure to so perform, observe or fulfill
such obligations, covenants and conditions that (i) could not (either
individually or in the aggregate) reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) does not preclude continued operations by the Obligors at
any of the airport terminals listed on Schedule 4.21 shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 5.15(a).

                (b)     The Obligors (i) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the final definitive documentation for each of the Specified
Contracts that are identified on Schedule 4.15(a) as being in term sheet form,
which final documentation shall be provided in the applicable term sheet and
reflect the applicable Concession Value described in the Application and
summarized on Schedule 4.15(b), to be executed and delivered by the applicable
parties thereto no later than June 30, 2003, and (ii) shall make copies of such
final documentation available to the Board and otherwise shall keep the Board
informed of the status of the documentation for such Specified Contracts;
provided that this Section 5.15(b) shall not apply with respect to any such
Specified Contract that is related to a financing transaction that is rejected
by an Obligor in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.

                Section 5.16.   Slot Utilization. Each Obligor holding or
operating Slots shall utilize its Slots in a manner consistent with the Slot
Regulations so as to avoid the withdrawal of any Slot by the FAA or other
revocation or termination for failure to comply with the Slot Regulations,
taking into account any waivers or other relief granted by the FAA or otherwise
under the Slot Regulations; provided, however, that the Obligors shall not be
required to so utilize Secondary Slots to the extent the Obligors determine that
such Secondary Slots are no longer commercially required. The Obligors shall
maintain personnel, policies, procedures and a computer database for the
monitoring, utilization and management of the Slots in compliance with the Slot
Regulations so as to ensure, to the greatest extent operationally feasible, that
no Slot becomes subject to withdrawal by the FAA or is otherwise revoked or
terminated based upon the failure to comply with the Slot Regulations.

Administrator or the Agent may reasonably request in order to effect fully the
purposes of the Loan Documents and to maintain and ensure the validity,

Aircraft Related Equipment, neither Group nor the Borrower will, and they will
not permit any other Obligor to, directly or indirectly, become liable after the
Closing Date as lessee or as a guarantor or other surety with respect to any
lease, whether an Operating Lease or a Capital Lease, of any property (whether
real, personal or mixed), whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in each case
which (i) an Obligor has sold or transferred or is to sell or transfer to any
other Person (other than another Obligor) or (ii) an Obligor intends to use for
substantially the same purpose as any other property which has been or is to be
sold or transferred by Group, the Borrower or such Obligor to any Person (other
than another Obligor) in connection with such lease; provided that after the

Transaction"), other than (x) Affiliate Transactions permitted under Section

provided that if an Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involves or has a value in excess of $10,000,000, such Obligor
shall not enter into such Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliate
Transactions unless a majority of the disinterested members of the board of
directors of Group shall reasonably and in good faith determine that such
Affiliate Transaction is fair and reasonable to such Obligor or is on terms no
less favorable to such Obligor than those that might reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party. For purposes of this Section
6.7, (i) Section 11.9 notwithstanding, the determination of whether a
transaction is "fair" shall be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law,
including decisional law thereunder, and (ii) a member of the Board of Directors
of Group shall not be deemed to be "interested" in an related Affiliate
Transaction solely by virtue of such member's nomination for such membership by
the Affiliate which is party to such Affiliate Transaction or by the holder of
5% or more of a class of an Obligor's Capital Stock which is party or whose
Affiliate is party to such Affiliate Transaction.

                (b)     The provisions of Section 6.7(a) shall not apply to (i)

Limited LLC, as determined by the board of directors of such Obligor or the
senior management of the Borrower or Group in good faith; (iv) any Restricted
Payments permitted by Section 6.3; (v) transactions contemplated by the

Borrower, (I) the outstanding principal amount of the Loan at the time the
transaction is consummated does not exceed $500,000,000 and (II) the Borrower is
the surviving entity or if the Borrower is not the surviving entity, such
surviving entity or the Person that acquires by conveyance, lease or transfer
the properties and assets of the Borrower substantially as an entirety, shall be
a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of
America or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and can make the
representations contained in Section 4.1(b), and shall expressly assume, by an
agreement executed and delivered to the Agent and the Board in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent and the Board, Borrower's obligations to repay the
Loan and all other obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents, or (b)
in the case of a consolidation or merger involving Group, Group is the surviving
entity or if Group is not the surviving entity, such surviving entity or the
Person that acquires by conveyance, lease or transfer the properties and assets
of Group substantially as an entirety, shall be a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof or

Agent and the Board, all of Group's obligations under each Loan Document to
which it is a party; (ii) immediately before and after giving effect to such
transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and immediately after giving effect to such transaction, Group or if

precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied
with and addressing such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the
Board and the Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.9, (i) any Obligor may merge or consolidate with any other Obligor,
provided, that in the case of each such merger or consolidation involving Group
and/or the Borrower, Group and/or the Borrower (as applicable) shall be the
continuing or surviving Person and (ii) any Obligor (other than Group or the
Borrower) may convey, lease or transfer its properties and assets substantially
as an entirety to any other Obligor.

                Section 6.10.   Limitations on Amendments.

                (a)     No Obligor shall amend, waive or modify, nor shall it
consent to or request any amendment, waiver or modification, of any of the
material terms, conditions, representations and covenants contained in any
Indebtedness for borrowed money that (i) shortens the final maturity date of
such Indebtedness (without giving effect to any amendment, waiver or
modification, the "Initial Indebtedness"; and after giving effect to any such
amendment, waiver or modification, the "Amended

                                       72

<PAGE>

Indebtedness") and (ii) requires the acceleration of the final scheduled
maturity date and/or any principal payments, including but not limited to
scheduled payments and mandatory prepayments, and/or increases the principal
amount payable on any date (including, without limitation, pursuant to mandatory
prepayments) prior to the dates of analogous payments of such Initial
Indebtedness; provided, that the consummation by the Obligors of the
transactions contemplated by any Specified Contract referenced on Schedule
4.15(a) shall not constitute a breach of this Section 6.10.

                (b) (i) No Obligor shall agree to any amendment, waiver,
modification or early termination of any Specified Contract (A) if the Amendment
Cost associated with such amendment, waiver, modification or termination (1)
together with the aggregate Amendment Costs of all other amendments, waivers or
modifications of such Specified Contract effected during the same calendar year,
would exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate, or (2) together with the aggregate
Amendment Costs of all other amendments, waivers, modifications or terminations
of all Specified Contracts effected during the same calendar year, would exceed
$5,000,000 in the aggregate, provided that, an Obligor's exercise of any right
to match a higher rental rate that is offered by a third party to lease aircraft
under a lease that is a Specified Contract, but which by its terms, may be
re-bid by the lessor, shall not constitute a violation of this clause (i)(A),
and (B) unless it is beneficial to the Obligors and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, all as determined in good faith by
the Borrower. In addition, no Obligor shall take any other action, including any
failure to comply with any Specified Contract which failure could give rise to
the right of any third party to terminate such Specified Contract prior to its
scheduled termination date, that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Obligors' ability to realize the aggregate Concession Values that the
Obligors are scheduled to realize from the Specified Contracts except to the
extent permitted in clause (A) above.

                (ii)    In connection with any amendment, waiver or modification
        to the Specified Contracts which is permitted in accordance with
        subsection (b)(i) above, the Borrower shall provide the Board with an
        Officer's Certificate certifying that such amendment, waiver or
        modification complies with the conditions of such clause (i).

                (c)     Group and the Borrower will not, and they will not
permit any other Obligor to, amend, adopt or terminate any Plan (i) unless such
action could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or
(ii) in any manner that could reasonably be expected to give the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation a sound and just basis to commence Proceedings against the
Obligors on the basis that such action constitutes a subsequent change in
connection with the Obligor's termination or replacement of the defined benefit
Retirement Income Plan for Pilots of US Airways, Inc. with the 2003 Pilots
Defined Contribution Plan.

                Section 6.11.   No Further Negative Pledges. Except with respect
to (a) specific property encumbered to secure payment of particular Indebtedness
or to be sold pursuant to an executed agreement with respect to a permitted
asset sale (including sale and leaseback transactions not prohibited by this
Agreement) and (b) restrictions by reason of customary provisions restricting
pledges, Liens, assignments, subletting or other transfers contained in leases,
licenses and similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business
(provided that such restrictions are limited to the property or assets secured
by such Liens or the property or assets subject to such leases, licenses or
similar agreements, as the case may be), after the date hereof neither Group nor
the Borrower will, and they will not permit any other Obligor to, enter into any
agreement prohibiting the creation or assumption of any Lien to secure the
Obligations upon any of its properties or assets, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired.

                Section 6.12.   Speculative Transactions. Neither Group nor the
Borrower will, and they will not permit any other Obligor to, become a general
partner in any general or limited partnership or joint venture engaged or
involved in, nor will either Group or the Borrower, or will they permit any

                                       73

<PAGE>

other Obligor to, engage in any transaction involving, commodity options or
future contracts or any similar speculative transactions; provided, however,
that the following transactions shall not be prohibited by this Section 6.12:
(i) transactions designed to hedge against fluctuations in fuel costs, entered
into in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past business practice
or then current industry practice, and not entered into for speculative
purposes, (ii) transactions designed to hedge interest rates entered into with
respect to notional amounts not to exceed actual or anticipated Indebtedness,
not entered into for speculative purposes and (iii) transactions designed to
hedge against risks associated with fluctuations in currencies entered into in
the ordinary course of business.

                Section 6.13.   Asset Sales. Neither Group nor the Borrower
will, and they will not permit any other Obligor to, directly or indirectly,
consummate any Asset Sale unless (i) the consideration received in respect of
such Asset Sale is at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets subject
to such Asset Sale and (ii) at least 85% of the value of the consideration
received by such Obligor in respect of such Asset Sale is in the form of any
combination of the following: (A) cash or Cash Equivalents, (B) Aircraft Related
Equipment or other assets to be owned by and used in the business of an Obligor
or (C) the assumption by the Person acquiring the assets in such Asset Sale of
Indebtedness or Trade Payables of the Obligors with the effect that the Obligors
will no longer have any obligation with respect to such Indebtedness or Trade
Payables.

                Section 6.14.   Going Private Transactions. After the
effectiveness of the listing contemplated by Section 5.17, neither Group nor any
other Obligor shall redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any Capital Stock of
Group, or otherwise engage or participate in any "Rule 13e-3 transaction" (as
defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act) or similar transaction, or agree
to engage in or commence any such transaction, except in any such case, pursuant
to any agreement that provides for or is conditioned upon payment in full in
cash of all Obligations; provided, that this Section 6.14 shall not apply to any
involuntary delisting of the Common Stock of the Borrower from the New York
Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange (as defined in the
Exchange Act), other than any such delisting that occurs in connection with a
transaction otherwise prohibited by this Section 6.14.

shall equal or exceed $25,000,000 or (ii) fails to duly observe, perform or
comply with any agreement with any Person or any term or condition of any

or exceeds $25,000,000; provided, that the failure by an Obligor to make one or
more payments that are attributable to and relate solely to return conditions

such payments; or

Board or the Tranche B Lenders holding at least twenty-five percent (25%) of
principal amount of then

                                       77

<PAGE>

outstanding Tranche B, or (ii) if the Board Guaranty is no longer in full force
and effect, the Requisite Lenders, in each case by notice to the Borrower (with

due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; provided,
however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in clause (f)
or (g) of Section 7.1, the Loan, all such interest and all such amounts and
Obligations shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable,

in connection with its exercise of remedies or forbearance from such exercise in
connection with any Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) of
Section 7.1, the Board will make itself reasonably available to consult in good
faith with the Tranche B Lenders for the purpose of obtaining their view on the
actions that may be taken in connection with such Event of Default and the
exercise of remedies or forbearance, it being understood that exercise of such
remedies or forbearance nonetheless shall remain within the sole discretion of
the Board.

        sub-servicer reasonably acceptable to the Requesting Party to provide
        these services, in which event, the Loan Administrator shall not be in
        default of its obligations hereunder (x) if the sub-servicer fails to
        comply with its obligations to provide the quarterly financial reports
        or indicative credit rating described herein so long as the Loan
        Administrator had exercised reasonable care and good faith in providing
        the financial statements to the sub-servicer and attempting to procure
        the report or indicative credit rating on behalf of the Requesting Party

        specific questions from the Requesting Party regarding such Person's
        financial condition and ability to perform its respective obligations
        under the other Loan Documents;

                (ix)    at the direction and expense of the Requesting Party,

        reports or certificates, notices, appraisals or other communications
        delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder;

                                       79

<PAGE>

                (xii)   based on certificates, notices, appraisals or other
        communications delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder,
        monitor their compliance with covenants and agreements relating to

                (xv)    subject to subsection (c) below, at the expense of the
        Requesting Party, take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
        in writing by the Requesting Party in respect of the Loan and the Loan
        Documents, such actions to be upon such terms and conditions as shall be
        mutually agreed to by the Requesting Party and the Loan Administrator.

                (c)     Limitation of Loan Administrator Duties. With respect to
the Loan Administrator's responsibilities under Section 8.1(b), the Loan
Administrator shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Loan
Administrator to liability or which is not required by this Agreement, any other
Loan Document, the Board Guaranty or applicable law. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Loan Administrator shall not give rise to any implied
duties or fiduciary obligations of the Loan Administrator to any Requesting
Party or any other Person. The Board hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
failure of the Loan Administrator to perform any of its obligations hereunder
shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the Board Guaranty.

                (d)     No Assignment of Duties. Except as permitted by clause
(iv) of Section 8.1(b), the Loan Administrator shall not be permitted to assign
any of its obligations hereunder, enter into sub-servicing agreements or
otherwise delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Requisite Lenders and the Board (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). The Loan Administrator hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the fees payable to any sub-servicer retained by it in accordance with this
Agreement shall be paid out of the fees payable by the Borrower to the Loan
Administrator under Section 2.8(b), and the Borrower acknowledges and agrees
that it shall reimburse the Loan Administrator for reasonable expenses of such
sub-servicer.

                (e)     Reliance on Experts, etc. The Loan Administrator may
retain legal counsel (including counsel for the Loan Administrator), independent
public accountants and other experts or advisers as desirable to provide the
services set forth in Section 8.1(b), and shall be reimbursed by the Borrower
for the reasonable associated costs and such other reasonable expenses as the
Loan Administrator shall incur in providing such services, except that the
Requesting Party shall reimburse the Loan Administrator for such reasonable
costs and expenses with respect to the services set forth in clauses (ix), (xiv)
and (xv) of Section 8.1(b) if requested by such Requesting Party.

                (f)     Additional Compensation. In the event that any of the
Lenders or the Board shall request that the Loan Administrator provide
additional services to it under clauses (vii), (viii), (ix), (xiv) or (xv) of
Section 8.1(b) or which are otherwise outside the scope of the services to be
provided by the Loan Administrator hereunder, the Loan Administrator shall, to
the extent it agrees to provide such additional services to such party, be
entitled to charge such party additional fees calculated in the manner set forth
on Schedule 2.8(b); provided that the Borrower shall be responsible for all such
additional fees in

                                       80

<PAGE>

connection with services under clauses (vii) and (viii) of Section 8.1(b).
Unless otherwise agreed to by such Person and the Loan Administrator, the terms
and conditions of this Article VIII shall apply to the provision by the Loan
Administrator of such additional services to such Party.

                Section 8.2.    Loan Administrator's Reliance.

                (a)     Reliance Generally. The Loan Administrator shall be
entitled to rely upon any note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, teletype message, facsimile transmission, statement, order or other
document in good faith believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by the proper person or persons and, in respect of legal matters,
upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Loan Administrator.

                (b)     Exculpation. Neither the Loan Administrator nor any of
its directors, officers, agents, employees or its sub-servicer shall be liable
to any Lender or the Board for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or
by such directors, officers, agents or employees under or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the
foregoing, the Loan Administrator: (i) may consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable to any Lender or the Board for any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such experts; (ii) except as
provided in Section 8.1, shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as
to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document on the part of Group or the
Borrower or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any
Obligor; (iii) except as otherwise provided in this Article VIII, shall not be
responsible to any Lender or the Board for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement,
the Notes or any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant thereto; and (iv) shall incur no liability under or in
respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document by acting upon
any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telegram, facsimile transmission, cable or telex) in good faith believed by it
to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

                (c)     Limitation on Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LOAN
ADMINISTRATOR, ITS EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS OR ITS SUB-SERVICER BE
LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR LOSSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS
AND OPPORTUNITY COSTS). THE LENDERS AND THE BOARD AGREE THAT THE LOAN
ADMINISTRATOR, ITS EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS AND ITS SUB-SERVICER
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE LENDERS OR THE BOARD FOR ANY ACTIONS, DAMAGES,
CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, COSTS, EXPENSES OR LOSSES IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF SERVICES HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT FOR AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE FEES THEREFOR PAID
BY THE LENDERS AND THE BOARD TO THE LOAN ADMINISTRATOR IN PERFORMING THE
SERVICES DESCRIBED HEREIN. NO TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT
SHALL BENEFIT OR CREATE ANY RIGHT OR CAUSE OF ACTION IN OR ON BEHALF OF ANY
PERSON OR ENTITY OTHER THAN THE LENDERS AND THE BOARD. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SUBSECTION ((SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, DAMAGE, CLAIM,
LIABILITY, COST, EXPENSE, OR LOSS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE.

                                       81

<PAGE>

                Section 8.3.    Indemnification. The Borrower and each
Requesting Party (other than the Board) agrees to indemnify the Loan
Administrator and its directors, officers, employees, advisors, sub-servicer and
representatives from and against any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses (excluding Taxes other than Indemnified Taxes) which may be
incurred by or asserted or awarded against the Loan Administrator in any way
relating to or arising out of the services provided by the Loan Administrator on
behalf of and at the request of such Requesting Party in connection with this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Loan Administrator under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or both on behalf of and at the request of
such Requesting Party; provided, that neither the Borrower nor any Requesting
Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Loan Administrator's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the foregoing, and to the extent that the Loan
Administrator is not reimbursed therefor by the Borrower under any Loan
Document, any Requesting Party requesting the Loan Administrator to take any
action hereunder on its behalf agrees to reimburse the Loan Administrator
promptly upon demand (but in all events within 30 days after written request)
for any and all fees of the Loan Administrator, reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Loan Administrator in
connection with the performance of the requested services requested by such
Requesting Party hereunder and under the Loan Documents. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence regarding reimbursement, in no event shall the Board be
obligated to indemnify the Loan Administrator or any of its directors, officers,
employees, advisors, representatives or any other party under any circumstances.

                Section 8.4.    Successor Loan Administrator. The Loan
Administrator may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days prior written
notice thereof to the Lenders, the Borrower and the Board and may be removed at
any time with or without cause by the Requisite Lenders and the Board; provided,
however, that the Loan Administrator shall continue to perform all Loan
Administrator functions hereunder until a successor Loan Administrator shall
have been appointed. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Loan Administrator, subject to
confirmation by the Board and the approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, by
the Borrower. If no successor Loan Administrator shall have accepted such
appointment or the applicable parties are unable to agree on a Loan
Administrator, within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the retiring Loan
Administrator's giving of notice of resignation or the removal of the Loan
Administrator, the Loan Administrator may appoint a successor Loan Administrator
who shall be willing to accept such appointment. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Loan Administrator hereunder by a successor Loan Administrator,
such successor Loan Administrator shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed
Loan Administrator, and the retiring or removed Loan Administrator shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations as Loan Administrator under this
Agreement. After any Loan Administrator's resignation or removal hereunder as
Loan Administrator the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Loan
Administrator under this Agreement.

                Section 8.5.    Conflict of Interest.

                (a)     The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) in
addition to serving as Loan Administrator under this Agreement, the Loan
Administrator may at any time and from time to time service, manage or enter
into other commercial arrangements with the Agent, any Lender, the Board or any
Supplemental Guarantor (each a "Loan Administrator Relationship"); (ii) in the
course of conducting such activities or the services to be provided by it
hereunder, or both, the Loan Administrator may from time to time have conflicts
of interest by virtue of a Loan Administrator Relationship; and (iii) the
parties hereto expressly recognize that such conflicts of interest may arise, do
hereby waive such conflicts and agree that when such conflicts of interest arise
the Loan Administrator shall perform the services to be provided by it hereunder
in a professional, diligent and workmanlike fashion; provided that nothing in

                                       82

<PAGE>

this Section 8.5 shall excuse or waive any obligations of the Loan Administrator
pursuant to Section 11.16. The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that
the Loan Administrator, in its capacity as Loan Administrator, is not acting as
an Affiliate of any of the parties hereto, and the performance of the Loan
Administrator's obligations hereunder shall not affect any right or remedy which
the Agent, any Lender or any participant may have under any Loan Document, any
participation or the Board Guaranty. Each Requesting Party expressly
acknowledges and agrees that at all times it shall take such action or omit to
take such action hereunder based on its own independent analysis of the relevant
transaction and attendant facts and circumstances.

                (b)     Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if
in connection with the provision of services, a conflict of interest shall exist
that, in the good faith opinion of the Loan Administrator, requires an
arm's-length negotiation between the Loan Administrator, on the one hand, and
any Person with a Loan Administrator Relationship, on the other hand, and the
Loan Administrator believes it would not be appropriate for the Loan
Administrator to act on behalf of the Requesting Party in connection with such
matter, then the Loan Administrator shall withdraw from acting as Loan
Administrator in connection with the matter giving rise to such conflict of
interest by giving written notice to the Requesting Party and the Borrower not
more than ten (10) Business Days after it has made such determination. In such
event, the Requesting Party shall be entitled to appoint an independent
representative to act on its behalf and at its expense for purposes of the
matter giving rise to such conflict of interest, and the Loan Administrator
shall have no responsibility or liability to the Requesting Party with respect
to such matter. During the period of such independent representative's
appointment, the Loan Administrator shall continue to perform its ordinary
functions as Loan Administrator to the extent that the performance of the Loan
Administrator does not, in the reasonable opinion of the Requesting Party,
directly or indirectly affect the matter giving rise to the conflict of
interest.

Governmental Authority, regulatory body or other Person is required for the due
authorization, execution, delivery or performance by it of this Agreement;

                (d)     this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
it and constitutes a legal and binding obligation of it, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws now or hereinafter in effect, relating to the enforcement of creditors'
rights in general and except as such enforceability may be limited by general
principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity);

                (e)     the execution, delivery and performance by it of this
Agreement does not violate any provision of any existing law or regulation or
any material agreement to which it is subject or to which it is a party or

                (f)     it has all power and governmental licenses,
authorizations, and consents and approvals required to carry on its business as

ability to perform its duties under this Agreement; and

                (g)     it will maintain and implement administrative and
operating procedures, and keep and maintain all documents, books, computer

                                   ARTICLE IX

                       THE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

                The parties hereto agree as follows:

                Section 9.1.    Authorization and Action. Each Lender and the
Board hereby appoints and authorizes each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent
to take such action as administrative agent and collateral agent, respectively,
on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents as are delegated by such Lender to it as Agent or Collateral
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, and each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent
hereby accepts such authorization and appointment. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or
provided for with specific reference to this Section 9.1 (including, without
limitation, enforcement or collection of any Note), neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be required to act
or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from action) upon the instructions of the Board or, if the Board
Guaranty is no longer in full force and effect, the Requisite Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and the Board; provided, however,
that neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be required to take any
action which exposes either the Agent or the Collateral Agent to liability or
which is contrary to this Agreement, the Board Guaranty, any other Loan Document
or applicable law. As to any provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document under which action may be taken or approval given by less than all of
the Lenders or the Board or both, as the case may be, the action taken or
approval given by the required Lenders or the Board or both, as the case may be,
shall be binding upon all Lenders and the Board to the same extent and with the
same effect as if each Lender and the Board had joined therein. Each of the
Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any note, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, teletype message, facsimile
transmission, statement, order or other document, instrument or writing believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
person or persons and, in respect of legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel
selected by the Agent or the Collateral Agent. Each of the Agent and the
Collateral Agent may deem and treat the payee of the Notes as the owner thereof
for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Agent and the Collateral Agent.
Any request, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of the Loan shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of the
Loan. Upon any delivery of any instructions to the Collateral Agent by the
Requisite Lenders pursuant to this Agreement, the Agent shall certify to the
Collateral Agent that the Lenders delivering such instructions constitute the
Requisite Lenders under the Agreement.

                Section 9.2.    Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent nor any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the
Board for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or by such directors,
officers,

                                       84

<PAGE>

agents or employees under or in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct as actually and finally determined by a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct
(as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive) damages. Without
limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each of the Agent and the
Collateral Agent: (i) may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to any
Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board for any action taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such experts; (ii)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or,
except as expressly provided in the Board Guaranty, the Board and shall not be
responsible to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or, except as expressly
provided in the Board Guaranty, the Board for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether oral or written) made in or in connection with this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document; (iii) shall not have any duty,
and shall incur no liability for its failure, to ascertain or to inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document on the part of Group or the
Borrower or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any
Obligor; (iv) shall not be responsible to any Lender, the Loan Administrator or
the Board for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan
Document, or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (v)
shall incur no liability under or in respect to this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other
instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, facsimile transmission, cable
or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or
parties; and (vi) may deem and treat each Lender which makes a loan hereunder as
the holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all purposes hereof until
the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such
Lender, as assignor, and an eligible assignee as provided in Section 11.2.

                Section 9.3.    Affiliates. If and so long as the Agent or the
Collateral Agent shall remain a Lender, the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
other Lender and may exercise the same rights and powers under this Agreement as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent or
the Collateral Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include the Agent and the Collateral Agent, each in its
individual capacity. Unrelated to its role as Agent or Collateral Agent as set
forth herein, the Agent and the Collateral Agent and their respective Affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and
generally engage in any kind of business with, any Obligor and any Person who
may do business with or own securities of any Obligor, all as if it were not the
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.

                Section 9.4.    Representations of the Lenders and the Board.
Each Lender, the Loan Administrator and the Board's representatives have
actively engaged in the negotiation of all of the terms of this Agreement. The
Board's representatives have met with the Borrower and Group to discuss the
business, affairs, financial condition and prospects of the Obligors. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, neither
the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, to provide any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board with any
credit or other information with respect to the Borrower whether coming into its
possession as of the date of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, or to
notify any Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Board of any Default or Event
of Default except as provided in Section 9.5. This Agreement and all instruments
or documents delivered in connection with this Agreement have been reviewed and
approved by each Lender, the Loan Administrator and the Board and none of the
Lenders, the Loan Administrator or the Board has relied on the Agent (except
that the Board has relied on Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity

                                       85

<PAGE>

as a Lender, to the extent provided in the Application) or the Collateral Agent
as to any legal or factual matter in connection therewith or in connection with
the transactions contemplated thereunder.

                Section 9.5.    Events of Default; Termination of Board
Guaranty.

                (a)     In the event of the occurrence of any Default or Event
of Default, any Lender or the Board knowing of such event may (but shall have no
duty to), or the Borrower or Group pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(vi) hereof shall,
give the Agent and the Collateral Agent written notice specifying such Default
or Event of Default and expressly stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". Neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have
knowledge of such events unless the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, has received such notice or, with respect to the Agent only, unless
the Default or Event of Default consists of a failure of payment of principal or
interest on the Loan. In the event that the Agent or the Collateral Agent
receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, the
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall give written notice thereof
to the Lenders, the Board and the Loan Administrator. In the event that such
notice is a notice of an Event of Default or such Default matures into an Event
of Default, the Agent and the Collateral Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed in
writing by the Board, the Tranche B Lenders or the Lenders, as provided in
Section 7.2; provided, however, that, unless and until the Agent or the
Collateral Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent and the
Collateral Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable and in the best interest of the Lenders and
the Board.

                (b)     In the event the Agent or the Collateral Agent shall
receive written notice from the Board to the effect that (i) the Board has the
right to terminate the Board Guaranty under Sections 2.04 and 2.05 thereof, (ii)
any portion of the Board Guaranty has terminated under Section 2.03 thereof or
otherwise or (iii) the Board Guaranty shall for any reason have ceased to be in
full force and effect or the Board shall have asserted that any of its
obligations thereunder is invalid or unenforceable, the Agent or the Collateral
Agent, as applicable shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Lenders.
Neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of
any such event unless the Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, has
received such notice (except if any such event results from the failure of the
Agent or the Collateral Agent to perform any of their respective obligations
under the Board Guaranty).

                Section 9.6.    Agent's and Collateral Agent's Right to
Indemnity. Except for action expressly required of the Agent or the Collateral
Agent hereunder without instructions from any Person, the Agent and the
Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action hereunder on behalf of any Lender or the Board unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by such Lender (or, in the case of the Primary
Tranche A Lender, the KHFC Administrative Agent) or the Board, as the case may
be, against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

                Section 9.7.    Indemnification of Agent and Collateral Agent.
The Lenders hereby agree to indemnify the Agent and the Collateral Agent and all
of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, advisors and
representatives thereof (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably
as most recently in effect prior to the date indemnification is sought, from and
against any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses
which may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against the Agent or the
Collateral Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement and/or
the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or the
Collateral Agent under this Agreement and/or the other Loan Documents; provided,
however, that any such indemnification obligation in respect of any claim
against the Primary Tranche A Lender shall constitute an

                                       86

<PAGE>

indemnification obligation solely of the KHFC Administrative Agent rather than
the Primary Tranche A Lender and the Primary Tranche A Lender shall have no
indemnification obligation in respect thereof; provided, further, that no Lender
(or in the case of the Primary Tranche A Lender, the KHFC Administrative Agent)
shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Agent's or the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the
Agent and the Collateral Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred
by the Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the administration or
enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights under, this Agreement and/or
the other Loan Documents, to the extent that the Agent or the Collateral Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower.

                Section 9.8.    Successor Agent and Collateral Agent. Each of
the Agent and the Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Lenders, the Board, the Loan Administrator and the
Borrower and may be removed at any time with cause (or, following the Board's
honoring of a demand for payment in accordance with the Board Guaranty, without
cause) by the Board. Any such resignation or removal shall be effective upon
appointment and acceptance of a Successor Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, in accordance with this Section 9.8. Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Borrower shall have the right to appoint a successor agent, subject
to confirmation by the Board and the Lenders. If no successor agent shall have
accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's or
Collateral Agent's, as applicable, giving of notice of resignation or the
Board's removal of the Agent or the Collateral Agent, the Agent or the
Collateral Agent, as applicable, may, with the consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld) of the Board and the Requisite Lenders and, so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower, appoint a successor
Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, who shall be willing to accept such
appointment. Each successor agent appointed hereunder shall be a commercial bank
organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof
and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000. Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent or Collateral Agent, such successor Agent or the Collateral
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent or Collateral Agent, and
the retiring or removed Agent or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations as agent under this Agreement. After any Agent's or
Collateral Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent or Collateral
Agent, as applicable, the provisions of this Article IX shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
or Collateral Agent under this Agreement.

                Section 9.9.    Release of Liens on Collateral and Guaranty
Matters. The Lenders and the Board irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent,
at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted
to or held by the Collateral Agent under any Collateral Document and to release
any Subsidiary from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which such Subsidiary may be a party (i) upon payment in full of
all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations), (ii) that
is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any Asset
Sale that complies with Section 6.13 and with respect to which the Obligor
complies with Section 2.6(b), as applicable, (iii) to the extent release of any
Lien is otherwise permitted under this Agreement or any Collateral Document, or
(iv) subject to Section 11.1, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by
the Board, or if the Board Guaranty is no longer in effect, the Requisite
Lenders.

                                    GUARANTY

                Section 10.1.   Guaranty. Each of Group and each Subsidiary
Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, as primary
obligor and not merely as surety, guarantees the punctual payment when due,
whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by
acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all of the Obligations of each of the
other Obligors now or hereafter existing under or in respect of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications,
substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing
Obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether
for principal, interest, premium, fees, indemnification payments, contract
causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the
"Guaranteed Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Agent and the Collateral Agent solely in enforcing any rights under this
Guaranty or any other Loan Document.

                Section 10.2.   Guaranty Absolute. Each of Group and each
Subsidiary Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents (but after giving
effect to applicable grace periods), regardless of any law, regulation or order
now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or
the rights of the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other party with respect
thereto. The Obligations of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor under this
Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations
of any other Obligor under the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against Group or such Subsidiary Guarantor to
enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any
other Obligor or whether any other Obligor is joined in any such action or
actions. The liability of each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of, and
Group and such Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it
may now or hereafter have in-any way relating to, any and all of the following:

                (a)     any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan
Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

                (b)     any change in the time, manner or place of payment of,
or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
Obligations of any Obligor under the Loan Documents, or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the
extension of additional credit to any Obligor or otherwise;

                (c)     any taking, exchange, release or nonperfection of any
Collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
departure from this Guaranty or any other guaranty, for all or any of the
Guaranteed Obligations;

                (d)     any manner of application of Collateral, or proceeds
thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or
other disposition of any Collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations
or any other Obligations of any Obligor under the Loan Documents, or any other
property and assets of any other Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries;

                (e)     any change, restructuring or termination of the
corporate structure or existence of any other Obligor or any of its
Subsidiaries;

                                       88

<PAGE>

                (f)     any failure of the Agent or the Collateral Agent to
disclose to any obligor any information relating to the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of
any other Obligor now or hereafter known to the Agent or the Collateral Agent,
as the case may be (such Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Agent or
the Collateral Agent to disclose such information);

                (g)     the failure of any other Person to execute this
Agreement or any other guarantee or agreement of the release or reduction of the
liability of any of the other Obligors or any other guarantor or surety with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or

                (h)     any other circumstance (including, without limitation,
any statute of limitations or any existence of or reliance on any representation
by the Agent or the Collateral Agent) that might otherwise constitute a defense
available to, or a discharge of, such Guarantor, any other Obligor or any other
guarantor or surety.

                This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,
as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or the
Collateral Agent or by any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any other Obligor or otherwise, all as though such payment had
not been made.

                Section 10.3.   Waivers and Acknowledgments.

                (a)     Each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance,
default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty, and any requirement that
the Agent or the Collateral Agent protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or
any property or assets subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action
against any other Obligor or any other Person or any Collateral.

                (b)     Each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
unconditionally waives any right to revoke this Guaranty, and acknowledges that
this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations,
whether existing now or in the future.

                (c)     Each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any
claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Collateral Agent
which in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects
the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification
rights of Group or such Subsidiary Guarantor or other rights to proceed against
any of the other Obligors, any other guarantor or any other Person or any
Collateral, and (ii) any defense based on any right of setoff or counterclaim
against or in respect of the Obligations of Group or such Subsidiary Guarantor
hereunder.

                (d)     Each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges
that the Agent or the Collateral Agent may, without notice to or demand upon
Group or such Subsidiary Guarantor and without affecting the liability of Group
or such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty, foreclose under any mortgage
by nonjudicial sale, and Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives any
defense to the recovery by the Agent or the Collateral Agent against Group or
such Subsidiary Guarantor of any deficiency after such nonjudicial sale and any
defense or benefits that may be afforded by applicable law.

                (e)     Each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part of the Agent or the
Collateral Agent to disclose to Group or any such Subsidiary Guarantor any
matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or

                                       89

<PAGE>

otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other
Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by such Person.

                (f)     Each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges
that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing
arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth
in Section 10.2 and this Section 10.3 are knowingly made in contemplation of
such benefits.

                Section 10.4.   Subrogation. Each of Group and each Subsidiary
Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any
rights that it may now have or may hereafter acquire against any other Obligor
or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment,
performance or enforcement of its Obligations under this Guaranty or under any
other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or the Collateral Agent against
such other Obligor or any other insider guarantor or any Collateral, whether or
not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or
common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from
such other Obligor or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in
cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security
on account of such claim, remedy or right, until such time as all of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall
have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments shall have expired or
terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the
immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest of (a) the
payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this Guaranty and (b) the Maturity Date, such amount shall
be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Collateral
Agent (in the same form as so received) and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent
(without any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to
the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty,
whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents, or to be held as Collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other
amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) Group or any
Subsidiary Guarantor shall pay to the Agent or the Collateral Agent all or any
part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and
all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in
cash and (iii) the Maturity Date shall have occurred, the Agent and the
Collateral Agent will, at such Guarantor's request and expense, execute and
deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without
representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to
such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the
payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.

                Section 10.5.   Continuing Guarantee; Assignments. This Guaranty
is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the
latest of (i) the payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and (ii) the Maturity Date,
(b) be binding upon Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor and their respective
successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
the Agent, the Lenders and the Collateral Agent and their respective successors,
transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the
immediately preceding sentence, any Lender may assign or otherwise transfer all
or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any other
Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the
benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender under this Article X or
otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 11.2. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor if such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be
a Subsidiary of Group as a result of a transaction permitted by the Loan
Documents.

                Section 10.6.   No Reliance. Each of Group and Subsidiary
Guarantor has, independently and without reliance upon the Collateral Agent, the
Agent or any Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Guaranty and each other Loan Document to which it is or is to be a party, and
each of Group and each Subsidiary Guarantor has established adequate means of
obtaining from each other Obligor on a continuing basis information pertaining
to, and is now and on a continuing basis will be completely familiar with, the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
properties and prospects of such other Obligor.

                Section 11.1.   Amendments, Waivers, Etc.

                (a)     Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor consent
to any departure by any Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and (x) so long as the Board Guaranty is in full
force and effect, signed by the Board or (y) if the Board Guaranty is no longer
in effect, signed by the Requisite Lenders, and then any such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given; provided, however, that

                (i)     no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall,
        unless in writing and signed by each Lender affected thereby, do any of
        the following:

                change the amount of or extend the date for payment of any
                principal of the Loan;

                        (3) decrease the rate of interest on the Loan or any
                fee, indemnity or other amount payable to such Lender or extend
                any date fixed for payment of such interest, indemnity or other
                amount or fees;

                        (4) amend the definition of "Requisite Lenders" or this
                Section 11.1; and

                        (5) waive, amend, modify or release the Guaranty except
                as provided herein;

                (ii)    no amendment or modification of any material provision
        of Article II, III, IV, IX or X, or Section 5.1 (other than monthly
        reporting) 5.2, 5.5, 7.1 (other than to add Events of Default), 7.2,
        11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.9, 11.10, 11.11, 11.12, 11.16, 11.17 or
        11.19 or any of the definitions as relevant thereto, and no release of
        all or substantially all of the Collateral, or any dilution or
        subordination of the Liens on any Collateral having a material value,
        shall be effective unless in writing and signed by (A) RSA so long as it
        continues to hold more than 37.5% of the principal amount of Tranche B
        Notes outstanding, (B) Bank of America, N.A., as a Tranche B Lender, so
        long as it continues to hold more than 12.5% of the principal amount of
        Tranche B Notes outstanding, and (C) Bank of America, N.A., as KHFC
        Administrative Agent or as administrative agent for any other Eligible
        BofA Conduit to which the initial Primary Tranche A Lender transfers or
        assigns its interest in the Loan, so long as the initial Primary Tranche
        A Lender or such Eligible BofA Conduit continues to hold more than 50%
        of the principal amount of Tranche A Notes; and

<PAGE>

                (iii)   no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall,
        unless in writing and signed by the Agent, the Collateral Agent or the
        Loan Administrator, as applicable, in addition to the Persons required
        above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent, the
        Collateral Agent or the Loan Administrator, as the case may be, under
        this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Board Guaranty.

                (b)     Execution of Amendments and Waivers by the Agent. The
Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the written concurrence of any
Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that
Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on
the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                (c)     Non-Consenting Lenders. In connection with any proposed
amendment, modification, waiver or termination requiring the consent of all
affected Lenders, if the consent of Requisite Lenders is obtained, but the
consent of other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such
Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this Section 11.1 being
referred to as a "Non-Consenting Lender"), then, so long as the Lender that is
acting as the Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, at the Borrower's request,
the Agent or an Eligible Lender that is acceptable to the Agent, the Board and,
so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Borrower, shall have the right with the Agent's consent and in the Agent's sole
discretion (but shall have no obligation) to purchase from such Non-Consenting
Lender, and such Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Agent's
request, sell and assign to the Lender that is acting as the Agent or such
Eligible Lender, all of the portion of the Loan of such Non-Consenting Lender
for an amount equal to the principal balance of such portion of the Loan held by
the Non-Consenting Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto
through the date of sale, such purchase and sale to be consummated pursuant to
an executed Assignment and Acceptance; provided, that such Non-Consenting Lender
shall be entitled to retain any Warrants it holds notwithstanding such sale and
assignment.

                Section 11.2.   Assignments and Participations.

                (a)     Assignment. Each Lender may sell, transfer, negotiate or
assign either in whole or in part to one or more Eligible Lenders its rights and
obligations hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents; provided
that (i) the assigning Lender shall give prompt written notice to the Agent, the
Borrower, the Board and the Loan Administrator of the terms of and the parties
to any such assignment, (ii) the proposed assignee shall provide to the Agent,
the Borrower and the Board all documentation and certificates as required by the
Agent, the Borrower and the Board to confirm to the Agent's and the Board's
satisfaction that such proposed assignee is an Eligible Lender, (iii) the
Borrower will not be obligated to pay any greater amount under Section 2.10(c)
or Section 2.12 (in respect of increased costs or Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed pursuant to applicable law in effect on the date of such
assignment) to the assignee than the Borrower is then obligated to pay to the
assigning Lender under such Sections, (iv) so long as no Event of Default
exists, the Borrower shall have consented to any assignment other than an
assignment to an Eligible BofA Conduit, a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), (v) the Agent shall have
consented to such assignment (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), and
(vi) except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2(d) and except for an
assignment by the initial primary Tranche A Lender to an Eligible BofA Conduit,
until payment in full has been made under the Board Guaranty or the Board
Guaranty shall have terminated, the Board shall have consented to such
assignment in writing (such consent, not to be unreasonably withheld).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no prior consent or approval of any Person
shall be required for an assignment of Tranche A from the Primary Tranche A
Lender to the Alternate Tranche A Lender, (ii) regardless of whether an Event of
Default exists, without the consent of the

                                       92

<PAGE>

Borrower (in its sole discretion) no right, obligation or interest hereunder or
under any Note or other Loan Document may be sold, transferred, negotiated or
assigned to (x) an airline, a commercial aircraft operator, an air freight
forwarder or an entity principally engaged in the business of parcel transport
by air (any such Person, a "Prohibited Transferee"), (y) an Affiliate of a
Prohibited Transferee or (z) a manufacturer of, or a maintenance provider for,
aircraft airframes, engines or related parts, and (iii) Bank of America, N.A. as
in its capacity as Agent (and any successor Agent appointed in accordance with
Section 9.8) shall hold at all times and shall not be entitled to assign at
least 5% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Tranche B of the Loan.
In addition to the other assignment rights provided in this Section 11.2, the
Primary Tranche A Lender may, without the prior written consent of the Borrower,
the Agent or the Board, pledge all of its rights under, interest in and title to
this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the Board Guaranty to Bank of America,
N.A., as collateral agent for the commercial paper program of the Primary
Tranche A Lender, to secure the Primary Tranche A Lender's obligations under its
commercial paper program; it being understood that any sale or other assignment
or disposition of any of such rights, interests or title, including in
connection with, or as a result of, a foreclosure or any other exercise of
remedies by Bank of America, N.A. in such capacity, or by any beneficiary of
such pledge, shall be subject to restrictions above in this Section 11.2(a).

                (b)     Deliveries in Connection with Assignment. The parties to
each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording, an Assignment and Acceptance, and the assignee, if a Non-U.S. Person,
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, on or prior to the date of the
assignment, two completed copies of IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other
applicable form, certificate or document required to satisfy the requirements of
Section 2.12. Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance and the receipt by
the Agent of an assignment fee in the amount of $10,000 (which fee shall be
payable by the Borrower), the Agent shall record such Assignment and Acceptance
and from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and
Acceptance (i) the assignee thereunder of all or any portion of the Loan shall
become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations under the
Loan Documents have been assigned to such assignee pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender and (ii) the
assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations under this
Agreement have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (except those rights with respect to indemnification which
survive the payment in full of the Obligations) and be released from its
obligations under the Loan Documents, other than those relating to events or
circumstances occurring prior to such assignment (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto).

                (c)     Agent's Duties Upon Assignment. Upon its receipt of an
Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed, (i) accept
such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in
the Register, (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and (iv) shall
give prompt written notice of the terms of and parties to any such assignment to
the Borrower, the Board and the Loan Administrator.

                (d)     Assignments to Federal Reserve Bank. In addition to the
other assignment rights provided in this Section 11.2, each Lender may assign,
without the prior consent of the Borrower, the Agent or the Board as collateral
or otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement to any Federal Reserve Bank
pursuant to Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board, provided, however, that
no such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder.

                (e)     Participations. Each Lender may, without the prior
consent of the Borrower or any other Person, sell participations, to the extent
permitted by the Regulations and except as provided in Section 5.04(b) of the
Board Guaranty, in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
hereunder and

                                       93

<PAGE>

under the Notes and the other Loan Documents (any such purchaser of a
participation being referred to as a "Participant"); provided that (i) neither
the Notes nor the Board Guaranty is assigned, conveyed, sold or transferred in
whole or in part, (ii) the Board's ability to assert any and all defenses
available to it under the Board Guaranty and the law is not adversely affected,
(iii) the Borrower will not be obligated to pay any greater amount under Section
2.10(b) or Section 2.12 (in respect of increased costs, Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes) to the Participant than the Borrower is then obligated to pay to
the selling Lender under such Sections, (iv) Bank of America, N.A., as in its
capacity as Agent (and any successor Agent appointed in accordance with Section
9.8) shall maintain and shall not participate at least 5% of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of Tranche B of the Loan and (v) no Participant
shall, without the consent of the Borrower (such consent to be in the Borrower's
sole discretion), be a (x) Prohibited Transferee, (y) an Affiliate of a
Prohibited Transferee or (z) a manufacturer of, or a maintenance provider for,
aircraft airframes, engines or related parts, without in each case the consent
of the Borrower. In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender,
(A) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged,
(B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties for the
performance of such obligations, (C) such Lender shall remain the holder of such
Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement, (D) the Borrower, the Agent, the
Board and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and (E) each Participant, shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Agent, on or prior to the date of the sale of the participation, two completed
copies of IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form, certificate
or document required to satisfy the requirements of Section 2.12. Any
Participant will be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10(c), 2.10(e), 2.11
and 2.12 to the same extent as if such Person were a Lender.

                Section 11.3.   Costs and Expenses. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Obligors agree to pay
promptly (i) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Loan
Administrator, the Board, RSA, the Lenders, the Agent and the Collateral Agent
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents, the Board Guaranty and all documents relating thereto (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses), (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Loan Administrator, the Board, RSA, the Agent and the Collateral
Agent in connection with any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications hereto (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) and (iii)
all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses
incurred by the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Loan Administrator
and the Board in enforcing any Obligations of, or in collecting any payments due
from, the Obligors hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.

                Section 11.4.   Indemnities. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Obligors agree to defend,
indemnify, pay and hold harmless the Board, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
KHFC Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Loan Administrator and their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors
(collectively called the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including without limitation the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
for such Indemnitees, but excluding Taxes), whether direct, indirect or
consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws, statutes,
rules or regulations (including without limitation securities and commercial
laws, statutes and rules or regulations), on common law or equitable cause or on
contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
any such Indemnitee, in any manner arising out of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without
limitation, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan) or any breach
or default by the Obligors of any provision of the Loan Documents or solely with
respect to the Board, any statement contained in the Application (collectively
called the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that the Obligors shall not have
any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent such

                                       94

<PAGE>

Indemnified Liabilities arise (i) from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of that Indemnitee (as actually and finally determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) and only to the
extent that such Indemnified Liabilities constitute direct (as opposed to
special, indirect, punitive or consequential) damages or (ii) constitute
ordinary and usual operating or overhead expenses of an Indemnitee (excluding,
without limitation, costs and expenses of any outside counsel, consultant or
agent). To the extent that the undertaking to defend, indemnify, pay and hold
harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is
violative of any law or public policy, each of the Obligors shall contribute the
maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to
the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the
Indemnitees or any of them. No Indemnitee shall have any liability (whether
direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to any Obligor or any of its
security holders or creditors for or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent such liability resulted from such
Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event, however, shall
any Indemnitee be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings).

                Section 11.5.   Right of Set-Off. In addition to any rights now
or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any
such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Lender is hereby
authorized by the Obligors at any time or from time to time, with notice to the
Obligors and to each other Lender, the Board, the Agent, the Collateral Agent
and the Loan Administrator, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and
all deposits (general or special) including, but not limited to, Indebtedness
evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured) and any
other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender to or for the credit
or the account of any Obligor against and on account of the obligations and
liabilities of such Obligor to that Lender under this Agreement, the Guaranty,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, all
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this
Agreement, the Guaranty, the Notes, or any other Loan Document, irrespective of
whether or not (i) that Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (ii) the
principal of or the interest on the Loan or any other amounts due hereunder
shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 7.2 and although said
obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

                Section 11.6.   Sharing of Payments, Etc. The Lenders and the
Board hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall, whether by
voluntary payment, by realization upon security, through the exercise of any
right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the
enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate
protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code,
receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of
principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due and owing to the Lenders
and the Board hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the
"Aggregate Amounts Due") which is greater than the proportion received by any
other Lender or the Board in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other
Lender or the Board, then the Lender or the Board receiving such proportionately
greater payment shall (i) notify the Agent and each other Lender and the Board
of the receipt of such payment and (ii) (A) in the case of a Lender, (1) apply a
portion of such payment to purchase participations equal to the portion of the
Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders and (2) pay to the Board the portion
of the Aggregate Amounts Due to it or (B) in the case of the Board, pay to each
Lender the portion of the Aggregate Amounts Due to it (which participations
shall be deemed to have been purchased and payments made simultaneously upon the
receipt by the seller or the Board of its portion of such payment, and which
participations will be permitted notwithstanding any prohibition) to the
contrary in Section 11.2(e)) so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts
Due shall be shared by all Lenders and the Board in proportion to the Aggregate
Amounts Due to them, provided that if all or part of such proportionately
greater payment received by such purchasing Lender or the Board is

                                       95

<PAGE>

thereafter recovered from such Lender or the Board upon the bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, those purchases or other payments
shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations or other
payments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender or the Board ratably to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower expressly consents
to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so
purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or
counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by the Borrower to that
holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of
the participation held by that holder.

                Section 11.7.   Notices, Etc. Unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, any notice, request or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served or sent
by telefacsimile or courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when
delivered in person or by courier service, or upon receipt of telefacsimile
(promptly confirmed in writing). For the purposes hereof, the address of each
party hereto shall be as set forth under such party's name on Annex A or such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice delivered
to the Agent. A copy of any and all notices, requests, communications, demands,
reports, documents or other materials (including, without limitation, any of the
materials delivered by the Obligors under Section 5.1(b)) delivered or sent by
any party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be given to the Loan
Administrator.

                Section 11.8.   No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of
the Board, any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                Section 11.9.   Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (AND, TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE, THE BANKRUPTCY CODE); PROVIDED, THAT IN THE EVENT THE BOARD BECOMES
A LENDER PURSUANT TO THE BOARD GUARANTY, THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE BOARD
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE FEDERAL
LAW OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IF AND TO THE EXTENT SUCH FEDERAL LAW IS
APPLICABLE, AND OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                Section 11.10.  Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.

                (a)     Submission to Jurisdiction. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF
THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OBLIGOR HEREBY AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST
IT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS
PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID
COURTS. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY
OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON
CONVENIENS, WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY
SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS.

                                       96

<PAGE>

                (b)     Service of Process. EACH OF THE OBLIGORS HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS,
NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THE UNITED

WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 11.7.

                (c)     No Limitation. Nothing contained in this Section 11.10

process in any other manner permitted by law or commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against any Obligor in any other jurisdiction.

                Section 11.11.  Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OBLIGOR IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT

                Section 11.12.  Marshaling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in
favor of any Obligor or any other party or against or in payment of any or all
of the Obligations. To the extent that any Obligor makes a payment or payments
to the Agent for the account of the Board, the Loan Administrator or any Lender
(each, a "Payee") or any Payee receives payment from exercise of their rights of
setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such setoff or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party,
then (i) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied, and all rights and remedies therefor, shall
be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not
been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred and (ii) each Payee
shall pay and return such amount to the Agent as the Agent may be required to
disgorge or otherwise pay to a trustee, receiver or any other party in respect
of the portion of the payment from such Obligor distributed by the Agent to such

proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, so long as any
Commercial Paper issued by the Primary Tranche A Lender shall be outstanding or

which any such Commercial Paper shall have been outstanding.

                Section 11.18.  KHFC Administrative Agent. Each of the Borrower,

Paper holders. The parties hereto agree that none of the provisions hereof shall
at any time apply to, or restrict, the ability of the KHFC Administrative Agent
to resign its position of KHFC Administrative Agent; provided that any express
indemnification obligations of the Primary Tranche A Lender and/or the KHFC
Administrative Agent contained in this Agreement shall not be affected by this
Section 11.18 and such obligations shall remain in full force and effect.

                Section 11.19.  Acknowledgment Regarding Federal Authority.

                (a)     Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that:

                (i)     the operations and assets of the Obligors (including,
        without limitation, Aircraft Related Equipment and other assets that
        constitute Collateral) are subject, directly and indirectly, to the
        actions, inaction and policies of various Governmental Authorities,
        including, in particular but without limitation, the United States
        Department of Transportation (of which the FAA is a component) and the
        United States Department of Justice;

                (ii)    Governmental Authorities, in discharging their current
        and future statutory or regulatory responsibilities, may act, decline to
        act, or adopt policies resulting in material adverse effects on (A) the
        business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
        prospects, assets or properties of the Obligors, (B) the ability of the
        Obligors to perform their payment or other material obligations under
        the Loan Documents, and (C) the value of the Collateral or the practical
        ability of the Collateral Agent to realize such value in the event of a
        Default or an Event of Default;

                (iii)   no Governmental Authority, in discharging its statutory
        or regulatory responsibilities, has or shall have any obligation
        whatsoever to the Obligors, or to any secured party by reason of such
        Governmental Authority's representation on the Board, the Board's
        issuance of the Board Guaranty, or the Board's participation as a party
        to the other Loan Documents, to consider the potential that any of the
        material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above may result
        from such Governmental Authority's discharge of its statutory or
        regulatory responsibilities; and

                (iv)    neither the Board, in discharging its rights and
        responsibilities, or in exercising its discretion, under the Act, the
        Regulations, the Board Guaranty or the other Loan Documents, nor any of
        the Board's members, acting in their capacities as such, has or shall
        have any obligation whatsoever to the Obligors or to any of the secured
        parties to take any action in connection with a Governmental Authority's
        discharge of its statutory or regulatory responsibilities which may have
        any of the material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above,
        and the Board may not take any action depriving a Governmental Authority
        of its rights and powers to discharge its statutory and regulatory
        responsibilities in any manner that may have any of the material adverse
        effects referred to in clause (ii) above.

<PAGE>

                (b)     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Department of Transportation, through
the FAA, has broad authority under Title 49 of the United States Code to
regulate the use of the navigable airspace of the United States so as to ensure
its safe and efficient utilization, (ii) the exercise of such authority may
substantially impair or eliminate altogether the utility to the Obligors and
value to the secured parties of Aircraft Related Equipment pledged as Collateral
and other assets of the Obligors such as gates and slots utilized at airports,
(iii) nothing in this Agreement or in the Slot Security Agreement shall be
construed or asserted by any of the parties to impede or interfere with the
FAA's exercise of its authority under the Slot Regulations, and (iv) no
assurance, express or implied, has been given by any Governmental Authority,
including the Board, to the Obligors or to any secured party, nor has any of the
Obligors or any secured party relied upon any such assurance, with respect to
any future action, inaction or policy of the FAA or any other Governmental
Authority relating to any such Collateral or other assets.

                Section 11.20.  Independence of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants. All representations and warranties made in and covenants under this
Agreement shall be given independent effect so that (a) if a particular
representation and warranty is unqualified, the fact that another representation
and warranty is qualified shall not affect the operation of the former
provision; and (b) if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any
of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid
the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default if such action is taken or
condition exists.
