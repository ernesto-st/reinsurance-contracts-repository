following the termination of the Executive&#146;s employment if he is entitled to severance payments
pursuant to subparagraph 8(a), the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, as a shareholder, officer, director, partner, consultant, employee or otherwise, engage in
any business or enterprise which is &#147;in competition&#148; with the Company, its affiliates, or their
successors or assigns (such entities collectively referred to hereinafter in this paragraph 11 as
the &#147;Company&#148;); provided, however, that the Executive&#146;s ownership of less than five percent of the
issued and outstanding voting securities of a publicly traded company shall not, in and of itself,
be deemed to constitute such competition. A business or enterprise is deemed to be &#147;in
competition&#148; if it is engaged, in any of the geographical regions in which the Company conducts the
casualty reinsurance underwriting business on the Date of Termination or any other business which
the Executive is supervising.

the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets,
methods, know-how or data relating to the Company and their businesses or acquisition prospects
(including the compensation and other terms of employment of their employees) that the Executive
obtained or obtains during the Executive&#146;s employment by the Company and that is not and does not
become generally known to the public (other than as a result of the Executive&#146;s violation of this
paragraph 11) (&#147;Confidential Information&#148;). Except as may be required and appropriate in
connection with carrying out his duties under this Agreement, the Executive shall not communicate,
divulge, or disseminate any material Confidential Information at any time during or after the
Executive&#146;s employment with the Company, except with the prior written consent of the Company or as
otherwise required by law or legal process; provided, however, that if so required, the Executive
will provide the Company with reasonable notice to contest such disclosure.

confidential information about other employees of the Company relating to their education,
experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and inter-personal relationships with
suppliers to and customers of the Company. The Executive recognizes that the information he will
possess about these other employees may not be generally known, may be of substantial value to the
Company in developing its respective businesses and in securing and retaining customers, and may be
acquired by him because of his business position with the Company. The Executive agrees that, for
a period of one year following the termination of the Executive&#146;s employment if he is entitled to
severance payments pursuant to subparagraph 8(a), he will not, directly or indirectly, initiate any
action to solicit or recruit or hire anyone who is then an employee of the Company for the purpose
of being employed by him or by any business, individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other

money damages will not afford the Company an adequate remedy. Therefore, if the provisions of

specific performance and injunctive relief (without having to post any bond), without prejudice to
other remedies the Company may have at law or in equity.

or circumstances shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this paragraph
11, or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to
which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and
provision of this paragraph 11 shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
law. Moreover, if a court of competent jurisdiction deems any provision hereof to be too broad in
time, scope, or area, it is expressly agreed that such provision shall be reformed to the maximum
degree that would not render it unenforceable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">12. <U>Assignment</U>. This is a personal services agreement and the Executive may not assign
this Agreement to any third party. The Company may assign this Agreement and the benefits
hereunder without the consent of the Executive, without being relieved of any liability hereunder,
to one of its direct or indirect &#147;affiliates&#148; or &#147;associates&#148; as those terms are defined in Rule
405 of the Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company may
assign this Agreement and the benefits hereunder to any entity (corporate or other) into which the
Company or the business of the Company may be merged, consolidated or transferred but nothing
contained herein shall release the Company of any of its obligations hereunder.

dispute or difference between the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and the enforcement of rights hereunder, either the Executive or the Company may, by
written notice to the other, require such dispute or difference to be submitted to arbitration.
The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if they cannot
agree on an arbitrator or arbitrators within 30&nbsp;days after the date arbitration is required by
either party, then the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by the American Arbitration
Association (the &#147;AAA&#148;) upon the application of the Executive or the Company. The determination
reached in such arbitration shall be final and binding on both parties without any right of appeal
or further dispute. Execution of the determination by such arbitrator may be sought in any court
of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrators shall not be bound by judicial formalities and may
abstain from following the strict rules of evidence and shall interpret this Agreement as an
honorable engagement and not merely as a legal obligation. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
any such arbitration shall take place in Stamford, Connecticut.
