such a solution within a period of thirty (30)&nbsp;days after written notice by either party requesting that such discussions be initiated, the parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be submitted to resolution in the following manner: </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(i) The parties shall endeavor to resolve the dispute
through the use of non-binding mediation or an acceptable alternative dispute resolution procedure. Senior managers of each party shall meet within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after written notice from any party that mediation is desired to discuss the
issues and propose solutions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(ii) If within 30 days after one party notifies the others in writing of the existence of a
dispute, either party may, at its option, provide written notice of the intent to arbitrate. Arbitration shall be according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association (but shall not be administered by the American Arbitration Association),
except as herein modified by the parties or otherwise as agreed to by the parties. Within 10 days of receipt of such notice of intent to arbitrate, each party will select an arbitrator, and notify the other party of its selection. Within 15 days
after such notice, the respective arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as the Chairman of the panel. Such arbitrators shall have experience in the business of producing, procuring and selling forest products in the state in which the Wood was
or is to be delivered. The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a hearing by the arbitration panel to be held within 30 days after the selection of the Chairman and a majority decision of the panel and resolution to be reached
within 30 days of such hearing. Decisions of the panel must be in writing and will be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment may be entered thereon by any court having jurisdiction. </FONT></P> <P

alternative dispute resolution procedure, as the case may be. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(c) Except as otherwise described in paragraph 7 or actions brought to enforce an arbitral
award or the provisions of this paragraph 20, the dispute resolution process set out herein shall be the sole mechanism for dispute resolution. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">21.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(b) SELLER shall provide to BUYER a written Annual Harvest Plan for each Harvest Year detailing the planned harvest
volume for Logs no later than September&nbsp;1 of the year preceding such Harvest Year. The Annual Harvest Plan will contain information for each individual Tract on the Timberlands that is scheduled for the harvest of Logs during the Harvest year,
including average Diameter at Breast Height (&#147;DBH&#148;) of Logs, volume of Logs, and a map showing Tract location. The Annual Harvest Plan for each Harvest Year shall be in substantially the same amounts as in the Master Harvest Plan set out
in Schedule 1, provided, however, that in no event shall the actual amount made available for harvest in any given Harvest Year be less than eighty percent (80%)&nbsp;of the Master Harvest Plan volumes. SELLER and BUYER shall meet no sooner than
thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt of the Annual Harvest Plan, but in no event later than forty-five days (45)&nbsp;prior to January&nbsp;1 of each Harvest Year, for Tract Selection. From the written Annual Harvest Plan of all Tracts submitted by
SELLER, BUYER shall first designate an individual Tract to be included as an Obligated Tract, with SELLER next designating an individual Tract to be excluded as an Obligated Tract. BUYER and SELLER shall continue to take turns designating Tracts for
inclusion and exclusion as Obligated Tracts until the total Log volume on all Obligated Tracts designated by BUYER collectively equals (<U>i</U>)&nbsp;for the 2007 Harvest Year, not less than 30%, and not more than 60%, of the Annual Harvest Plan
for such year (as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion), and (<U>ii</U>)&nbsp;for each Harvest Year after 2007, a percentage of the Annual Harvest Plan volume (as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion) that is within a range of 15
percentage points above or below the percentage of Annual Harvest Plan volume selected by Buyer in the previous Harvest Year, provided that the volume determined by Buyer shall be not less than 30%, and not more than 60%, of the Annual Harvest Plan
for the current Harvest Year. If the list of all Tracts in the Annual Harvest Plan is exhausted and the total Log volume of all Obligated Tracts designated by BUYER is not equal to the maximum volume percentage available for selection for the
applicable Harvest Year, then BUYER may request SELLER to selectively designate additional Tracts from its previously excluded list to be added to BUYER&#146;s list of designated Tracts until the total Log volume on all of BUYER&#146;s designated
Obligated Tracts equals the maximum volume percentage available for selection. The total Log volume on all Obligated Tracts for a Harvest Year is the Obligated Volume of Logs of that Harvest Year that SELLER must deliver to BUYER and that BUYER must
accept from SELLER, except that in the event the total Log volume on all Obligated Tracts exceeds the Obligated Volume for such Harvest Year, then SELLER may prorate Log deliveries from the last Tract selected so that the total Log volume delivered
to BUYER equals the Obligated Volume for such Harvest Year. In the event that the total Log volume from all Obligated Tracts delivered to BUYER does not equal the total Log volume represented by SELLER to exist on all of the Obligated Tracts, then
BUYER may request SELLER to deliver the additional volume of Logs from other Tract(s) on the Timberlands to BUYER necessary to fulfill the total Log volume represented by BUYER to exist on all of the Obligated Tracts. Such additional Log volume
shall be substantially similar in size, quality, and distance from the mill as the original volume. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(c) It is understood and agreed that BUYER&#146;s

delivery schedules, with appropriate consideration given to weather limitations on harvesting, trucking, and mill inventory constraints. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon the Delivery Plan prior to the start of the Harvest Year, Logs

(5)&nbsp;percent of the annual Delivery Plan. If the annual negative variance is five (5)&nbsp;percentage points or less at the end of any Harvest Year, SELLER shall be required, if requested by BUYER, to deliver such variance (the &#147;Carryover
Volume&#148;) in the first quarter of the following Harvest Year, at a price equal to the lowest negotiated quarterly price for such Tract during the previous Harvest Year. Any deliveries in the following Harvest Year will first be counted towards
meeting the Carryover Volume requirement. Deliveries during the fourth quarter shall only be applied against the then current Harvest Year&#146;s delivery requirements. The parties shall work together to adjust delivery schedules to accommodate

except as herein modified by the parties or otherwise as agreed to by the parties. Within 10 days of receipt of such notice of intent to arbitrate, each party will select an arbitrator, and notify the other party of its selection. Within 15 days
after such notice, the respective arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator as the Chairman of the panel. Such arbitrators shall have experience in the business of producing, procuring and selling forest products in the state in which the Logs
were or are to be delivered. The parties will use their diligent efforts to cause a hearing by the panel to be held within 30 days after the selection of the Chairman and a majority decision of the panel and resolution to be reached within 30 days

upon the panel&#146;s determination of the price that better reflects the actual market price for the subject Logs. If only one proposed price is submitted, the panel will choose such price. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(iii) The panel will deliver the decision in writing to each if the parties within 3 days following the date of its determination and
