SECTION 2         REVOLVING LOANS; INTEREST RATES; FEES; AND CERTAIN TERMS OF
                  PAYMENT AND REPAYMENT AND OTHER MATTERS

         2.1.     REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS; MAKING OF REVOLVING LOANS; THE
                  REGISTER; OPTIONAL NOTES.

                  A.       REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and
warranties of Borrowers herein set forth, each Lender severally, and not jointly
and severally, agrees to make a portion of its Letter of Credit Commitment
available as Revolving Loans to be made to Borrowers from time to time during
the period from the Closing Date to but excluding the Maturity Date in an
aggregate amount not exceeding such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments (as hereinafter defined) to be used for
the purposes identified in subsection 2.5A. The original amount of the portion
of each Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment that is available for the making of
Revolving Loans to Borrowers (such Lender's "REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT") is set
forth opposite its name on

                                      -40-
<PAGE>

Schedule 2.1 annexed hereto and the aggregate original amount of such portions
of the Letter of Credit Commitments that are available for the making of
Revolving Loans to Borrowers is $10,000,000 (the "REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS");
provided, however, that the Revolving Loan Commitments of Lenders shall be
adjusted to give effect to any assignments of the Revolving Loan Commitments
pursuant to subsection 10.1B and shall be reduced from time to time by the
amount of any reductions thereto made pursuant to subsection 2.4. Each Lender's
Revolving Loan Commitment shall expire on the day before the Maturity Date and
all Revolving Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the
Revolving Loans and the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be paid in full no
later than the Maturity Date. Amounts borrowed under this subsection 2.1A may be
repaid and reborrowed up to but excluding the Maturity Date. Anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall any
Revolving Loan be requested or made if, after giving effect thereto, (i) the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding would exceed the
aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect or (ii) the aggregate Credit
Utilization then in effect would exceed the aggregate Letter of Credit
Commitments then in effect.

                  B.       BORROWING MECHANICS. Revolving Loans made on any
Funding Date shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $200,000 and integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount (or, if the amount of the
Revolving Loan Commitments unfunded and available for borrowing is less than
such aggregate minimum amount, an amount equal to the amount of the Revolving
Loan Commitments unfunded and available for borrowing); provided that Revolving
Loans made on any Funding Date as Eurodollar Rate Loans with a particular
Interest Period shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral
multiples of $200,000 in excess of that amount. Whenever Borrowers desire that
Lenders make Revolving Loans they shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice
of Borrowing no later than 10:00 A.M. (Chicago time) at least three Business
Days in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Eurodollar Rate
Loan) or at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in
the case of a Base Rate Loan). Revolving Loans may be continued as or converted
into Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans in the manner provided in
subsection 2.2D. In lieu of delivering a Notice of Borrowing, Borrowers may give
Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed
borrowing under this subsection 2.1B; provided that such notice shall be
promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a duly executed Notice of Borrowing
to Administrative Agent on or before the applicable Funding Date.

                  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any
liability to any Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above
that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by an
Officer of a Borrower or for otherwise acting in good faith under this
subsection 2.1B or under subsection 2.2D, and upon funding of Revolving Loans by
Lenders, and upon conversion or continuation of the applicable basis for
determining the interest rate with respect to any Revolving Loans pursuant to
subsection 2.2D, in each case in accordance with this Agreement, pursuant to any
such telephonic notice Borrowers shall have effected Revolving Loans or a
conversion or continuation thereof, as the case may be.

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

                  Borrowers shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the
funding of any Revolving Loans in the event that any of the matters to which
Borrowers are required to certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing is no
longer true and correct as of the applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by
Borrowers of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans shall constitute a
re-certification by Borrowers, as of the applicable Funding Date, as to the
matters to which Borrowers are required to certify in the applicable Notice of
Borrowing.

                  Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and
2.6G, a Notice of Borrowing for, or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation for
conversion to, or continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan (or telephonic notice
in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate
Determination Date, and Borrowers shall be bound to make a borrowing or to
effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection
2.1B, no Eurodollar Rate Loans may be made and no Base Rate Loan may be
converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan until the third Business Day after the
Closing Date.

                  C.       DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS. All Revolving Loans under this
Agreement shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their
respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that neither Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in
that other Lender's obligation to make a Revolving Loan requested hereunder nor
shall the Commitment of any Lender to make a Revolving Loan requested be
increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that
other Lender's obligation to make a Revolving Loan requested hereunder. Promptly
after receipt by Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to
subsection 2.1B (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) or a notice deemed to be
a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to subsection 2.1B, Administrative Agent shall
notify each Lender of the proposed borrowing. Each such Lender shall make the
amount of its Revolving Loan available to Administrative Agent not later than
12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the applicable Funding Date, in same day funds in
Dollars, at the Funding and Payment Office. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions precedent specified in subsections 4.1 (in the case of Revolving
Loans made on the Closing Date) and 4.2 (in the case of all Revolving Loans),
Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Revolving Loans available
to Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by causing an amount of same day
funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Revolving Loans received by
Administrative Agent from Lenders to be credited to the account of Borrowers at
the Funding and Payment Office.

                  Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any
Lender prior to a Funding Date that such Lender does not intend to make
available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan
requested on such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and
Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by
such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative Agent for the
correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify Borrowers and Borrowers shall immediately pay such corresponding amount
to Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such
Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the
rate payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Nothing in this
subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Borrowers may
have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

                  D.       SWINGLINE LOANS. Subject to each of the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall make each Revolving
Loan, on behalf of Revolving Lenders and in the amount requested, available to
Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date in the manner set forth in subsection
2.1C. Each Revolving Loan made solely by Administrative Agent pursuant to this
subsection 2.1D is referred to in this Agreement as a "SWINGLINE LOAN" and such
Revolving Loans are referred to in this Agreement collectively as "SWINGLINE
LOANS". Each Swingline Loan shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions
applicable to other Revolving Loans funded by Revolving Lenders (including,
without limitation, the conditions set forth in Section 4), except that all
payments thereon shall be payable to Administrative Agent solely for its own
account (other than as expressly set forth in the Inter-Lender Agreement). All
Swingline Loans shall be secured by the Liens under the Collateral Documents and
shall constitute Revolving Loans for all purposes hereunder and under each other
Credit Document. At any time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, Administrative Agent may request settlement of any
Swingline Loans (a "SETTLEMENT") with the Revolving Lenders by notifying the
Revolving Lenders of such requested Settlement by telecopy or telephone no later
than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date of such requested Settlement (the
"SETTLEMENT DATE"). Each Revolving Lender (excluding Administrative Agent in all
events) agrees to transfer in immediately available funds the entire amount of
such Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding principal balance of
the Swingline Loan with respect to which a Settlement has been requested to
Administrative Agent, at such account of Administrative Agent as Administrative
Agent may designate, no later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Settlement
Date. The foregoing obligations of the Revolving Lenders in respect of
Settlements shall be unconditional (it being understood for the avoidance of
doubt that Settlements may occur during the existence of an Event of Default or
Potential Event of Default and regardless of whether the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 4 have been satisfied). Such amounts that are transferred
by the Revolving Lenders to Administrative Agent shall be applied against the
outstanding principal balance of the applicable Swingline Loan and shall
constitute Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lenders, respectively. If any such
amount in respect of a Swingline Loan is not transferred to Administrative Agent
by any Revolving Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto, then
Administrative Agent shall be unconditionally entitled to recover such amount on
demand from such Revolving

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

Lender together with interest thereon at the rate applicable to such Swingline
Loan hereunder.

                  E.       THE REGISTER. Administrative Agent, acting for these
purposes solely as an agent of Borrowers (it being acknowledged that
Administrative Agent, in such capacity, and its officers, directors, employees,
agent and affiliates shall constitute Indemnitees under subsection 10.3), shall
maintain (and make available for inspection by Borrowers and Lenders upon
reasonable prior notice at reasonable times) at its address referred to in
subsection 10.8 a register for the recordation of, and shall record, the names
and addresses of Lenders and the Revolving Loan Commitment, Letter of Credit
Commitment, Revolving Loans and participations in Letters of Credit of each
Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). Borrowers, Administrative Agent and
Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as
the holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments, Revolving Loans and
participations listed therein for all purposes hereof; all amounts owed with
respect to any Commitment, Revolving Loan or participation shall be owed to the
Lender listed in the Register as the owner thereof; and any request, authority
or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the
corresponding Commitments or Revolving Loans. Each Lender shall record on its
internal records the amount of its participation, Revolving Loans and
Commitments and each payment in respect hereof, and any such recordation shall
be conclusive and binding on Borrowers, absent manifest error, subject to the
entries in the Register, which shall, absent manifest error, govern in the event
of any inconsistency with any Lender's records. Failure to make any recordation
in the Register or in any Lender's records, or any error in such recordation,
shall not affect any participations, Revolving Loans or Commitments or any
Obligations in respect of any Revolving Loans or participations.

                  F.       OPTIONAL NOTES. If so requested by any Lender by
written notice to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date or at any time thereafter, Borrowers
shall execute and deliver to such Lender (and/or, if applicable and if so
specified in such notice, to any Person who is an assignee of such Lender
pursuant to subsection 10.1) on the Closing Date (or, if such notice is
delivered after the date which is two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
promptly after Company's receipt of such notice) a promissory note or promissory
notes to evidence such Lender's Revolving Loans, substantially in the form of
Exhibit II annexed hereto, with appropriate insertions, including the principal
amount of that Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment.

         2.2.     INTEREST ON THE REVOLVING LOANS.

         A.       RATE OF INTEREST. Subject to the provisions of subsections 2.6
and 2.7, each Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount
thereof from the date made until repayment in full at a rate determined by
reference to the Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate. The applicable basis for
determining the rate of interest with respect to any Revolving Loan shall be
selected by Borrowers initially at the time a Notice of Borrowing is

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

given with respect to such Revolving Loan pursuant to subsection 2.2B (subject
to the last sentence of subsection 2.1B), and the basis for determining the
interest rate with respect to any Revolving Loan may be changed from time to
time pursuant to subsection 2.2B (subject to the last sentence of subsection
2.1B); provided, that if an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default then
exists, Borrowers shall not be entitled to request that any Revolving Loan be
made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan. If on any day a Revolving Loan is outstanding
with respect to which notice has not been delivered to Administrative Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying the applicable basis for
determining the rate of interest, then for that day that Revolving Loan shall
bear interest determined by reference to the Base Rate. Subject to the
provisions of subsections 2.2E, 2.2G and 2.7, the Revolving Loans shall bear
interest through maturity as follows:

                  (i)      if a Base Rate Loan, then at the sum of the Base Rate
         plus the Base Rate Margin; or

                  (ii)     if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at the sum of the
         Eurodollar Rate plus the Eurodollar Rate Margin.

                  B.       INTEREST PERIODS. In connection with each Eurodollar
Rate Loan, Borrowers shall, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an the interest
period (each, an "INTEREST PERIOD") to be applicable to such Revolving Loan,
which Interest Period shall be a one-, two- or three-month period; provided
that:

                  (i)      the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate
         Loan shall commence on the Funding Date in respect of such Revolving
         Loan, in the case of a Revolving Loan initially made as a Eurodollar
         Rate Loan, or on the date specified in the applicable Notice of
         Conversion/Continuation, in the case of a Revolving Loan converted to a
         Eurodollar Rate Loan;

                  (ii)     in the case of immediately successive Interest
         Periods applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan continued as such pursuant
         to a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, each successive Interest Period
         shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period
         expires;

                  (iii)    if an Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
         that is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the
         next succeeding Business Day; provided that, if any Interest Period
         would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day
         of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month,
         such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

                  (iv)     any Interest Period that begins on the last Business
         Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically
         corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest
         Period) shall, subject to clause (v) of this subsection 2.2B, end on
         the last Business Day of a calendar month;

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

                  (v)      no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the
         Revolving Loans shall extend beyond the Maturity Date in effect at the
         commencement of such Interest Period; and

                  (vi)     there shall be no more than four Interest Periods
         outstanding at any time.

                  C.       INTEREST PAYMENTS. Subject to the provisions of
subsection 2.2E, interest on each Revolving Loan shall be payable in arrears on
and to each Interest Payment Date applicable to that Revolving Loan, upon any
prepayment of that Revolving Loan (to the extent accrued on the amount being
prepaid) and at maturity (including final maturity).

                  D.       CONVERSION OR CONTINUATION. Subject to the provisions
of subsection 2.6, Borrowers shall have the option (i) to convert at any time
all or any part of their outstanding Revolving Loans equal to $200,000 and
integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount from Revolving Loans
bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to one basis to Revolving
Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to an alternative basis
or (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar
Rate Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Revolving Loan equal to
$500,000 and integral multiples of $200,000 in excess of that amount as a
Eurodollar Rate Loan; provided, however, that (a) no Base Rate Loan may be
converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan and no Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued as a Eurodollar Rate Loan if an Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default then exists and (b) a Eurodollar Rate Loan may only be converted into a
Base Rate Loan on the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable thereto.

                  Borrowers shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to
Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 A.M. (Chicago time) at least one
Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a
conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of
the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a
continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). In lieu of delivering a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation Borrowers may give Administrative Agent telephonic
notice by the required time of any proposed conversion/continuation under this
subsection 2.2D; provided that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in
writing by delivery of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Administrative
Agent on or before the proposed conversion/continuation date. Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any Revolving Loan subject to the
Notice of Conversion/Continuation.

                  E.       DEFAULT RATE. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default and notice to Borrowers from Administrative
Agent, the outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans and, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments thereon not paid when
due and any fees and other amounts then due and payable hereunder (but not
including amounts drawn under any Letter of Credit that are not reimbursed by
Borrowers when required under subsection 3.3), shall thereafter bear interest
(including post petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or
other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable upon demand at a rate that is (i) in
the case of any

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

Revolving Loans, 2.00% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise
payable under this Agreement with respect to such Revolving Loans or (ii) in the
case of fees and other amounts, 2.00% per annum in excess of the interest rate
otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Payment or
acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection
2.2E is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a
waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or
remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                  F.       COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Revolving
Loans and other amounts bearing interest with reference to the Base Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number
of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on
any Revolving Loan or amount funded in a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the
date of the making of such Revolving Loan or the date of funding of such drawing
or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Revolving Loan or,
with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a Eurodollar Rate Loan,
the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as
the case may be, shall be included; and the date of payment of such Revolving
Loan or funded drawing or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable
to such Revolving Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such
Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided that if a
Revolving Loan or funded drawing is repaid on the same day on which it is made,
one day's interest shall be paid on that Revolving Loan or funded drawing.

                  G.       MAXIMUM RATE. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this subsection 2.2, in no event shall the rate of interest
payable by Borrowers with respect to any Revolving Loan or funded drawing under
any Letter of Credit exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged
under applicable law.

         2.3.     FEES.

                  A.       AGENCY FEE. Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree
to pay to Administrative Agent on the Closing Date and each anniversary of the
Closing Date (excluding the Maturity Date), for Administrative Agent's own
account and in advance for the forthcoming year, an annual agency fee in an
amount equal to $30,000. Each such annual maintenance fee shall be fully-earned
and non-refundable when due.

                  B.       COMMITMENT FEE. Borrowers, jointly and severally,
agree to pay to Administrative Agent, for distribution to Issuing Lender and
Lenders (with the allocation among Issuing Lender and Lenders to be as set forth
in the Inter-Lender Agreement and the allocation among Lenders to be in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares), commitment fees for the period
from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Maturity Date equal to
(i) the daily excess of the aggregate Letter of Credit Commitments over the
aggregate Credit Utilization, multiplied by (ii) the Commitment Fee Percentage,
expressed as a daily rate. Such commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on
and to (but excluding) the last day of each fiscal quarter and on the Maturity
Date and computed on the basis of a 360-day year, for the actual number of days
elapsed.

                  C.       CLOSING FEE. Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree
to pay on the Closing Date to Lenders, in proportion to their respective Pro
Rata Shares, a closing fee in an aggregate amount that is equal to two percent
(2.00%) of the total amount of the Letter of Credit Commitments of Lenders
hereunder as of the Closing Date.

                  D.       OTHER FEES. Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree
to pay to Administrative Agent such fees in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between Company and Administrative Agent. All fees
referenced in this subsection 2.3 shall be earned when payable and shall be
non-refundable.

                  PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS; APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF
                  COLLATERAL.

                  A.       PREPAYMENTS AND REDUCTIONS IN COMMITMENTS.

                  (i)      Voluntary Prepayments. Borrowers may, upon not less
         than one Business Day's prior written or telephonic notice, in the case
         of Base Rate Loans, and three Business Days' prior written or
         telephonic notice, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case
         given to Administrative Agent by 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date
         required and, if given by telephone, promptly confirmed in writing to
         Administrative Agent, who will promptly notify each Lender whose
         Revolving Loans are to be prepaid of such prepayment, at any time and
         from time to time prepay any Revolving Loans on any Business Day in
         whole or in part in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount (or, if the
         amount of the Revolving Loans is less than such aggregate minimum
         amount, an amount equal to the amount of the Revolving Loans); provided
         that voluntary prepayments of Eurodollar Rate Loans made on a date
         other than an Interest Payment Date applicable to such Eurodollar Rate
         Loan shall be subject to breakage fees, costs and expenses, if any, in
         accordance with subsection 2.6D. Notice of prepayment having been given
         as aforesaid, the principal amount of the Revolving Loans specified in
         such notice shall become due and payable on the prepayment date
         specified therein. Any such voluntary prepayment shall be applied as
         specified in subsection 2.4A(iv).

                  (ii)     Voluntary Reductions of Commitments. Borrowers may,
         upon not less than one Business Day's prior written or telephonic
         notice confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent, at any time and
         from time to time, terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part,
         without premium or penalty, (a) the Revolving Loan Commitments in an
         amount up to the amount by which the Revolving Loan Commitments exceed
         the aggregate Revolving Loans outstanding at the time of such proposed
         termination or reduction or (b) the Letter of Credit Commitments in an
         amount up to the amount by which the Letter of Credit Commitments
         exceed the Letter of Credit Usage at the time of such proposed
         termination or reduction; provided that any such partial reduction of
         either the Revolving Loan Commitments or the Letter of Credit
         Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Borrowers'

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

         notice to Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify each
         Revolving Lender or Letter of Credit Lender, as applicable, of such
         notice) shall designate the date (which shall be a Business Day) of
         such termination or reduction and the amount of any partial reduction,
         and such termination or reduction of any of the Commitments shall be
         effective on the date specified in Company's notice and shall reduce
         the particular type of Commitment of each Lender proportionately to its
         Pro Rata Share. No such voluntary reduction of the Commitments shall be
         permitted if such reduction would result in (1) the Revolving Loan
         Commitments being less than the aggregate principal amount of all
         outstanding Revolving Loans, or (2) the aggregate Letter of Credit
         Commitments being less than the aggregate Letter of Credit Usage then
         in effect.

                  (iii)    Mandatory Payments. Mandatory Payments shall be made
         in the amounts and under the circumstances set forth below, all such
         Mandatory Payments to be applied to repay the Obligations and/or
         permanently reduce the Commitments as set forth below or as more
         specifically provided in subsection 2.4A(iv), except to the extent that
         the Intercreditor Agreement requires application thereof in a different
         manner than as set forth in this subsection 2.4A(iii) or subsection
         2.4A(iv) (it being understood that if a payment is made in accordance
         with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a duplicate payment
         shall not be required hereunder and the application required under the
         terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall apply as if set forth
         herein):

                           (a)      Net Asset Sale Proceeds. No later than 2

                  Asset Sale, Company shall make a Mandatory Payment in an
                  aggregate amount equal to (1) to the extent that aggregate Net
                  Asset Sale Proceeds in respect of all Asset Sales made on or
                  prior to such date is $7,500,000 or less, 33.33% of such Net
                  Asset Sale Proceeds, or (2) to the extent that aggregate Net
                  Asset Sale Proceeds in respect of all Asset Sales made on or
                  prior to such date exceeds $7,500,000, 100% of such excess
                  (without duplication).

                           (b)      Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds. No
                  later than the fifth Business Day following the date of
                  receipt by Administrative Agent or by Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries of any Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds that
                  are required to be used for a Mandatory Payment pursuant to
                  the provisions of subsection 6.4C, Company shall make a
                  Mandatory Payment in an aggregate amount equal to the amount
                  of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds.

                           (c)      Issuance of Indebtedness. On the date of
                  receipt of the Net Indebtedness Proceeds from the issuance of
                  any Indebtedness of Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
                  the Closing Date, other than Indebtedness permitted pursuant
                  to subsections 7.1(i) through (xvi), Company shall make a
                  Mandatory Payment in an aggregate amount equal to such Net
                  Indebtedness Proceeds.

                           (d)      Tax Refunds. If after the Closing Date,
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives any payment of a
                  cash refund or rebate of any Tax, the Borrowers shall no later
                  than the Business Day following the date of receipt of such
                  refund or rebate make a Mandatory Payment in the amount of
                  such Tax refund or rebate, except to the extent such
                  application would constitute a material violation of a valid
                  Contractual Obligation in connection with a Project of Company
                  or any of its Subsidiaries to remit such refund or rebate to
                  the client of such Project.

                           (e)      Annual Free Cash Flow. In the event that
                  there shall be Annual Free Cash Flow for any Fiscal Year

                  during the continuance of an Event of Default, 100%) of such
                  Annual Free Cash Flow; provided, however, that the amount of
                  such Mandatory Payment shall be reduced by the amount of cash,
                  if any, applied to cash collateralize Letter of Credit
                  Exposure pursuant to subsection 2.4A(iii)(f) during the four
                  Fiscal Quarters most recently preceding the date of such
                  Mandatory Payment.

                           (f)      Excess Cash. Any amounts on deposit in the

                  or required to be held in Deposit Accounts which are
                  Restricted Accounts described on Schedule 2.4A(iii)(f) annexed
                  hereto, as said Schedule 2.4A(iii)(f) may be supplemented from
                  time to time pursuant to the provisions of subsection
                  6.1(xvii)) (the aggregate of such amounts on deposit at any
                  time (excluding any amounts on deposit in accounts set forth

                  Exposure outstanding after giving effect to the foregoing
                  repayment of all funded amounts under the Letters of Credit in

                           (g)      Prepayments Due to Certain Changes of
                  Control. Upon the date on which any "change of control" or
                  "change in control" or event, however titled, shall occur that
                  requires under the High Yield Indenture a repurchase of the
                  High Yield Notes or an offer to repurchase High Yield Notes as
                  a result of a change in ownership of all or some portion of

                  any, under the Letters of Credit, then deposit into the
                  Collateral Account an amount equal to 105% of the Letter of
                  Credit Exposure outstanding after giving effect to the
                  foregoing repayment of all funded amounts under the Letters of
                  Credit and repay the principal balance of any outstanding
                  Revolving Loans, and (2) the right or obligation of Issuing
                  Lender to issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit
                  hereunder shall terminate and the right or obligation of any
                  Lender to make any new Revolving Loans hereunder shall
                  terminate.

                           (h)      Calculations of Net Proceeds Amounts;
                  Additional Prepayments and Reductions Based on Subsequent
                  Calculations. Concurrently with the receipt of any amount
                  which would require a Mandatory Payment pursuant to
                  subsections 2.4A(iii)(a) - (f), Company shall deliver to
                  Administrative Agent an Officer's Certificate demonstrating
                  the calculation of the amount of the applicable Net Asset Sale
                  Proceeds, Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, Net
                  Indebtedness Proceeds, cash in the Cash Management System,
                  Annual Free Cash Flow or Tax refund or rebate, as the case may
                  be, that gave rise to such Mandatory Payment. In the event
                  that Company shall subsequently determine that the actual
                  amount was greater than the amount set forth in such Officer's
                  Certificate, Company shall promptly make an additional
                  Mandatory Payment in an amount equal to the amount of such
                  excess, and Company shall concurrently therewith deliver to
                  Administrative Agent an Officer's Certificate demonstrating
                  the derivation of the additional amount resulting in such
                  excess.

                  (iv)     Application of Prepayments; Reduction of Commitments.

                           (a)      Application of Prepayments; Reduction of
                  Commitments. Except as provided in subsection 2.4C and the
                  last sentence of this subsection 2.4A(iv)(a) and to the extent
                  that the Intercreditor Agreement requires application of such
                  Mandatory Payment in a different manner than as set forth in
                  this sentence (it being understood that if a payment is made
                  in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a
                  duplicate payment shall not be required hereunder and the
                  application required under the terms of the Intercreditor
                  Agreement shall apply as if set forth herein), (1) any
                  voluntary prepayments of the Revolving Loans made pursuant to
                  subsection 2.4A shall be applied to repay outstanding
                  Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof, and (2) the
                  aggregate amount of any Mandatory Payments

                  Credit Exposure, with the amount applied to Letter of Credit
                  Exposure being applied to repay all funded amounts, if any,
                  under the Letters of Credit and then to cash collateralize the
                  Letter of Credit Exposure outstanding after giving effect to
                  the foregoing repayment of all funded amounts under the
                  Letters of Credit in an amount, taken together with all then
                  existing cash collateral for such Letter of Credit Exposure,
                  equal to 105% of such Letter of Credit Exposure; second, to
                  repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof
                  (and as a concurrent, permanent reduction of (x) the
                  unutilized Letter of Credit Commitments and (y) to the extent
                  that the unutilized Letter of Credit Commitments have been
                  reduced to an amount of $10,000,000 or less, the Revolving
                  Loan Commitments); and third, to permanently reduce the
                  unutilized Letter of Credit Commitments (and, to the extent
                  that the unutilized Letter of Credit Commitments have been
                  reduced to an amount of $10,000,000 or less, to permanently
                  and concurrently reduce the Revolving Loan Commitments).
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers and Lenders hereby
                  agree that any cash applied to collateralize Letter of Credit
                  Exposure pursuant to subsection 2.4A(iii)(f) with respect to a
                  cash balance on June 30 or December 31 of any Fiscal Year (the
                  "Subject Fiscal Year") shall in the event that the amount of
                  such cash applied to collateralize Letter of Credit Exposure
                  exceeds 50% of the Annual Free Cash Flow for the Subject
                  Fiscal Year, be released to Borrowers to the extent of such
                  excess (but in no event shall more cash be so released than
                  the aggregate amount applied pursuant to subsection
                  2.4A(iii)(f) with respect to the Subject Fiscal Year) after
                  the 60th day of the following Fiscal Year, promptly following
                  Borrowers' certification of such excess; provided, however,
                  that such release shall not be required if, at the time such
                  release would otherwise be required, an Event of Default shall
                  have occurred and be continuing; and provided, further, that
                  to the extent that the Intercreditor Agreement requires
                  application of such amounts in a different manner than as set
                  forth in this sentence, such amounts shall be applied in
                  accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

                           (b)      Application of Prepayments to Base Rate
                  Loans and Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any prepayment of Revolving
                  Loans shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full
                  extent thereof before application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in
                  each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any
                  payments required to be made by Borrowers pursuant to
                  subsection 2.6D.

                  (v)      Mandatory Reduction of Letter of Credit Commitments.
         Immediately upon the occurrence of any Permanent L/C Obligation
         Reduction, the Letter of Credit Commitments shall be permanently
         reduced in an amount equal to the amount of such Permanent L/C
         Obligation Reduction, and such reduction of the Letter of Credit
         Commitments shall reduce each Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment
         ratably. In

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

         addition, the Commitments shall be reduced as specifically provided in
         subsections 2.4A(ii), 2.4A(iii) and 2.4A(iv) above.

                  B.       GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS.

                  (i)      Manner and Time of Payment. All payments by Borrowers
         of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in
         Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim,
         free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative
         Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date due at the
         Funding and Payment Office for the account of Lenders; funds received
         by Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall be
         deemed to have been paid by Borrowers on the next succeeding Business
         Day. Each Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to charge its
         accounts with Administrative Agent in order to cause timely payment to
         be made to Administrative Agent of all principal, interest, fees and
         expenses due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being available in
         its accounts for that purpose). Anything contained herein to the
         contrary notwithstanding, Borrowers jointly and severally promise to
         repay all Revolving Loans and honored drawings under the Letters of
         Credit when due in accordance with the terms hereof and agree that, to
         the extent any Letters of Credit have not been returned and cancelled,
         on the Maturity Date (a) the unpaid principal amount of, and accrued
         interest on, any funded amounts under such Letters of Credit and on any
         Revolving Loans, (b) an amount equal to the maximum available amount
         that may at any time on or after such date be drawn under all such
         Letters of Credit then outstanding (whether or not any beneficiary
         under any such Letter of Credit shall have presented, or shall be
         entitled at such time to present, the drafts or other documents or
         certificates required to draw under such Letter of Credit), and (c) all
         other Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and
         payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other requirements of
         any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrowers, and
         any amounts so due and payable with respect to Letters of Credit shall
         be cash collateralized in an amount equal to 105% of the amount
         thereof.

                  (ii)     Application of Payments to Principal and Interest.
         All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Revolving Loan
         or any honored drawing under a Letter of Credit shall include payment
         of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid,
         and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of
         any Revolving Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with
         respect to such Revolving Loan) shall be applied to the payment of
         interest before application to principal.

                  (iii)    Apportionment of Payments. Aggregate payments of
         principal and interest shall be apportioned among all outstanding
         Revolving Loans to which such payments relate, in each case
         proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares. Administrative
         Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its primary address
         set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page hereof or at
         such other address as such Lender may request, its Pro Rata Share of
         all such payments received

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

         by Administrative Agent and the commitment fees and letter of credit
         fees of such Lender, if any, when received by Administrative Agent
         pursuant to subsection 2.3 and subsection 3.2. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4B(iii), if, pursuant to the
         provisions of subsection 2.6C, any Notice of Conversion/Continuation is
         withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes
         Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate
         Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning
         payments received thereafter.

                  (iv)     Payments on Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
         made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a
         Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
         Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the
         computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the commitment
         fees hereunder, as the case may be.

                  C.       APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL AND PAYMENTS
AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. Except to the extent that the Intercreditor Agreement
requires application in a different manner than as set forth in this subsection
2.4C, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default,
either if requested by Requisite Lenders or upon termination of the Commitments
(a) all Mandatory Payments or other payments received on account of the
Obligations, whether from any Borrower or otherwise, shall be applied by
Administrative Agent against the Obligations and (b) all proceeds received by
Administrative Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon all or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of
Administrative Agent, be held by Administrative Agent as Collateral for, and/or
(then or at any time thereafter) applied in full or in part by Administrative
Agent against, the applicable Secured Obligations (as defined in the Collateral
Documents), in each case in the following order of priority:

                  (i)      to the payment of all costs and expenses of such
         sale, collection or other realization, all other expenses, liabilities
         and advances made or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection
         therewith, and all amounts for which Administrative Agent is entitled
         to compensation (including the fees described in subsection 2.3),
         reimbursement and indemnification under any Credit Document and all
         advances made by Administrative Agent thereunder for the account of the
         applicable Credit Party, and to the payment of all costs and expenses
         paid or incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the Credit
         Documents, all in accordance with subsections 9.4, 10.2 and 10.3 and
         the other terms of this Agreement and the Credit Documents;

                  (ii)     thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, ratably to repay owed and outstanding amounts (subject to the
         provisions of subsection 2.4B(ii) hereof) with respect to Revolving
         Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure, with the remainder applied
         to cash collateralize Letter of Credit Exposure and unutilized Letter
         of Credit Commitments (it being understood that for purposes of
         determining the ratable portion of such excess proceeds to be applied
         to Letter of Credit Exposure, the portion of such Letter of Credit
         Exposure that consists of unutilized Letter of

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

         Credit Commitments or undrawn amounts under outstanding Letters of
         Credit shall be measured at 105% of the amount thereof), for the
         ratable benefit of the holders thereof; and

                  (iii)    thereafter, to the extent of any excess such
         proceeds, to the payment to or upon the order of such Credit Party or
         to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court
         of competent jurisdiction may direct.

         2.5.     USE OF PROCEEDS.

                  A.       REVOLVING LOANS. The proceeds of any Revolving Loans
shall be applied by Borrowers to fund working capital requirements and general
corporate purposes. Borrowers shall use the entire amount of the proceeds of
each Revolving Loan in accordance with this subsection 2.5A.

                  B.       MARGIN REGULATIONS. No portion of the proceeds of any
borrowing under this Agreement shall be used by any Borrower or any Subsidiary
of any Borrower in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the application
of such proceeds to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other regulation of such
Board or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date or
dates of such borrowing and such use of proceeds.

         2.6.     SPECIAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate
Loans as to the matters covered:

                  A.       DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. On each
Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate
that shall apply to the Eurodollar Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then
being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give
notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrowers
and each Lender.

                  B.       INABILITY TO DETERMINE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. In
the event that Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) on any Interest Rate
Determination Date that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank
Eurodollar market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
interest rate applicable to such Revolving Loans on the basis provided for in
the definition of Eurodollar Rate, Administrative Agent shall on such date give
notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrowers and
each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Revolving Loans may be made
as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until such time as Administrative
Agent notifies Borrowers and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist and (ii) any Notice

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Borrowers with
respect to the Revolving Loans in respect of which such determination was made
shall be deemed to be for a Base Rate Loan.

                  C.       ILLEGALITY OR IMPRACTICABILITY OF EURODOLLAR RATE
LOANS. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall
be made only after consultation with Borrowers and Administrative Agent) that
the making, maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has
become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any
law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would
conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order
not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would
not be unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable, or would cause such Lender
material hardship, as a result of contingencies occurring after the date of this
Agreement which materially and adversely affect the interbank Eurodollar market
or the position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such event, such
Lender shall be an "AFFECTED LENDER" and it shall on that day give notice (by
telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrowers and
Administrative Agent of such determination. Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each other Lender of the receipt of such notice. Thereafter (a) the
obligation of the Affected Lender to make Revolving Loans as, or to convert
Revolving Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice
shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such determination
by the Affected Lender relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by
Borrowers pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make such Revolving Loan as
(or convert such Revolving Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (c)
the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its outstanding Eurodollar Rate
Loans (the "AFFECTED LOANS") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the
expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected
Loans or when required by law, and (d) the Affected Loans shall automatically
convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described
above relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by Borrowers
pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation,
Borrowers shall have the option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.2D,
to rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation as to
all Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in
writing) to Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the
Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as described above.
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each other Lender of the receipt of
such notice. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing
in this subsection 2.6C shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an
Affected Lender to make or maintain Revolving Loans as, or to convert Revolving
Loans to, Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  D.       COMPENSATION FOR BREAKAGE OR NON-COMMENCEMENT OF
INTEREST PERIODS. Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, compensate each Lender
(or, if applicable, Administrative Agent), upon written request by such Person,
for all reasonable losses,

                                      -56-
<PAGE>

expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid by such Person to lenders
of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Eurodollar Rate Loans and any loss,
expense or liability sustained by such Person in connection with the liquidation
or re-employment of such funds) which such Person may sustain: (i) if for any
reason (other than a default by such Person) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a
telephonic request therefor, or a conversion to or continuation of any
Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation or a telephonic request therefor, (ii) if any prepayment
(including any prepayment or conversion occasioned by the circumstances
described in subsection 2.6C) or other principal payment or any conversion of
any of its Eurodollar Rate Loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an
Interest Period applicable to that Loan, (iii) if any prepayment of any of its
Eurodollar Rate Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of
prepayment given by Borrowers, or (iv) as a consequence of any other default by
Borrowers in the repayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans when required by the terms
of this Agreement.

         2.7.     INCREASED COSTS; TAXES; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

                  A.       COMPENSATION FOR INCREASED COSTS. Subject to the
provisions of subsection 2.4B (which shall be controlling with respect to the
matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender (including Issuing
Lender) shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that any law, treaty
or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change therein or in the
interpretation, administration or application thereof (including the
introduction of any new law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order),
or any determination of a court or other Government Authority, in each case that
becomes effective after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender with any
guideline, request or directive issued or made after the date hereof by any
central bank or other Government Authority (whether or not having the force of
law):

                  (i)      subjects such Lender to any additional Tax (other
         than any withholding tax with respect to which subsection 2.7B applies)
         with respect to this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder
         (including with respect to issuing or maintaining any Letters of Credit
         or purchasing or maintaining any participations therein or maintaining
         any Letter of Credit Commitment hereunder) or any payments to such
         Lender of principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable
         hereunder;

                  (ii)     imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
         requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in
         or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit
         extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such
         Lender (other than any such reserve or other requirements with respect
         to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of
         Eurodollar Rate); or

                  (iii)    imposes any other condition (other than with respect
         to Taxes) on or affecting such Lender or its obligations hereunder or
         the interbank Eurodollar market;

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Revolving Loans or Commitments or
agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to
purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any
amount received or receivable by such Lender with respect thereto; then, in any
such case, Borrowers shall promptly pay, on a joint and several basis, to such
Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in subsection 2.8A, such
additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender
on an after-tax basis for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts
received or receivable hereunder.

                  B.       TAXES.

                  (i)      Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by
         Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be
         paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on
         account of, any Tax imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by
         or within the United States or any political subdivision in or of the
         United States or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is
         made by or on behalf of Borrowers or by any federation or organization
         of which the United States or any such jurisdiction is a member at the
         time of payment.

                  (ii)     Grossing-up of Payments. If any Borrower or any other
         Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on
         account of any such Tax from any sum paid or payable by Borrowers to
         Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Credit Documents:

                           (a)      Borrowers shall notify Administrative Agent
                  of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement
                  as soon as Borrowers become aware of it;

                           (b)      Borrowers shall pay any such Tax when such
                  Tax is due, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay
                  is imposed on any Borrower) for their own account or (if that
                  liability is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender,
                  as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of
                  Administrative Agent or such Lender;

                           (c)      the sum payable by Borrowers in respect of
                  which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is
                  required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure
                  that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or
                  payment, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
                  be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would
                  have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment
                  been required or made; and

                           (d)      within 30 days after paying any sum from
                  which any or all of them are required by law to make any
                  deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after the due
                  date of payment of any Tax which any or all of them are

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

                  required by clause (b) above to pay, Borrowers shall deliver
                  to Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other
                  affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and
                  of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other
                  authority.

                  (iii)    Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax.

                           (a)      Each Lender that is organized under the laws
                  of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state
                  or other political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this
                  subsection 2.4B(iii), a "NON-US LENDER") shall deliver to
                  Administrative Agent and to Company, on or prior to the
                  Closing Date (in the case of any Non-U.S. Lenders listed on
                  the signatures pages hereto on the date hereof) or on or prior
                  to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it
                  becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Non-U.S. Lender),
                  and at such other times as may be necessary in the
                  determination of Company or Administrative Agent (each in the
                  reasonable exercise of its discretion), two original copies of
                  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any
                  successor forms) properly completed and duly executed by such
                  Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of
                  exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code or the
                  regulations issued thereunder to establish that such Lender is
                  not subject to United States withholding tax with respect to
                  any payments to such Lender of interest payable under any of
                  the Credit Documents.

                           (b)      Each Non-US Lender hereby agrees, from time
                  to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such
                  forms, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances
                  renders such forms, certificates or other evidence so
                  delivered obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that
                  such Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent
                  and to Company two original copies of renewals, amendments or
                  additional or successor forms, properly completed and duly
                  executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate
                  or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or
                  establish that such Lender is not subject to United States
                  withholding tax with respect to payments to such Lender under
                  the Credit Documents or (2) notify Administrative Agent and
                  Company of its inability to deliver any such forms,
                  certificates or other evidence.

                           (c)      Borrowers shall not be required to pay any
                  additional amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of
                  subsection 2.7B(ii) if such Lender shall have failed to
                  satisfy the requirements of clause (a) or (b)(1) of this
                  subsection 2.7B(iii); provided, that if such Lender shall have
                  satisfied the requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on the
                  date such Lender became a Lender, nothing in this subsection
                  2.7B(iii)(c) shall relieve Borrowers of their obligation to
                  pay any amounts pursuant to subsection 2.7B(ii)(c) in the
                  event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law,
                  treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
                  change in the interpretation, administration or

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

                  application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly
                  entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a
                  subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not
                  subject to withholding as described in subsection
                  2.7B(iii)(a).

                  (iv)     Indemnity for Withheld Amounts. Borrowers hereby
         agree to indemnify Lenders and Administrative Agent for the full amount
         of any deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes imposed,
         levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States
         or any political subdivision in or of the United States or any other
         jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made by or on behalf of
         Borrowers or by any federation or organization of which the United
         States or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment
         (including any such Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
         payable under this subsection 2.7B) that Borrowers are required to pay
         pursuant to subsection 2.7B(ii) but were paid by Administrative Agent
         or Lenders with respect to sums payable by Borrowers under this
         Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any liability (including
         penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
         thereto. This indemnification shall be made promptly, and in any event
         within 10 days after, the relevant Lender or Administrative Agent makes
         demand therefor in writing.

                  C.       CAPITAL ADEQUACY ADJUSTMENT. If any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption, effectiveness, phase-in or applicability after the
date hereof of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Government Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any
guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such Government Authority, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to,
such Lender's Revolving Loans, Commitments, Letters of Credit, participations
therein or other Obligations to a level below that which such Lender or such
controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
effectiveness, phase-in, applicability, change or compliance (taking into
consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with
regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, within 5 Business Days
after receipt by Borrowers from such Lender of the statement referred to in
subsection 2.8A, Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation on an
after-tax basis for such reduction.

         2.8.     STATEMENT OF LENDERS; OBLIGATION OF LENDERS AND ISSUING LENDER
                  TO MITIGATE.

                  A.       STATEMENTS. Each Lender claiming compensation or
reimbursement pursuant to subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 2.8B shall deliver to Company
(with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such compensation or
reimbursement, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties
hereto absent manifest error; provided, that a Lender claiming

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

compensation or reimbursement pursuant to subsection 2.7B(ii) due to
circumstances in effect as of the Closing Date shall not be required to deliver
more than one such statement to Borrowers or Administrative Agent, and such
statement shall remain effective with respect to this Agreement until all
Obligations have been paid in full.

                  B.       MITIGATION. Each Lender (including Issuing Lender)
agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of such Lender or
Issuing Lender responsible for administering the Revolving Loans or Letters of
Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, becomes aware of
the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition that would entitle
such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.4 (other
than subsection 2.7B(ii)), it will use reasonable efforts to make, issue, fund
or maintain the Letter of Credit Commitments of such Lender or the Revolving
Loans or Letters of Credit of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another
lending or letter of credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender, if (i) as a
result thereof the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be
paid to such Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 would be
materially reduced and (ii) as determined by such Lender or Issuing Lender in
its sole discretion, such action would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender or Issuing Lender; provided, that such Lender or Issuing Lender will not
be obligated to utilize such other lending or letter of credit office pursuant
to this subsection 2.8B unless Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several
basis, all incremental expenses incurred by such Lender or Issuing Lender as a
result of utilizing such other lending or letter of credit office as described
above.

         2.9.     DEFAULTING LENDER

                  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in
the event that any Lender (any such Lender being a "DEFAULTING LENDER") defaults
(a "FUNDING DEFAULT") in its obligation to fund its participation in any Letter
of Credit (a "DEFAULTED PARTICIPATION") or to fund any Revolving Loan (a
"DEFAULTED LOAN") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then (i)
during any Default Period (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting
Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed a "Lender" for purposes of
voting on any matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers) with
respect to any of the Credit Documents (provided, however, that nothing in this
clause (i) shall be construed as permitting, without the consent of the relevant
Defaulting Lender, a reduction in the principal amount of such Defaulting
Lender's funded Revolving Loans or other outstanding funded Obligations, an
increase in the amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment or Letter of
Credit Commitment or participation in any Letters of Credit, a reduction or
postponement of the due date of any amount funded by such Defaulting Lender and
payable in respect of any Letter of Credit, an extension of the expiration date
of any Letter of Credit beyond the Maturity Date, or an extension of the
Maturity Date), (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, until such time
as the Default Excess (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender
shall have been reduced to zero, any payment of amounts with respect to the
Revolving Loans and any payment or reimbursement of amounts with respect to a
drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be applied first, to amounts funded by
Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or other Lenders (together with unpaid
interest accrued thereon) in lieu of such amounts required to be funded by
Defaulting

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

Lenders and second, to the Revolving Loans or Letter of Credit participations,
as the case may be, of other Lenders (other than any other Defaulting Lenders)
as if such Defaulting Lender (and any other Defaulting Lenders) had no Revolving
Loans outstanding and the Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero,
(iii) such Defaulting Lender's Commitments, Revolving Loans and Pro Rata Share
with respect thereto shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the
commitment fee in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to
such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender's Commitments, Revolving Loans
and Pro Rata Shares with respect thereto shall be excluded for purposes of
calculating the letter of credit fees under subsection 3.2 in respect of any day
during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such
Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any such commitment fee or
letter of credit fee with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Commitments in
respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and (iv)
the Credit Utilization as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if
such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Loans of such Defaulting Lender.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, (I) "DEFAULT PERIOD" means,
with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the period commencing on the date of the
applicable Funding Default and ending on the earliest of the following dates:
(A) the date on which all Commitments are cancelled or terminated and/or the
Obligations are declared or become immediately due and payable, (B) the date on
which (1) the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have
been reduced to zero (whether by the funding by such Defaulting Lender of any
Defaulted Loans or Defaulted Participations, as the case may be, of such
Defaulting Lender or by the non-pro rata application of any payments of amounts
with respect to the Revolving Loans or any payments or reimbursements of amounts
with respect to drawings under Letters of Credit in accordance with the terms
hereof or any combination thereof), and (2) such Defaulting Lender shall have
delivered to Company and Administrative Agent a written reaffirmation of its
intention to honor its obligations under this Agreement with respect to its
Commitments, and (C) the date on which Company, Administrative Agent and Issuing
Lender waive all Funding Defaults of such Defaulting Lender in writing, and (II)
"DEFAULT EXCESS" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the excess, if
any, of (x) such Defaulting Lender's applicable Pro Rata Share of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of all Lenders and all funded
participations in Letters of Credit of Lenders (calculated as if all Defaulting
Lenders (other than such Defaulting Lender) had funded all of their respective
Defaulted Loans and Defaulted Participations) over (y) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender and the aggregate
funded amount of such Defaulting Lender's participations in Letters of Credit.

                  No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise
affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 2.9,
performance by any Borrower of its obligations under this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result
of any Funding Default or the operation of this subsection 2.9. The rights and
remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this subsection 2.9 are in addition
to other rights and remedies that Borrowers may have against such Defaulting
Lender with respect to any Funding Default and that Administrative Agent,

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

Issuing Lender or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with
respect to any Funding Default.

         2.10.    JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; PAYMENT INDEMNIFICATIONS.

                  A.       JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. All Obligations of
Borrowers under the Credit Documents shall be the joint and several Obligations
of each Borrower.

                  B.       NO IMPAIRMENT OR RELEASE. The Obligations of and the
Liens granted by any Borrower under the Credit Documents shall not be impaired
or released by any action or inaction on the part of Administrative Agent or any
Lender with respect to any other Credit Party, including any action or inaction
which would otherwise release a surety.

                  C.       CONTRIBUTION RIGHTS. In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution among Borrowers if any payment is made by a Borrower (a
"FUNDING BORROWER") in discharging any of the Obligations, that Funding Borrower
shall be entitled to a contribution from the other Borrowers for all payments,
damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Borrower in discharging the
Obligations, in the manner and to the extent required to allocate liabilities in
an equitable manner among Borrowers on the basis of the relative benefits
received by Borrowers. If and to the extent that a Funding Borrower makes any
payment to any Lender or any other Person in respect of the Obligations, any
claim which said Funding Borrower may have against the other Borrowers by reason
thereof shall be subject and subordinate to the prior cash payment in full of
the Obligations. The parties hereto acknowledge that the right to contribution
hereunder shall constitute an asset of the party to which such contribution is
owing and shall be subject to the Liens and security interests of the
Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, such
contribution arrangements shall not limit in any manner the joint and several
nature of the Obligations, limit, release or otherwise impair any rights of
Administrative Agent or any Lender under the Credit Documents, or alter, limit
or impair the obligation of each Borrower, which is absolute and unconditional,
to repay the Obligations.

         2.11.    RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC.

                  Except as prohibited under applicable law, Company hereby
waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that Company now has or
may hereafter have against any other Borrower or any guarantor of the
Obligations in connection with this Agreement or the performance by Company of
its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy
arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and
including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that
Company now has or may hereafter have against any other Borrower or guarantor of
the Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim,
right or remedy that Administrative Agent or any Lender now has or may hereafter
have against any other Borrower or guarantor of the Obligations, and (c) any
benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or
hereafter held by Administrative Agent or any Lender. In addition, until the
Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and all Commitments shall
have terminated and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been cancelled,
Company shall

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

withhold exercise of any right of contribution Company may have against any
other Borrower or Credit Party. Company further agrees that, to the extent the
waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation,
reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any
rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification Company may have against
any other Borrower or Credit Party or against any collateral or security shall
be junior and subordinate to any rights Administrative Agent or any Lender may
have against any other Borrower, to all right, title and interest Administrative
Agent or any Lender may have in any such collateral or security, and to any
right Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Credit Party. If
any amount shall be paid to Company on account of any such subrogation,
reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time when all
Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust
for Administrative Agent on behalf of Administrative Agent and Lenders and shall
forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Administrative
Agent and Lenders to be credited and applied against the Obligations, whether
matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.

SECTION 3 LETTERS OF CREDIT

         3.1.     LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS; ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT
                  AND LENDERS' PURCHASE OF PARTICIPATIONS THEREIN.

                  A.       LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  Borrowers may request, in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection 3.1, from time to time during the period from the Closing Date
to but excluding the 30th day prior to the Maturity Date, that Issuing Lender
issue Letters of Credit for the account of Borrowers (in the case of Closing
Date Letters of Credit, for the purposes of supporting obligations of the type
set forth on Schedule 3.1A(i) annexed hereto, and, in the case of all other
Letters of Credit, for the purposes described in subsection 3.1B(ii)(b)). The
original amount of each Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment is set forth
opposite its name on Schedule 2.1 annexed hereto and the aggregate original
amount of the Letter of Credit Commitments is $118,000,000; provided, however,
that the Letter of Credit Commitments of Lenders shall be adjusted to give
effect to any assignments of the Letter of Credit Commitments pursuant to
subsection 10.1B and shall be reduced from time to time by the amount of any
reductions thereto made pursuant to subsection 2.4. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Borrowers shall not request that Issuing Lender issue
(and Issuing Lender shall not issue) any Letter of Credit:

                           (a)      if, after giving effect to such issuance,
                  the aggregate Credit Utilization would exceed the aggregate
                  Letter of Credit Commitments then in effect;

                           (b)      with respect to Closing Date Letters of
                  Credit only, if the obligations to be supported by such Letter
                  of Credit are not of a type identified on Schedule 3.1A(i)
                  annexed hereto;

                                      -64-
<PAGE>

                           (c)      with respect to Closing Date Letters of
                  Credit only, if, after giving effect to such issuance, the
                  maximum aggregate amount which is or at any time thereafter
                  may be available for drawing under Letters of Credit issued to
                  support an obligation of a type identified on Schedule 3.1A(i)
                  annexed hereto would exceed the correlative amount set forth
                  for such obligation on such Schedule (as such amount may be
                  reduced from time to time pursuant to subsection 2.4A(v));

                           (d)      having an expiration date later than the
                  earlier of (a) the 5th Business Day prior to the Maturity Date
                  and (b) the date which is three years from the date of
                  issuance of such Letter of Credit; provided that the
                  immediately preceding clause (b) shall not prevent Issuing
                  Lender from agreeing that a Letter of Credit will
                  automatically be extended to a date not later than the 5th
                  Business Day prior to the Maturity Date unless Issuing Lender
                  elects not to extend for any such additional period; and
                  provided, further that Issuing Lender shall elect not to
                  extend such Letter of Credit if it has knowledge that an Event
                  of Default has occurred and is continuing (and has not been
                  waived in accordance with subsection 10.6) at the time Issuing
                  Lender must elect whether or not to allow such extension (with
                  it being agreed and understood that Issuing Lender shall
                  provide Borrowers with prompt notice of any such extension of
                  a Letter of Credit having been denied); or

                           (e)      denominated in a currency other than
                  Dollars.

                  B.       MECHANICS OF ISSUANCES.

                  (i)      Issuance of Closing Date Letters of Credit on the
         Closing Date. Issuing Lender shall, on or about the Closing Date, issue
         the Closing Date Letters of Credit as follows: (1) Issuing Lender shall
         issue the Montgomery Letter of Credit, (2) Issuing Lender shall issue
         the Back-Up Closing Date Letters of Credit and (3) Issuing Lender shall
         issue the Replacement Closing Date Letters of Credit upon Issuing
         Lender's receipt of evidence satisfactory to it that the DIP Tranche A
         L/Cs and DIP Tranche B L/Cs being replaced by such Replacement Closing
         Date Letters of Credit are concurrently therewith being returned
         undrawn and cancelled.

                  (ii)     Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit.

                           (a)      Letters of Credit to Replace Closing Date
                  Letters of Credit. After the issuance of any Closing Date
                  Letter of Credit, whenever Borrowers desire to have Issuing
                  Lender issue a Letter of Credit to extend or replace such
                  outstanding Closing Date Letter of Credit (or, in the case of
                  a Back-Up Closing Date Letter of Credit, to replace such
                  Back-Up Closing Date Letter of Credit and the corresponding
                  DIP Tranche A L/C or DIP Tranche B L/C), or Administrative
                  Agent requests (with a copy of such request to Company) that
                  Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit to extend or to
                  replace such outstanding Closing Date Letter of Credit (or, in
                  the case of a Back-Up Closing Date Letter

                                      -65-
<PAGE>

                  of Credit, to replace such Back-Up Closing Date Letter of
                  Credit and the corresponding DIP Tranche A L/C or DIP Tranche
                  B L/C), Borrowers shall deliver to Issuing Lender (and
                  Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such
                  Issuing Lender) a Request for Issuance no later than 12:00
                  Noon (Chicago time) at least 10 Business Days (or in each case
                  such shorter period as may be agreed to by Administrative
                  Agent in any particular instance) in advance of the proposed
                  date of issuance, which Request for Issuance shall describe
                  the relevant Closing Date Letter of Credit and the verbatim
                  text of the Letter of Credit proposed to be issued or of such
                  extension, as the case may be, and shall specify such proposed
                  date of issuance or extension; provided, that Borrowers shall
                  not request that Issuing Lender issue or extend (and Issuing
                  Lender shall not issue or extend) any such Letter of Credit:

                           (1)      if the underlying Contractual Obligation to
                  provide any such Closing Date Letter of Credit or a
                  replacement thereto to the beneficiary thereof (or, in the
                  case of a Back-Up Closing Date Letter of Credit, the
                  beneficiary of the DIP Tranche A L/C or DIP Tranche B L/C to
                  which such Back-Up Closing Date Letter of Credit corresponds)
                  has terminated, and/or the beneficiary of such Closing Date
                  Letter of Credit (or, in the case of a Back-Up Closing Date
                  Letter of Credit, the beneficiary of the DIP Tranche A L/C or
                  DIP Tranche B L/C to which such Back-Up Closing Date Letter of
                  Credit corresponds) has otherwise returned the same for
                  cancellation without the expectation that a Letter of Credit
                  will be issued contemporaneously with such cancellation in
                  substitution therefor;

                           (2)      if the terms of such Letter of Credit as so
                  replaced or extended (other than the stated amount and
                  expiration date thereof) are not substantially identical to
                  the terms of the corresponding Closing Date Letter of Credit
                  being replaced or extended (it being agreed and understood
                  that any such Letter of Credit issued to replace a Back-Up
                  Closing Date Letter of Credit and the DIP Tranche A L/C or DIP
                  Tranche B L/C to which it corresponds shall have as its
                  beneficiary the beneficiary of such DIP Tranche A L/C or DIP
                  Tranche B L/C but shall otherwise comply with the requirements
                  of this clause (2)); or

                           (3)      if the stated amount of such Letter of
                  Credit as so replaced or extended exceeds the stated amount of
                  the corresponding Closing Date Letter of Credit being replaced
                  or extended, as the case may be.

                           (b)      Letters of Credit Not to Replace Closing
                  Date Letters of Credit. Whenever Borrowers desire the issuance
                  of a Letter of Credit (other than a Closing Date Letter of
                  Credit), they shall deliver to Issuing Lender (and
                  Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such
                  Issuing Lender) a Request for Issuance no later than 12:00
                  Noon (Chicago time) at least 10 Business Days, or in each case
                  such shorter period as may be agreed to by Administrative
                  Agent in any particular instance, in advance of the proposed
                  date of issuance. Upon receipt by Issuing Lender (and
                  Administrative Agent,

                                      -66-

                  if Administrative Agent is not such Issuing Lender) of a
                  Request for Issuance pursuant to this subsection 3.1B(ii)(b)
                  requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Issuing Lender
                  shall be the Issuing Lender with respect thereto. In respect
                  of a Letter of Credit requested pursuant to this subsection
                  3.1B(ii)(b), Issuing Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may
                  require changes in the text of a proposed Letter of Credit or
                  any documents described in or attached to the relevant Request
                  for Issuance so long as any such changes do not conflict with
                  the applicable requirements of the Contractual Obligation to
                  provide such Letter of Credit. Letters of Credit requested
                  pursuant to this subsection 3.1B(ii)(b) shall be used solely
                  for general corporate purposes. No Letter of Credit requested
                  pursuant to this subsection 3.1B(ii)(b) shall require payment
                  against a conforming demand for payment to be made thereunder
                  on the same Business Day (under the laws of the jurisdiction
                  in which the office of Issuing Lender to which such demand for
                  payment is required to be presented is located) that such
                  demand for payment is presented if such presentation is made
                  after 10:00 A.M. (in the time zone of such office of Issuing
                  Lender) on such Business Day.

                  (iii)    Recertification. Borrowers shall notify Issuing
         Lender (and Administrative Agent, if Administrative Agent is not such
         Issuing Lender) prior to the issuance or extension of any Letter of
         Credit in the event that any of the matters to which Borrowers are
         required to certify in the applicable Request for Issuance is no longer
         true and correct as of the proposed date of issuance or extension of
         such Letter of Credit, and upon the issuance or extension of any Letter
         of Credit Borrowers shall be deemed to have re-certified, as of the
         date of such issuance or extension, as to the matters to which
         Borrowers are required to certify in the applicable Request for
         Issuance (except to the extent such requirement to re-certify as to
         such matters shall have been waived in accordance with subsection 10.6
         hereof).

                  (iv)     Issuance of Letter of Credit. Upon satisfaction or
         waiver (in accordance with subsection 10.6) of the conditions set forth
         in subsection 4.3, Issuing Lender shall issue the requested Letter of
         Credit in accordance with Issuing Lender's standard operating
         procedures.

                  (v)      Notification to Lenders. No later than 10 Business
         Days prior to the decision to extend or reissue any Letter of Credit,
         Issuing Lender shall notify Administrative Agent in writing of the date
         on which Issuing Lender expects such decision will be made and of the
         date by which such decision must be made in order to avoid a drawing
         under such Letter of Credit. Promptly after the issuance, amendment or
         extension of any Letter of Credit Issuing Lender shall promptly notify
         Administrative Agent and each Lender of such issuance, amendment or
         extension in writing. Upon receipt of such notice (or, if
         Administrative Agent is the Issuing Lender, together with such notice),
         Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender in writing of the amount
         of such Lender's respective participation in such Letter of Credit,
         determined in accordance with subsection 3.1C and, if so requested by a

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

         Lender, Administrative Agent shall provide such Lender with a copy of
         such Letter of Credit, amendment or extension.

                  C.       LENDERS' PURCHASE OF PARTICIPATIONS IN LETTERS OF
CREDIT. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Letter of
Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably
purchased from Issuing Lender a participation in such Letter of Credit and any
drawings honored thereunder in an amount equal to such Letter of Credit Lender's
Pro Rata Share (with respect to Letter of Credit Exposure) of the maximum amount
which is or at any time may become available to be drawn thereunder.

         3.2.     LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

                  Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay,

                  (i)      with respect to each Letter of Credit, a letter of
         credit fee, payable to Administrative Agent for the account of
         Administrative Agent and Lenders (with the allocation among
         Administrative Agent and Lenders to be as set forth in the Inter-Lender
         Agreement and the allocation among Lenders to be in proportion to their
         respective Pro Rata Shares), equal to 6.50% per annum (expressed as a
         daily rate) multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under
         such Letter of Credit, each such letter of credit fee to be payable in
         arrears on and to (but excluding) the last day of each fiscal quarter
         and computed on the basis of a 360-day year, for the actual number of
         days elapsed, and

                  (ii)     with respect to the issuance, negotiation, amendment
         or transfer of each Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made
         thereunder (without duplication of the fees payable under clause (i)
         above), Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay customary
         processing documentation and other like charges payable directly to
         Issuing Lender (and, if applicable, to any confirming bank) for its own
         account in accordance with Issuing Lender's (and, if applicable, such
         confirming bank's) standard schedule for such charges in effect at the
         time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may
         be.

                  For purposes of calculating any fees payable under this
subsection 3.2, the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of
determination. Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount
described in clause (ii) of this subsection 3.2 with respect to a Letter of
Credit, Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share
of such amount. All fees referenced in this subsection 3.2 shall be earned when
payable and shall be non-refundable. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of any Event of Default and notice from Administrative Agent to
Borrowers, all fees set forth in this subsection 3.2 shall accrue at a rate that
is 2.00% per annum in excess of the rate otherwise set forth in this subsection
and shall, if Administrative Agent so requests, be payable upon demand. Payment
or acceptance of the increased rates provided for in this paragraph shall not

                                      -68-
<PAGE>

constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any
rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

         3.3.     DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF
                  CREDIT.

                  A.       RESPONSIBILITY OF ISSUING LENDER WITH RESPECT TO
DRAWINGS. In determining whether to honor any drawing under any Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary thereof, Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to examine
the documents delivered under such Letter of Credit with reasonable care so as
to ascertain whether they appear on their face to be in compliance with the
terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

                  B.       REIMBURSEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF
CREDIT. In the event Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a
Letter of Credit issued by it, Issuing Lender shall immediately notify Borrowers
and Borrowers shall reimburse Issuing Lender on or before the Business Day
immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the
"REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars and in same day funds equal to the
amount of such payment.

                  C.       PAYMENT BY LENDERS OF UNREIMBURSED AMOUNTS PAID UNDER
LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (i)      Payment by Lenders. In the event that Borrowers shall
         fail for any reason to reimburse Issuing Lender as provided in
         subsection 3.3B in an amount equal to the amount of any payment by
         Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, Issuing Lender
         shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of the unreimbursed amount
         of such drawing and upon receipt of such notice, Administrative Agent
         shall promptly notify each Lender (other than Issuing Lender) of such
         unreimbursed amount and of such Lender's respective participation
         therein based on such Lender's Pro Rata Share; provided, that no
         Lender's funding of its participation in any such drawing shall exceed
         its Pro Rata Share of the amount of such drawing, and the aggregate
         principal amount of all participations funded by a Lender with respect
         to Letters of Credit shall in no event exceed the amount of such
         Lender's Letter of Credit Commitment. Each Lender shall make available
         to Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective participation, in
         Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of Issuing Lender
         specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on
         the first Business Day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
         such office of Issuing Lender is located) after the date notified by
         Administrative Agent. In the event that any Lender fails to make
         available to Issuing Lender on such Business Day the amount of such
         Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this
         subsection 3.3C, Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such
         amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the
         rate customarily used by Issuing Lender for the correction of errors
         among banks for 3 Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.
         Nothing in this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right
         of any Lender to recover from Issuing Lender any amounts made available
         by such Lender to Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.3C in
         the

                                      -69-
<PAGE>

         event that it is determined by the final judgment of a court of
         competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of
         Credit by Issuing Lender in respect of which payment was made by such
         Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
         of Issuing Lender.

                  (ii)     Distribution to Lenders of Reimbursements Received
         From Borrowers. In the event Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed
         by other Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion
         of any payment by Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it,
         Issuing Lender shall deliver to Administrative Agent for distribution
         to any other Lender that has paid all amounts payable by it under
         subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such payment such other Lender's Pro
         Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by Issuing Lender from
         Borrowers in reimbursement of such payment under the Letter of Credit
         when such payments are received. Any such distribution shall be made to
         a Lender at its primary address set forth below its name on the
         appropriate signature page hereof or at such other address as such
         Lender may request.

                  D.       INTEREST ON AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (i)      Payment of Interest by Borrowers. Borrowers agree to
         pay to Issuing Lender, with respect to payments under any Letters of
         Credit issued by it, interest on the amount paid by such Issuing Lender
         in respect of each such payment from the date a drawing is honored to
         but excluding the date such amount is reimbursed by Borrowers at a rate
         equal to (1) for the period from the date such drawing is honored to
         but excluding the Reimbursement Date, the Base Rate plus the Base Rate
         Margin per annum and (2) thereafter, a rate which is 2% per annum in
         excess of the rate of interest set forth in the foregoing clause
         (i)(1). Interest payable pursuant to this subsection 3.3D(i) shall be
         computed on the basis of a 360-day year, for the actual number of days
         elapsed in the period during which it accrues and shall be payable on
         demand or, if no demand is made, on the date on which the related
         drawing under a Letter of Credit is reimbursed in full. All payments by
         Borrowers in respect of payments made by Issuing Lender under a Letter
         of Credit issued by it shall include payment of accrued interest on the
         principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments shall
         be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal.
         Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for
         in this subsection 3.3D is not a permitted alternative to timely
         payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or
         otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative
         Agent or any Lender.

                  (ii)     Distribution of Interest Payments by Issuing Lender.
         Promptly upon receipt by Issuing Lender of any payment of interest
         pursuant to subsection 3.3D(i) with respect to a payment under a Letter
         of Credit issued by it, (a) such Issuing Lender shall distribute to
         Administrative Agent for distribution to each other Lender, out of the
         interest received by Issuing Lender in respect of the period from the
         date such drawing is honored to but excluding the date on which Issuing
         Lender is reimbursed for the amount of such payment, the amount that
         such other Lender would

                                      -70-
<PAGE>

         have been entitled to receive in respect of the letter of credit fee
         that would have been payable in respect of such Letter of Credit for
         such period pursuant to subsection 3.2 if no drawing had been honored
         under such Letter of Credit, and (b) in the event Issuing Lender shall
         have been reimbursed by other Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i)
         for all or any portion of such payment, Issuing Lender shall distribute
         to Administrative Agent for distribution to each other Lender that has
         paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to
         such payment such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of any interest
         received by Issuing Lender in respect of that portion of such payment
         so reimbursed by other Lenders for the period from the date on which
         Issuing Lender was so reimbursed by other Lenders to but excluding the
         date on which such portion of such payment is reimbursed by Borrowers.
         Any such distribution shall be made to a Lender at its primary address
         set forth below its name on the appropriate signature page hereof or at
         such other address as such Lender may request.

         3.4.     OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE.

                  The obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing Lender for
payments under the Letters of Credit issued by it and the obligations of Lenders
under subsection 3.3C(i) shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be
paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances including any of the following circumstances:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
         of Credit;

                  (ii)     the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
         right which any Borrower or any Lender may have at any time against a
         beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons
         for whom any such transferee may be acting), Issuing Lender or other
         Lender or any other Person or, in the case of a Lender, against any
         Borrower, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
         contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any
         underlying transaction between any Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries
         and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);

                  (iii)    any draft or other document presented under any
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv)     payment by Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft or other document which does not
         substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                  (v)      any adverse change in the business, operations,
         properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries);

                                      -71-
<PAGE>

                  (vi)     any breach of this Agreement or any other Credit
         Document by any party thereto;

                  (vii)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
         whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; or

                  (viii)   the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential
         Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

provided, in each case, that payment by Issuing Lender under the applicable
Letter of Credit shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Issuing Lender under the circumstances in question (as determined
by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

         3.5.     NATURE OF ISSUING LENDER'S DUTIES.

                  A.       INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to amounts payable as
provided in subsection 2.7, Borrowers hereby jointly and severally agree to
protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless Issuing Lender from and against any
and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and
expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of outside
counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which Issuing Lender may incur
or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of
any Letter of Credit by Issuing Lender, other than as a result of (a) the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender as determined by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following
clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor by Issuing Lender of a proper demand for
payment made under any Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of
Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of
any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de
jure or de facto Government Authority.

                  B.       NATURE OF ISSUING LENDER'S DUTIES. As between
Borrowers and Issuing Lender, Borrowers assume all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing Lender by,
the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i)
the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and
issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;
(ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of
any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order
to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or
delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph,
telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in
interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or
otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such
Letter of

                                      -72-
<PAGE>

Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary
of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of
Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of
Issuing Lender, including any act or omission by a Government Authority
specified in subsection 3.5A, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or
prevent the vesting of, any of Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B,
any action taken or omitted by Issuing Lender under or in connection with the
Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put Issuing Lender
under any resulting liability to any Borrower.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
subsection 3.5, Borrowers shall retain any and all rights they may have against
Issuing Lender for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Issuing Lender, as determined by a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

         3.6.     CASH COLLATERAL FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  A.       RELEASES OF CASH COLLATERAL. If (i) (a) the
underlying Contractual Obligation to provide a Letter of Credit or a replacement
thereto to the beneficiary thereof has terminated (other than by drawing under
such Letter of Credit), and/or (b) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit has
otherwise returned the same for cancellation without the expectation that a
Letter of Credit will be issued contemporaneously with such cancellation in
substitution for such cancelled Letter of Credit, and/or the maximum amount
available for drawing under a Letter of Credit is permanently reduced (other
than such a reduction concurrently with a reissuance or replacement of the
relevant reduced portion of a Closing Date Letter of Credit pursuant to
subsection 3.1(B)(ii)(a)), and (ii) the Letter of Credit Commitments are
permanently reduced by the amount of such Letter of Credit or such reduction in
the stated amount of such Letter of Credit, as the case may be, then, to the
extent that the amount of cash collateral securing the Letter of Credit Exposure
pursuant to the Collateral Account Agreement exceeds 105% of the Letter of
Credit Commitments then in effect after such permanent reduction, the excess
cash collateral shall be applied to the payment to or upon the order of
Borrowers or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a
court of competent jurisdiction may direct, except to the extent that the
Intercreditor Agreement requires application in a different manner than as set
forth in this subsection 3.6A.

                  B.       CASH COLLATERAL ON THE MATURITY DATE. On the Maturity
Date, any outstanding Letter of Credit Exposure shall be cash collateralized in
an amount equal to 105% of the amount thereof by Borrowers or otherwise
supported, in either case in a manner satisfactory to the Lenders.

conditions precedent described in subsection 4.2B (other than subdivision (iv)
thereof) shall be satisfied to the same extent as if the issuance of such Letter
of Credit were the making of a Revolving Loan and the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit were a Funding Date.

<PAGE>

         5.1.     ORGANIZATION, POWERS, QUALIFICATION, GOOD STANDING, BUSINESS
                  AND SUBSIDIARIES.

                  A.       ORGANIZATION AND POWERS. Each Credit Party is a
corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization as specified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto (provided, however,
that failure of any Credit Party to be in good standing in the relevant
jurisdiction shall not be deemed a breach of this representation if (x) such
failure is due solely to failure to pay franchise taxes and (y) full payment of
such franchise taxes has been tendered no later than the date which is 90 days
after the Closing Date). Each Credit Party has all requisite power and authority
to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, to enter into the Credit Documents to which it is a
party and to carry out the transactions contemplated thereby. Each Credit Party
is in compliance with all material terms of its Organizational Documents.

                  B.       QUALIFICATION AND GOOD STANDING. Each Credit Party is
qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction necessary to
carry out its business and operations, except in jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  C.       CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. Company and its Subsidiaries are
engaged only in the businesses permitted to be engaged in pursuant to subsection
7.11.

                  D.       SUBSIDIARIES. All of the Subsidiaries of Company as
of the Closing Date and their jurisdictions of organization are identified in
Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto. The Capital Stock of each of the Subsidiaries of
Company identified in Schedule 5.1 annexed hereto is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and none of such Capital Stock constitutes
Margin Stock. Each of the Subsidiaries of Company identified in Schedule 5.1
annexed hereto is a corporation, partnership, trust or limited liability company
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization set forth therein, has all requisite
power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is qualified to
do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction necessary to carry out
its business and operations, in each case except where failure to be so
qualified or in good standing or a lack of such power and authority has not had
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule
5.1 annexed hereto correctly sets forth, as of the Closing Date, the ownership
interest of Company and each of its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries of
Company identified therein.

         5.2.     AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING, ETC.

                  A.       AUTHORIZATION OF BORROWING. The execution, delivery
and performance of the Credit Documents have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of each Credit Party that is a party thereto.

<PAGE>

                  B.       NO CONFLICT. The execution, delivery and performance
by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do not and
will not (i) violate any provision of any law or any governmental rule or
regulation applicable to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Organizational
Documents of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any order, judgment or decree
of any court or other Government Authority binding on Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any Contractual Obligation of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, other than any Liens created under any of the Credit Documents
in favor of Collateral Agent on behalf of Secured Parties, or (iv) require any
approval of stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person under any
Contractual Obligation of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for (x)
such approvals or consents which will be obtained on or before the Closing Date
and disclosed in writing to Lenders.

                  C.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. The execution, delivery and
performance by Credit Parties of the Credit Documents to which they are parties
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents do
not and will not require any Governmental Authorization, except for the entry of
the Confirmation Order and except for filings expressly contemplated by the
Credit Documents and those Governmental Authorizations which have been obtained.

                  D.       BINDING OBLIGATION. Each of the Credit Documents has
been duly executed and delivered by each Credit Party that is a party thereto
and is the legally valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party,
enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with its respective terms,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally or by
equitable principles relating to enforceability.

                  E.       RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. There are no restrictions
on any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which prohibit or otherwise restrict
the transfer of cash or other assets from one to another, other than (i)
prohibitions or restrictions existing under or by reason of (a) this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, (b) applicable law, (c) customary non-assignment
provisions entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices, and (d) any documents or instruments governing the terms of any
Indebtedness or other obligations secured by Liens permitted by subsection 7.2A,
provided, that such prohibitions or restrictions apply only to the assets
subject to such Liens, and (ii) restrictions described in clauses (a) through
(d) of subsection 7.2D.

         5.3.     FINANCIAL CONDITION.

                  Company has heretofore delivered to Lenders, at Lenders'
request, (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of Company and its
Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2002 and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal
Quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003

                                      -88-
<PAGE>

and September 30, 2003. All such statements were prepared in conformity with
GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position (on a
consolidated and, where applicable, consolidating basis) of the entities
described in such financial statements as at the respective dates thereof and
the results of operations and cash flows (on a consolidated and, where
applicable, consolidating basis) of the entities described therein for each of
the periods then ended, subject, in the case of any such unaudited financial
statements, to changes resulting from audit and normal year-end adjustments. No
Borrower has, as of the Closing Date, any Contingent Obligation, contingent
liability or unusual long-term commitment that is not reflected in the foregoing
financial statements or the notes thereto and, as of any Funding Date subsequent
to the Closing Date, is not reflected in the most recent financial statements
delivered to Lenders pursuant to subsection 6.1 or the notes thereto (other than
(a) those liabilities reflected on the Schedules to this Agreement and (b)
Performance Guaranties and Contingent Obligations that are permitted to be
incurred under subsection 7.4) and that, in any such case, is material in
relation to the business, operations, properties, assets or financial condition
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

         5.4.     NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE; NO RESTRICTED PAYMENTS.

                  Since December 31, 2002, no event or change has occurred
(other than as disclosed in reports delivered pursuant to subsection 6.1(i) of
the DIP Credit Agreement) that has resulted in or evidences, either in any case
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Since the Petition Date, neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has directly or indirectly declared,
ordered, paid or made, or set apart any sum or property for, any Restricted
Payment or agreed to do so except (i) as permitted by subsection 7.5, and (ii)
as was permitted by subsection 7.5 of the DIP Credit Agreement.

         5.5.     TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS; REAL PROPERTY; INTELLECTUAL
                  PROPERTY.

                  A.       TITLE TO PROPERTIES; LIENS. Company and its
Subsidiaries have (i) good, sufficient and legal title to (in the case of fee
interests in real property), (ii) valid leasehold interests in (in the case of
leasehold interests in real or personal property), or (iii) good title to (in
the case of all other personal property), all of their respective material
properties and assets reflected in the financial statements referred to in
subsection 5.3 or in the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to
subsection 6.1, in each case except for assets disposed of since the date of
such financial statements in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise
permitted under subsection 7.7. Except as permitted by this Agreement, all such
properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

                  B.       REAL PROPERTY. As of the Closing Date, Schedule 5.5B
annexed hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of (i) all fee
interests in any Real Property Assets and (ii) all leases, subleases or
assignments of leases (together with all amendments, modifications, supplements,
renewals or extensions of any thereof) affecting each Real Property Asset,
regardless of whether a Borrower is the landlord or tenant (whether directly or
as an assignee or successor in interest) under such lease, sublease or
assignment. As of the Closing Date, except as specified in Schedule 5.5B annexed
hereto, each agreement listed

                                      -89-
<PAGE>

in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence is in full force and effect
and no Borrower has knowledge of any material default that has occurred and is
continuing thereunder, and each such agreement constitutes the legally valid and
binding obligation of each applicable Borrower, enforceable against such
Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to
or limiting creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles.

                  C.       INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. As of the Closing Date,
Schedule 5.5C annexed hereto contains a true, accurate and complete list of all
material Intellectual Property. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries owns or has
the right to use all material Intellectual Property used in the conduct of its
business, and none of such Intellectual Property conflicts with a right of any
other Person to the extent such conflict could reasonably be expect to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.6.     LITIGATION; ADVERSE FACTS.

                  Except as set forth in Schedule 5.6 annexed hereto, there are
no Proceedings (whether or not purportedly on behalf of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) at law or in equity, or before or by any court or other Government
Authority (including any Environmental Claims) that are pending or, to the
knowledge of any Borrower, threatened against or affecting Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property of Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is in
violation of any applicable laws (including Environmental Laws) that,
individually or in the aggregate (together with all such Proceedings with
respect to substantially similar or related matters), would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) is subject to or in
default with respect to any final judgments, writs, injunctions, decrees, rules
or regulations of any court or other Government Authority that, individually or
in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.7.     PAYMENT OF TAXES.

                  Except to the extent permitted by subsection 6.3, all material
tax returns and reports of Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed by
any of them have been timely filed, and all taxes shown on such tax returns to
be due and payable (other than taxes represented by the Tax Note) and all
assessments, fees and other governmental charges upon Company and its
Subsidiaries and upon their respective properties, assets, income, businesses
and franchises that are due and payable have been paid when due and payable. No
Borrower knows of any proposed tax assessment against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, that Company or its Subsidiaries dispute or disagree with, that is
not being actively contested by Company or such Subsidiary in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings; provided, that such reserves or other appropriate
provisions, if any, as shall be required in conformity with GAAP shall have been
made or provided therefor.

         5.8.     PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS; MATERIAL CONTRACTS.

                  A.       Except as set forth on Schedule 5.8A annexed hereto,
after giving effect to the Approved Plan of Reorganization, neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any
of its Contractual Obligations, and no condition exists that, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default except
where the consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or defaults, if any,
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  B.       Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is otherwise subject to (i) any agreements or instruments the
performance of which, in the ordinary course, would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any charter or other internal
restrictions which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  C.       Schedule 5.8C contains a true, correct and complete
list of all the Material Contracts in effect on the Closing Date after giving
effect to the Approved Plan of Reorganization.

         5.9.     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

                  Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
regulation under (i) the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, (ii) the
Federal Power Act (other than as a "qualifying small power production facility",
as such term is defined in PURPA), (iii) the Interstate Commerce Act, (iv) the
Investment Company Act of 1940, or (v) any other federal or state statute or
regulation which may limit its ability to incur Indebtedness or which may
otherwise render all or any portion of the Obligations unenforceable.

         5.10.    SECURITIES ACTIVITIES.

                  A.       Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

                  B.       Following application of the proceeds of each
Revolving Loan, not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of Company
only or of Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) subject to the
provisions of subsection 7.2 or 7.7 or subject to any restriction contained in
any agreement or instrument, between Company and any Lender or any Affiliate of
any Lender, relating to Indebtedness and within the scope of subsection 8.2,
will be Margin Stock.

         5.11.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                  A.       Company, each of its Subsidiaries and, with respect
to Pension Plans and Multiemployer Plans, each of their respective ERISA
Affiliates are in material compliance with all applicable provisions and
requirements of ERISA, the regulations and

                                      -91-
<PAGE>

published interpretations thereunder and other applicable law with respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan, and have performed all of their material obligations
under each Employee Benefit Plan. Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in
material compliance with all applicable laws and orders of foreign Government
Authorities with respect to each of its pension plans and employee benefit plans
for foreign employees, and have performed all of their material obligations
under each such pension plan and employee benefit plan. Each Employee Benefit
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code has received, or has timely taken all action necessary to receive, a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to such effect
and no event has occurred (other than the enactment of legislation for which the
remedial amendment period has not expired) that would reasonably be expected to
affect adversely such Plan's qualification.

                  B.       No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected
to occur.

                  C.       Except to the extent required under Section 4980B of
the Internal Revenue Code or except as set forth in Schedule 5.11 annexed hereto
or in the financial statements delivered to Lenders pursuant to subsection 4.1
or 6.1 hereof, as applicable, no Employee Benefit Plan provides health or
welfare benefits (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for any
retired or former employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including CPIH
Subsidiaries, to the extent such CPIH Subsidiaries are ERISA Affiliates of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

                  D.       As of January 1 of each year (based on, with respect
to the Covanta Energy Pension Plan, the actuarial valuation as of such January 1
and, with respect to the SEIU Pension Plan, the actuarial valuation as of the
immediately preceding June 1), the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, but determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes with respect to a Pension Plan
(as set forth in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, including, where
applicable, the interest rate assumptions set forth in Section 412(l) of the
Internal Revenue Code)), in the aggregate for all Pension Plans (excluding for
purposes of such computation any Pension Plans with respect to which assets
exceed benefit liabilities), does not exceed (i) $20,000,000, in the event the
applicable law (including statutorily prescribed actuarial assumptions) used in
determining such unfunded benefit liabilities (the "ASSUMPTIONS") is generally
as favorable as the Assumptions used in the 2003 plan year valuations with
respect to such Pension Plans, or (ii) $26,000,000, in the event the Assumptions
are generally less favorable than the Assumptions used in the 2003 plan year
valuations with respect to such Pension Plans.

                  E.       To each Borrower's knowledge, as of the most recent
valuation date for each Multiemployer Plan for which the actuarial report (or an
estimate provided pursuant to Section 4221(e) of ERISA) is reasonably available
to Company, the potential withdrawal liability of Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective ERISA Affiliates for a complete withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan (within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA), when
aggregated with the potential liability for a complete withdrawal from all other
Multiemployer Plans for which such actuarial report (or an estimate provided
pursuant to

                                      -92-
<PAGE>

Section 4221(e) of ERISA) is reasonably available to Company, based on the
information contained in such reports, would not reasonably be expected to
exceed $7,500,000.

                  F.       Neither Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred or is
reasonably expected to incur any material liability pursuant to Title IV of
ERISA with respect to any employee benefit plan of an entity that was formerly
an ERISA Affiliate of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any
employee benefit plan that was previously maintained by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries, to the extent such CPIH Subsidiaries
are ERISA Affiliates of Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

         5.12.    CERTAIN FEES.

                  No broker's or finder's fee or commission will be payable with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each Borrower hereby indemnifies Lenders against, and agrees that it will hold
Lenders harmless from, any claim, demand or liability for any such broker's or
finder's fees alleged to have been incurred in connection herewith or therewith
and any expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of
counsel) arising in connection with any such claim, demand or liability.

         5.13.    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

                  A.       Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13 annexed hereto,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect to
periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) nor any of their
respective Facilities or operations are subject to any outstanding written
order, consent decree or settlement agreement with any Person relating to (a)
any Environmental Law, (b) any Environmental Claim, or (c) any Hazardous
Materials Activity that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or
Agent;

                  B.       Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13 annexed hereto,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect to
periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) has received any letter or
request for information under Section 104 of CERCLA or any comparable state law
regarding any condition, occurrence or activity that could reasonably be
expected to form the basis of an Environmental Claim against Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect to periods prior to the Closing
Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on
any Lender or Agent;

                  C.       Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13 annexed hereto,
there are and, to Company's knowledge, have been no conditions, occurrences, or
Hazardous Materials Activities that could reasonably be expected to form the
basis of an Environmental Claim against Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, solely with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH
Subsidiaries) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or
Agent;

                                      -93-
<PAGE>

                  D.       Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13 annexed hereto,
(i) neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect
to periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) nor, to Company's
knowledge, any predecessor of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
solely with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) has
filed any notice under any Environmental Law indicating past or present
treatment of Hazardous Materials at any Facility, (ii) none of Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' Facilities constitute facilities for the treatment, storage
or disposal of Hazardous Materials under RCRA or any state equivalent, and (iii)
none of Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' operations involves the
generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste in
violation of RCRA or any state equivalent that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
impose liability on any Lender or Agent; and

                  E.       Compliance with all current requirements pursuant to
or under Environmental Laws would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any
Lender or Agent.

         5.14.    EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  There is no strike or work stoppage in existence or threatened
involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.15.    MATTERS RELATING TO COLLATERAL.

                  A.       CREATION, PERFECTION AND PRIORITY OF LIENS. The
execution and delivery of the Collateral Documents by Credit Parties, together
with (x) the actions taken on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to
subsections 4.1M, 4.1N, 6.8, 6.9 and 6.11 and (y) the delivery to Collateral
Agent of any Pledged Collateral of the Credit Parties not delivered to
Collateral Agent at the time of execution and delivery of the applicable
Collateral Document (all of which Pledged Collateral has been so delivered) are
effective to create in favor of Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Secured
Parties, a Lien on all of the Collateral of the Credit Parties (which Lien has
priority over any other Lien on such Collateral, subject to Permitted
Encumbrances and Liens permitted under subsection 7.2A), and all filings and
other actions necessary or desirable to perfect and maintain the perfection and
such priority of such Liens have been duly made or taken and remain in full
force and effect, other than the filing of any UCC financing statements
delivered to Collateral Agent for filing (but not yet filed) and the periodic
filing of UCC continuation statements in respect of UCC financing statements
filed by or on behalf of Collateral Agent.

                  B.       GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS. No authorization,
approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Government
Authority is required for either (i) the pledge or grant by any Credit Party of
the Liens purported to be created in favor of Collateral Agent pursuant to any
of the Collateral Documents or (ii) the exercise by Collateral Agent of any
rights or remedies in respect of any Collateral (whether specifically granted or
created pursuant to any of the Collateral Documents or created or provided for
by

                                      -94-
<PAGE>

applicable law), except (a) for filings or recordings contemplated by subsection
5.15A, (b) as may be required, in connection with the disposition of any Pledged
Collateral, by laws generally affecting the offering and sale of securities, and
(c) authorizations and approvals in respect of the exercise of rights or
remedies as to any collateral of any Credit Party which is subject to regulation
under the Federal Power Act pursuant to Section 210(e)(2) of PURPA.

                  C.       ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY FILINGS. Except such as may
have been filed in favor of Collateral Agent as contemplated by subsection 5.15A
and to evidence Liens permitted pursuant to subsection 7.2, (i) no effective UCC
financing statement, fixture filing or other instrument similar in effect
covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file in any filing or recording
office, and (ii) no effective filing covering all or any part of the IP
Collateral is on file in the PTO.

                  D.       MARGIN REGULATIONS. The pledge of the Pledged
Collateral pursuant to the Collateral Documents does not violate Regulation T, U
or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                  E.       INFORMATION REGARDING COLLATERAL. All information
supplied to Collateral Agent by any Credit Party (including its officers,
employees, agents, advisors, representatives or counsel) with respect to any of
the Collateral (in each case taken as a whole with respect to any particular
Collateral) is accurate and complete in all material respects.

         5.16.    DISCLOSURE.

                  No representation or warranty of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries) contained in any Credit Document or
in any other certificate or written statement (excluding the projections, pro
forma financial statements and forward looking statements contained therein and
the estimates contained in such projections, pro forma financial statements and
forward looking statements) furnished to Lenders by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries), including any such Person's
officers, employees, agents, advisors, representatives or counsel, for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement contained as of
the date such representation or warranty was made any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading in any material respect in
light of the circumstances in which the same were made and in light of such
representations and warranties and all such prior representations and
warranties, taken as a whole. Any projections and pro forma financial
information contained in such materials are based upon good faith estimates and
assumptions believed by each Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it
being recognized by Lenders that such projections as to future events are
subject to significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, and, accordingly, no assurances are given and
no representations or warranties are made by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that any of the estimates and assumptions are correct, that the projections will
be achieved or that the forward looking statements expressed in such information
will correspond to actual results.

         5.17.    CASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

                  The summary of the Cash Management System attached hereto as
Schedule 4.1P is accurate and complete in all material respects as of the
Closing Date and does not omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements set forth therein not misleading. No Borrower has any Deposit Account
which is not described in Schedule 4.1P other than Deposit Accounts permitted to
be owned after the Closing Date pursuant to subsection 6.10. There has been no
change to the Cash Management System since the Closing Date except such changes
as are permitted under subsection 6.10 and such other changes as have been
disclosed to Lenders in writing and approved by Administrative Agent.

         5.18.    MATTERS RELATING TO CREDIT PARTIES.

                  A.       CREDIT PARTIES. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns any interest in any Subsidiary which is not a Borrower (other
than Excluded Subsidiaries).

                  B.       DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARY ASSETS. Each Subsidiary which is
a Borrower has granted a Lien in favor of Collateral Agent on substantially all
of its property (other than the Capital Stock of CPIH) pursuant to the
Collateral Documents except in any case where the grant of such Lien would
constitute a material violation of a valid and enforceable Contractual
Obligation in favor of or for the benefit of a Person other than Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates for which the required
consents have not been obtained.

                  C.       SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL STOCK. The Capital Stock of each
Subsidiary which is directly owned by any Borrower has been pledged to
Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents, except for the Capital
Stock of those Subsidiaries (other than Borrowers) (i) which is subject to a
Lien permitted under subsection 7.2A securing Indebtedness permitted under
subsection 7.1, or (ii) the pledge of which would constitute a material
violation of (a) a valid and enforceable Contractual Obligation in favor of or
for the benefit of a Person other than Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates for which the required consents have not been
obtained or (b) applicable law affecting such Borrower or such Subsidiary.

         5.19.    INVESTIGATION.

                  All obligations in existence immediately after the Closing
Date (other than obligations that do not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000,000)
to extend credit or credit support or obtain the extension of credit or credit
support or to make investments or expenditures with respect to existing or
future Projects of any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower that are
contained in Contractual Obligations or of which Borrowers are otherwise aware
have been disclosed to Administrative Agent prior to the Closing Date. Borrowers
have made such inquiry and investigation as is necessary to enable Borrowers to
make the representation contained in the preceding sentence.

         5.20.    MATTERS RELATING TO BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.

cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good
repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, all
material properties used or useful in the business of Company and its
Subsidiaries (including all Intellectual Property) and from time to time will
make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
thereof, except that Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to
perform the foregoing obligations (i) with respect to Subsidiaries or assets to
which Persons other than Company and its Subsidiaries have recourse under
Limited Recourse Debt owed to such Persons or (ii) to the extent that failure to
perform such obligations would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  B.       INSURANCE. Company will maintain or cause to be
maintained, with financially sound and reputable insurers, such public liability
insurance, third party property damage insurance, business interruption
insurance and casualty insurance with respect to liabilities, losses or damage
in respect of the assets, properties and businesses of Company and its
Subsidiaries and, for not less than one year following the Closing Date, of CPIH
Subsidiaries (provided, that Company shall not be required to maintain such
insurance with respect to CPIH Subsidiaries to the extent such insurance is not
commercially available to Company) as may customarily be carried or maintained
under similar circumstances by corporations of established reputation engaged in
similar businesses, in each case in such amounts (giving effect to
self-insurance), with such deductibles, covering such risks and otherwise on
such terms and conditions as shall be customary for corporations similarly
situated in the industry. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Company will maintain or cause to be maintained (i) flood insurance with respect
to each Flood Hazard Property that is located in a community that participates
in the National Flood Insurance Program, in each case in compliance with any
applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
and (ii) replacement value casualty insurance on the Collateral under such
policies of insurance, with such insurance companies, in such amounts, with such
deductibles, and covering such risks as are at all times satisfactory to
Administrative Agent in its commercially reasonable judgment. Unless prohibited
by contractual or other legal requirement, such policy of insurance shall (a)
name Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties as an additional
insured thereunder as its interests may appear and (b) in the case of each
business interruption and casualty insurance policy, contain a loss payable
clause or endorsement, satisfactory in form and substance to Administrative
Agent, that names Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties as the
loss payee thereunder for any covered loss in excess of $1,000,000 and provides
for at least

                                     -104-
<PAGE>


30 days prior written notice to Collateral Agent of any modification or
cancellation of such policy. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate from Borrowers'
insurance broker(s) or other evidence satisfactory to it that all insurance
required to be maintained pursuant to this subsection 6.4 is in full force and
effect and that Collateral Agent on behalf of Secured Parties has been named as
additional insured and/or loss payee thereunder to the extent required under
this subsection 6.4.

                  C.       APPLICATION OF NET INSURANCE/CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS.

                  (i)      Business Interruption Insurance. Upon receipt by
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any business interruption
         insurance proceeds constituting Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds,
         (a) so long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing, Company or such Subsidiary may retain
         and apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds for working capital
         purposes or any other purposes not prohibited under this Agreement, and
         (b) if an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing, Company shall apply an amount equal to such
         Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as provided in subsection 2.4A.

                  (ii)     Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds Received by
         Company. Upon receipt by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Net
         Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds other than from business interruption
         insurance, (a) so long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Company shall, or
         shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, promptly and diligently
         apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to pay or reimburse the
         costs of repairing, restoring or replacing the assets in respect of
         which such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received or, to the
         extent not so applied, as provided in subsection 2.4A, and (b) if an
         Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred and
         be continuing (unless Company is otherwise required to use funds by law
         or contract), Company shall apply an amount equal to such Net
         Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as provided in subsection 2.4A.

                  (iii)    Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds Received by
         Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. Upon receipt by
         Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, of any
         Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, (a) if and to the extent Company
         would have been required to apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation
         Proceeds (if it had received them directly) Administrative Agent or
         Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall, and Company hereby
         authorizes Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may
         be, to apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds as provided in
         subsection 2.4A, and (b) to the extent the foregoing clause (a) does
         not apply Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be,
         shall deliver such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to Company, and
         (1) Company and its Subsidiaries may retain and apply any portion
         thereof that is business interruption insurance proceeds for working
         capital purposes or any other purposes not prohibited under this
         Agreement and (2) Company shall, or

                                     -105-
<PAGE>

         shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, promptly apply such Net
         Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds that are not business interruption
         insurance proceeds to the costs of repairing, restoring, or replacing
         the assets in respect of which such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds
         were received; provided, however, that if at any time Administrative
         Agent reasonably determines (A) that Company or such Subsidiary is not
         proceeding diligently with such repair, restoration or replacement or
         that such repair, restoration or replacement cannot be completed within
         180 days after the receipt by Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent,
         as the case may be, of such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds,
         Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall,
         and Company hereby authorizes Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent,
         as the case may be, to apply such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds
         as provided in subsection 2.4A.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Net Insurance/Condemnation
Proceeds shall be required to be applied as provided in subsection 2.4A to the
extent such application would constitute a material violation of (1) a valid
Contractual Obligation (in effect on the Closing Date or arising under the
documentation for Limited Recourse Debt permitted to be incurred under this
Agreement) in favor of or for the benefit of a Person other than Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates for which the required
consents have not been obtained or (2) applicable law affecting Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event of any conflict or inconsistency between subsection 6.4C and the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall
prevail.

         6.5.     INSPECTION RIGHTS; LENDER MEETING.

                  A.       INSPECTION RIGHTS. Borrowers shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries to, permit any authorized representatives
designated by any Lender, at such Lender's expense, to visit and inspect any of
the properties of such Borrower or of any of its Subsidiaries, to inspect, copy
and take extracts from its and their financial and accounting records, and to
discuss its and their affairs, finances and accounts with its and their officers
and independent public accountants (provided, that Company may, if it so
chooses, be present at or participate in any such discussion), all upon
reasonable notice and at such reasonable times during normal business hours and
as often as may reasonably be requested; provided, that at any time after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrowers shall,
and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, permit such additional
visits, inspections and audits as Administrative Agent or Requisite Lenders may
deem necessary or advisable, at any time or from time to time, all at Borrowers'
expense.

                  B.       LENDER MEETING. Company will, upon the request of
Administrative Agent or Requisite Lenders, participate in a meeting of
Administrative Agent and Lenders once during each Fiscal Year to be held at
Company's corporate offices (or at such other location as may be agreed to by
Company and Administrative Agent) at such time as may be agreed to by Company
and Administrative Agent.

         6.6.     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC.

                  Borrowers shall comply, and shall cause each of their
Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries) to comply, with the requirements of
all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Government Authority
(including all Environmental Laws), noncompliance with which could reasonably be
expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         audits, investigations, analyses and reports of any kind or character
         (excluding writings which are protected by attorney-client privilege or
         the work-product doctrine or confidential self-evaluative writings),
         whether prepared by personnel of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
         by independent consultants, governmental authorities or any other
         Persons, with respect to significant environmental matters at any
         Facility that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on
         any Lender or Administrative Agent or with respect to any Environmental
         Claims that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on
         any Lender or Administrative Agent;

                  (ii)     Notice of Certain Releases, Remedial Actions, Etc.
         Promptly upon the occurrence thereof, written notice describing in
         reasonable detail (a) any Release required to be reported to any
         federal, state or local governmental or regulatory agency under any
         applicable Environmental Laws that could reasonably be expected to have
         a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or
         Administrative Agent, (b) any remedial action taken by Company or any
         other Person in response to (1) any Hazardous Materials Activities the

         Material Adverse Effect or imposing liability on any Lender or
         Administrative Agent, or (2) any Environmental Claims that,
         individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender
         or Administrative Agent;

                  (iii)    Written Communications Regarding Environmental
         Claims, Releases, Etc. As soon as practicable following the sending or

         confidential self-evaluative writings), with respect to (a) the
         commencement or the threat to commence a proceeding regarding any
         Environmental Claims that, individually or in the aggregate, could
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material

                                     -107-
<PAGE>

         Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or Agent, (b) any
         Release required to be reported to any federal, state or local
         governmental or regulatory agency that could reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or
         Administrative Agent, and (c) any request for information from any
         governmental agency that suggests such agency is investigating whether
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be potentially responsible for
         any Hazardous Materials Activity that could reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect or impose liability on any Lender or
         Administrative Agent;

                  (iv)     Notice of Certain Proposed Actions Having
         Environmental Impact. Prompt written notice describing in reasonable
         detail (a) any proposed acquisition of stock, assets, or property by
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to
         (1) expose Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or result in,
         Environmental Claims that could reasonably be expected to have,
         individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or impose
         liability on any Lender or Administrative Agent or (2) affect the
         ability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to maintain in full force
         and effect all Governmental Authorizations required under any
         Environmental Laws for their respective operations except to the extent
         the failure to maintain such Governmental Authorizations could not
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or impose
         liability on any Lender or Administrative Agent and (b) any proposed
         action to be taken by Company or any of its Subsidiaries to commence
         manufacturing or other industrial operations or to modify current
         operations in a manner that could reasonably be expected to subject
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any additional obligations or
         requirements under any Environmental Laws that could reasonably be
         expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Effect or impose liability on any Lender or Administrative Agent; and

                  (v)      Certain Communications. With respect to documents
         which would have been required to be provided to Administrative Agent
         pursuant to paragraph (i) or (iii) but for the parenthetical in those
         paragraphs, Company shall promptly upon receiving such documents
         provide a list identifying generally the documents not disclosed and
         summarizing the information contained in such documents to the extent
         consistent with not waiving any privilege with respect thereto. If the
         privilege prevents Company from summarizing the information contained
         in such documents Company (a) shall nevertheless advise Administrative
         Agent that a matter, the nature of which cannot be disclosed without
         waiving the applicable privilege, exists with respect to a specified
         Facility or Environmental Claim that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
         (b) shall provide such other information to Administrative Agent,
         consistent with not waving the privilege, that Administrative Agent may
         reasonably request.

                  B.       COMPANY'S ACTIONS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND
VIOLATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Company shall promptly take, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries promptly to take, any and all actions necessary to (i)
cure any violation of applicable Environmental Laws by Company or its
Subsidiaries (including, solely with

                                     -108-
<PAGE>

respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) that could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect and (ii) make an appropriate response to any Environmental Claim
against Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, solely with respect to
periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries) and discharge any
obligations it may have to any Person thereunder where failure to do so could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect (except if Company and its Subsidiaries do not have standing to
contest or respond to such Environmental Claim); provided, however, that Company
may, without breaching the requirements of this subsection 6.7B, contest an
alleged violation of Environmental Laws or an Environmental Claim in good faith
by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted so long
as during such contest the failure to cure such violation or to respond to such
Environmental Claim or discharge the obligations thereunder could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.8.     EXECUTION OF BORROWER JOINDER AGREEMENT AND PERSONAL PROPERTY
                  COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

                  A.       EXECUTION OF BORROWER JOINDER AGREEMENT AND PERSONAL
PROPERTY COLLATERAL DOCUMENTS. In the event that any Subsidiary of Company
existing on the Closing Date ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary, Company will
promptly notify Administrative Agent of that fact and cause such Subsidiary
promptly (and in any event no later than 30 days after it ceases to be an
Excluded Subsidiary) to execute and deliver to Administrative Agent a Borrower
Joinder Agreement and counterparts of the Security Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement and to take all such further actions and execute all
such further documents and instruments (including actions, documents and
instruments comparable to those described in subsection 4.1M) as may be
necessary or, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, desirable to create in
favor of Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Secured Parties, a valid and
perfected First Priority security interest in all of the personal and mixed
property assets of such Subsidiary described in the applicable forms of
Collateral Documents, subject to any Liens in existence on the date such
Subsidiary ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary to the extent permitted under
subsection 7.2A, provided, that at the request of Company in connection with
sales of assets permitted under subsection 7.7, Administrative Agent shall,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, direct Collateral Agent
(without need for any further consent from any Lender or Lenders) to release any
Liens on a Subsidiary's assets and/or release a Subsidiary from this Agreement
solely to the extent required by the terms of any such sales permitted under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no Capital Stock of any Subsidiary that
meets the criteria set forth in subsections 5.18C(i) or 5.18C(ii) shall be
required to be pledged as Collateral pursuant to this subsection.

                  B.       SUBSIDIARY ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS, LEGAL OPINIONS,
ETC. Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent, together with the relevant
Credit Documents, (i) certified copies of Organizational Documents of each
Subsidiary which is becoming a Borrower pursuant to subsection 6.8A (each, an
"ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARY BORROWER"), together with a good standing certificate
from the Secretary of State of the jurisdiction of such Subsidiary's
organization and each other state in which such Person is

                                     -109-
<PAGE>

qualified to do business and, to the extent generally available, a certificate
or other evidence of good standing as to payment of any applicable franchise or
similar taxes from the appropriate taxing authority of each of such
jurisdictions, each to be dated a recent date prior to their delivery to
Administrative Agent, (ii) a certificate executed by the secretary or similar
officer of such Subsidiary as to (a) the fact that the attached resolutions of
the Governing Body of such Subsidiary approving and authorizing the execution,
delivery and performance of such Credit Documents are in full force and effect
and have not been modified or amended and (b) the incumbency and signatures of
the officers of such Subsidiary executing such Credit Documents, and (iii) a
favorable opinion of counsel to such Subsidiary, in form and substance
satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel, as to (a) the due
organization and good standing of such Subsidiary, (b) the due authorization,
execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of such Credit Documents, (c) the
enforceability of such Credit Documents against such Subsidiary and (d) such
other matters (including matters relating to the creation and perfection of
Liens in any Collateral pursuant to such Credit Documents) as Administrative
Agent may reasonably request, all of the foregoing to be satisfactory in form
and substance to Administrative Agent and its counsel.

                  C.       RELEASE OF RESTRICTIONS. Borrowers shall use their
good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents
from all Persons in whose favor or for whose benefit Contractual Obligations are
in effect which would be violated by (i) a pledge of the Capital Stock of any
Subsidiary of a Borrower, (ii) entry into a Borrower Joinder Agreement by a
Subsidiary which is not already a Borrower, or (iii) granting a Lien on
substantially all of the assets of a Subsidiary. The foregoing efforts shall be
exercised so as to obtain such consents as soon as practicable but no later than
90 days after the Closing Date.

         6.9.     MATTERS RELATING TO ADDITIONAL REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL.

                  From and after the Closing Date, in the event that any
Borrower acquires any fee interest in real property or any Material Leasehold
Property, such Borrower shall, as soon as practicable after such Person acquires
such real property or Material Leasehold Property, execute, acknowledge, file,
record, do and deliver all and any further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages,
hypothecations, pledges, charges, assignments, financing statements and
continuations thereof, notices of assignment, transfers, certificates,
assurances and other instruments, opinions, appraisals, title insurance and
environmental reports as Administrative Agent may reasonably request to perfect
and maintain the Liens created by the Collateral Documents, including, without
limitation, deliver to Collateral Agent in proper form for recording in all
appropriate places in all applicable jurisdictions, encumbering the interest of
such Borrower in such mortgaged property; and such opinions, appraisal,
documents, title insurance, environmental reports that would have been delivered
on the Closing Date if such mortgaged were a Closing Date Mortgaged Property,
and to assure, convey, assign, transfer and confirm unto Collateral Agent, for
the benefit of the Secured Parties, the property and rights thereby conveyed and
assigned or intended to now or hereafter be conveyed or assigned or that any
Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or to assign to
Administrative Agent.

to time pursuant to clause (i)(c) below, and Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not open or close Deposit Accounts or make other changes to the Cash Management

with Collateral Agent or other depository institutions after the Closing Date so
long as (a) concurrently with the opening of any such account with a depository

effect to such opening Borrowers would not be in breach of the requirement set
forth in clause (i)(b)), (b) the aggregate amount on deposit at any time in all
Deposit Accounts maintained with depository institutions other than Collateral
Agent for which Control Agreements have not been delivered to Collateral Agent
shall not exceed $1,000,000, and (c) concurrently with the opening of any such
account, Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent a written notice
setting forth the account number and the name of the relevant depository
institution (it being understood that such written notice shall be deemed to
supplement Schedule 4.1P annexed hereto for all purposes of this Agreement) and,
if applicable, the Project to which such account relates and the primary purpose
of such account, and (ii) after the Closing Date Company and its Subsidiaries
may open and maintain funds in Restricted Accounts that are required to be
opened by Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a Contractual
Obligation binding on such Person so long as promptly upon opening any such
account, a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail (a) the Project or
obligation to which such account relates, (b) a description of the Contractual
Obligation requiring such account to be opened, and (c) the provisions of this
Agreement permitting such account to be opened and maintained (it being

         6.11.    FURTHER ASSURANCES.

                  A.       ASSURANCES. Without expense or cost to Administrative

agreements, hypothecations, pledges, charges, assignments, financing statements
and continuations thereof, notices of assignment, transfers, certificates,
assurances and other instruments as Administrative Agent may from time to time
reasonably request and that do not involve a material expansion of Borrowers'
obligations or liabilities hereunder in order to carry out more effectively the
purposes of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and the Confirmation
Order, including to subject any Collateral, intended to now or hereafter be
covered, to the Liens created by the Collateral Documents and the Confirmation
Order, to perfect and maintain such Liens, and to assure, convey, assign,
transfer and confirm unto Collateral Agent the property and rights thereby
conveyed and assigned or intended to now or hereafter be conveyed or assigned or

jointly and severally pay all filing, registration and recording fees and all
expenses incident to the execution and acknowledgement of any Mortgage or other
Credit Document, including any instrument of further assurance described in
subsection 6.11A, and shall pay all mortgage recording taxes, transfer taxes,

Credit Document, including any instrument of further assurance described in
subsection 6.11A, or by reason of its interest in, or measured by amounts
payable under, the Notes, the Mortgages or any other Credit Document, including
any instrument of further assurance described in subsection 6.11A, (excluding
income, franchise and doing business Taxes), and shall pay all stamp Taxes and
other Taxes required to be paid on any Credit Document; provided, however, that
such Borrower may contest in good faith and through appropriate proceedings, any
such Taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges; provided further, however,
that such Borrower shall pay all such Taxes, duties, imposts and charges when
due to the appropriate taxing authority during the pendency of any such
proceedings if required to do so to stay enforcement thereof. If any Borrower
fails to make any of the payments described in the preceding sentence within 10
days after notice thereof from Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as
is necessary to protect the loss of or diminution in value of any Collateral by
reason of tax foreclosure or otherwise, as determined by Administrative Agent)
accompanied by documentation verifying the nature and amount of such payments,
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) pay the amount due and
Borrowers shall jointly and severally reimburse all amounts in accordance with
the terms hereof.

                  C.       COSTS OF DEFENDING AND UPHOLDING THE LIEN.
Administrative Agent may, upon at least 5 days' prior notice to Borrowers, (i)
appear in and defend any action or proceeding, in the name and on behalf of
Administrative Agent, Lenders or any Borrower, in which Administrative Agent or
any Lender is named or which Administrative Agent in its sole discretion
determines is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect any Mortgaged
Property, any other Collateral, any Mortgage, the Lien thereof or any other
Credit Document and (ii) institute any action or proceeding which Administrative
Agent reasonably determines should be instituted to protect the interest or
rights of Administrative Agent and Lenders in any Mortgaged Property or other
Collateral or under this Agreement or any other Credit Document. Borrowers,
jointly and severally, agree that all reasonable costs and expenses expended or
otherwise incurred pursuant to this subsection (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and disbursements) by Administrative Agent shall be paid pursuant to
subsection 10.2 hereof.

                  Company shall obtain no later than three months after the
Closing Date, ratings of the High Yield Notes from S&P and/or Moody's; provided,
however, that if such ratings shall not have been obtained by such date solely
due to inaction or a refusal to act by any such rating agency that is, in either
case, beyond the control of Borrowers (as determined in the reasonable judgment
of Administrative Agent), Borrowers shall not be in breach of this subsection
6.12 so long as Borrowers shall take all steps Administrative Agent reasonably
requests from time to time to obtain such ratings.

         6.13.    MOST FAVORED NATIONS PAYMENTS.

                  Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
extend any fees or pricing increases, to the extent such fees or pricing
increases are the direct obligation of Company or its Subsidiaries, resulting
from the amendment, waiver or modification, after the Closing Date, of the
Detroit L/C Facility Documents, on an equivalent basis (based in the case of
fees on the respective amounts of Letter of Credit Exposure outstanding (on one
hand) and the credit exposure under the Detroit L/C Facility Documents (on the
other hand)) to the Lenders regardless of whether a particular Lender has
participated in or consented to a corresponding amendment, waiver or
modification (if any) of the Credit Documents, and any such payment of
equivalent fees shall be paid in cash concurrently with the fees giving rise to
such equivalent fees.

         6.14.    MONTGOMERY CLOSING DATE LETTER OF CREDIT CANCELLATION.

                  No later than 20 Business Days after Company receives a rating
with respect to its senior debt and subordinated debt of at least "BBB" from S&P
and at least "Baa" from Moody's, Company shall cause the Montgomery Closing Date
Letter of Credit to be returned undrawn to Company for cancellation; provided,
however, that if Company is unable to obtain the return of the Montgomery
Closing Date Letter of Credit by such date as a result of inaction or refusal by
the beneficiary of the Montgomery Closing Date Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall
not be in breach of this subsection 6.14 so long as Borrowers shall prior
thereto or promptly thereafter initiate appropriate Proceedings with appropriate
Government Authorities to obtain the return of the Montgomery Closing Date
Letter of Credit.

Obligations and the cancellation or expiration of all Letters of Credit, unless
Requisite Lenders shall otherwise give prior written consent, Borrowers shall
perform, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to perform, all covenants in
this Section 7.

ratable Lien; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, this covenant shall

annexed hereto; and (ii) for purposes of determining compliance with subsection
7.6A for any four-Fiscal Quarter period ending prior to the last Fiscal Quarter
of 2004, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense shall equal the product of (a)
actual Consolidated Cash Interest Expense during the period from the Closing
Date to the end of such four-Fiscal Quarter period multiplied by (b) the ratio
of (1) 365 divided by (2) the number of days in such period; and (iii) for
purposes of determining compliance with each of the covenants in this subsection
7.6, each of Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense, Consolidated
Net Worth, Non-Borrower Cash Flow and Consolidated Facilities Capital
Expenditures shall not include any portion thereof attributable to the results
of operations or financial position, as the case may be, of CPIH Subsidiaries
for the relevant period or as of the relevant date of determination.

         Borrower, or be liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or all or any part
         of its business, property or assets may be conveyed, sold, leased,
         transferred or otherwise disposed of, in one transaction or a series of

         shall result in the obligee or beneficiary of any Indebtedness or
         Contingent Obligation (other than the Obligations) of such Immaterial
         Foreign Subsidiary having greater recourse to assets or Persons for the
         payment or collection of such Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation
         than such obligee or beneficiary had immediately prior to such
         transaction and (2) the relevant Borrower shall be a surviving entity
         in any such transaction;

                  (iii)    Company and its Subsidiaries may sell or otherwise

                  (iv)     Company and its Subsidiaries may make Asset Sales,
         provided, that (a) the consideration received for such assets shall be
         in an amount at least equal to the fair market value thereof; (b) not
         less than 90% of the consideration received (other than any
         consideration consisting of the assumption of liabilities related to
         such assets) in any such Asset Sale shall be cash (it being agreed that
         cash the receipt of which may by the relevant terms of such Asset Sale
         be deferred more than six months after the date of consummation of such
         Asset Sale shall not be considered cash for purposes of this clause
         (b)); (c) not more than 10% of the cash consideration received by

         Proceeds from any Asset Sale, when added to the aggregate Net Asset
         Sale Proceeds from all other Asset Sales after the Closing Date, would
         exceed $10,000,000, Company and its Subsidiaries

the rendering of any service) with any holder of 5% or more of any class of
equity Securities of Company or with any Affiliate of Company or of any such
holder, on terms that are less favorable to Company or that Subsidiary, as the
case may be, than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are
not such a holder or Affiliate; provided, that the foregoing restriction shall
not apply to (i) any Indebtedness permitted under subsection 7.1 among Company
and its Subsidiaries or among Subsidiaries of Company, (ii) reasonable and

such indemnifications or arrangements are entered into, provided, that such

than those that would have been obtained at the relevant time from Persons who
are not such a holder or Affiliate, (iv) any employment agreements or benefits
arrangements entered into on or after the Closing Date by Company and its
Subsidiaries with employees at arms' length and on terms that are no less

Subsidiaries to, become liable in any way, whether directly by assignment or as
a guarantor or other surety, for the obligations of the lessee under any lease
for equipment (other than intercompany leases between Borrowers), unless,
immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of liability with respect to

consecutive calendar months shall not exceed $3,000,000; provided, however, that
this subsection 7.9 shall not prohibit Company or its Subsidiaries from
incurring obligations pursuant to the renewal, extension or replacement of
leases in effect at the Closing Date so long as such leases as renewed, extended
or replaced are not more disadvantageous in any material respect to Company and
its Subsidiaries and the Lenders than the leases so renewed, extended or
replaced.

         7.10.    [Intentionally Omitted]

         7.11.    CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

                  From and after the Closing Date, Company shall not, and shall

reasonably related to such businesses.

         7.12.    AMENDMENTS TO RELATED AGREEMENTS, DEBT DOCUMENTATION AND
                  ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS.

with an amendment, restatement, modification or waiver of) any material
provision of (i) the Management Services and Reimbursement Agreement or the
other Related Agreements (other than the Detroit L/C Facility Documents), in
each case if the effect of such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver,
together with all other amendments, restatements, modifications or waivers made,
(a) except as otherwise permitted under subsection 7.1(xiii), is to impose
additional material obligations on, or confer material additional rights to the
holders thereof (or to other obligees with respect thereto) against, Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (b) is otherwise adverse to the interests of the
Lenders in a manner deemed material in the judgment of Administrative Agent;
(ii) the Organizational Documents of Company and its Subsidiaries, if the effect
of such amendment, restatement, modification or waiver, together with all other
amendments, restatements, modifications or waivers made, is adverse to the
interests of the Lenders in a manner deemed material in the judgment of
Administrative Agent; (iii) the Subordinated Indebtedness, if the effect thereof
would be to (a) change to earlier dates the dates on which any payments of
principal or interest are due thereon, (b) increase the interest rate, or the
portion thereof payable on a current basis in cash, applicable thereto, (c)
change any event of default with respect thereto in any manner adverse to the
interests of the Lenders, (d) change the redemption, prepayment or defeasance
provisions thereof, (e) change the subordination provisions thereof (or of any
guaranty thereof or intercreditor arrangement with respect thereto), (f) change
any collateral therefor (other than to release such collateral), or (g) change
any other term or provision thereof, if the effect of such change, together with
all other changes made, is to increase materially the obligations of the obligor
thereunder or to confer any additional rights on the holders of such
Indebtedness that would be materially adverse (in the judgment of Administrative
Agent or Requisite Lenders so notifying Administrative Agent or Company) to
Company, Administrative Agent or the Lenders, without the prior written consent
of Requisite Lenders; (iv) the principal documents relating

                                     -133-
<PAGE>

to Limited Recourse Debt with respect to a Project if such amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver, together with all other amendments,
restatements, modifications and waivers made, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; or (v) the Detroit L/C Facility Documents,
unless (a) the terms of the Detroit L/C Facility Documents as so amended,
restated, modified or waived are not more disadvantageous to Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Lenders (in a manner deemed material by Administrative
Agent) than the Detroit L/C Facility Documents in effect on the Closing Date (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment, restatement, modification or
waiver having the effect of reducing, delaying or waiving any otherwise required
reduction in the amount of any commitment to extend letters of credit under the
Detroit L/C Facility Documents shall be deemed to be more disadvantageous for
purposes of this clause (a) without further notice or other action by
Administrative Agent), (b) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness and letters of
credit outstanding and additional Commitments to extend credit, if any, under
the Detroit L/C Facility Documents as so amended, restated, modified or waived,
do not exceed the aggregate amount of the commitments to extend credit in effect
under the Detroit L/C Facility Documents on the Closing Date (or, if less, the
amount of such commitments in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver), plus $5,000,000, (c) the credit available
under the Detroit L/C Facility Documents as so amended, restated, modified or
waived is limited to letters of credit issuable in connection with the Project
to which the Existing Detroit L/Cs relate (provided, that the requirements of
this clause (c) shall not apply with respect to credit extended pursuant to the
$5,000,000 additional amount described at the end of the foregoing clause (b)),
(d) the obligations under (and the Liens securing) the Detroit L/C Facility
Documents as so amended, restated, modified or waived are subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement on terms substantively identical to the terms applicable
to the obligations in effect under the Detroit L/C Facility Documents in effect
on the Closing Date, and (e) Company provides to Administrative Agent reasonable
prior advance written notice of such proposed amendment, restatement,
modification or waiver and copies of all material contracts or other agreements
being entered into in connection therewith).

         7.13.    END OF FISCAL YEARS; FISCAL QUARTERS.

         7.14.    AMENDMENT TO PENSION PLANS.

Closing Date in any manner that results in or would reasonably be expected to
result in an increase in the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (as such
unfunded benefit liabilities are determined in accordance with subsection 5.11D
hereof), unless such amendment or modification is required under applicable law.

SECTION 9. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

         9.1.     APPOINTMENT.

                  A.       APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Bank One is
hereby appointed Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents. Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its
agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents. Administrative Agent agrees to act upon the express conditions
contained in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, as applicable. The
provisions of this Section 9 are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent
and Lenders and no Credit Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary
of any of the provisions thereof. In performing its functions and duties under
this Agreement, Administrative Agent (other than as provided in subsection 2.1E)
shall act solely as an agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be
deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust
with or for any Borrower or any other Credit Party.

                  B.       CONTROL. Each Lender and Administrative Agent hereby
appoint each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Collateral
Agent's security interest in assets that, in accordance with the UCC, can be
perfected by possession or control.

         9.2.     POWERS AND DUTIES; GENERAL IMMUNITY.

                  A.       POWERS; DUTIES SPECIFIED. Each Lender irrevocably
authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and
to exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the other
Credit Documents as are specifically delegated or granted to Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers, rights and
remedies as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall have
only those duties and responsibilities that are expressly specified in this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Administrative Agent may exercise such
powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through its
Affiliates, agents or employees. Administrative Agent shall not have, by reason
of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, a fiduciary relationship
in respect of any Lender or any Borrower; and nothing in this Agreement or any
of the other Credit Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be
so construed as to impose upon Administrative Agent any obligations in respect
of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents except as expressly set
forth herein or therein.

                  B.       NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN MATTERS. Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document or for any representations, warranties,
recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral
statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or
certificates or any other documents furnished or made by Administrative Agent to
Lenders

                                     -140-
<PAGE>

or by or on behalf of any Borrower to Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection with the Credit Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby
or for the financial condition or business affairs of Borrowers or any other
Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall Administrative Agent
be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any
of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any
of the Credit Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Revolving Loans
or the use of the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible existence
of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default. Anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall not
have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of the Letter of
Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof.

                  C.       EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to
Lenders for any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the Credit Documents except to the extent caused by
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any action
(including the failure to take an action) in connection with this Agreement or
any of the other Credit Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion
or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until
Administrative Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from
Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such
instructions under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such instructions from
Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or
to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such
instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i)
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or
persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on
opinions and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Company and its
Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by
it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against
Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agent acting or (where so
instructed) refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other
Credit Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or
such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection
10.6).

                  D.       ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT ENTITLED TO ACT AS LENDER. The
agency hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and
powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity as a Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in
the Revolving Loans and the Letters of Credit, Administrative Agent shall have
the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not performing the duties and functions delegated to it
hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any similar term shall, unless
the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Administrative Agent in its
individual

                                     -141-
<PAGE>

capacity. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
commercial banking, investment banking, trust, financial advisory or other
business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing the
duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any
Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without
having to account for the same to Lenders.

         9.3.     INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION BY LENDERS; NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
                  APPRAISAL OF CREDITWORTHINESS.

                  Each Lender agrees that it has made its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Revolving Loans and the
issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue
to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Company and its
Subsidiaries. Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any
such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession
before the making of any Revolving Loan or the issuance of any Letter of Credit
or at any time or times thereafter, and Administrative Agent shall not have any
responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any
information provided to Lenders.

         9.4.     RIGHT TO INDEMNITY.

                  Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally
agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys, professional advisors and affiliates to the extent that any
such Person shall not have been reimbursed by Borrowers, for and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements and fees and
disbursements of any financial advisor engaged by Administrative Agent) or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against Administrative Agent or other such Persons in exercising
the powers, rights and remedies of Administrative Agent or performing duties of
Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Credit Documents or otherwise
in its capacity as Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the other Credit Documents; provided, that no Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
Administrative Agent resulting from Administrative Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to Administrative Agent or any
other such Person for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Administrative Agent,
be insufficient or become impaired, Administrative Agent may call for additional
indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until
such additional indemnity is furnished.

         9.5.     SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS.

                  Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days'
prior written notice thereof to Lenders and Borrowers, and Administrative Agent
may be removed at any time with or without cause by an instrument or concurrent
instruments in writing delivered to Borrowers and Administrative Agent and
signed by Requisite Lenders. If Bank One is an Issuing Lender, any such
resignation or removal of Bank One as Administrative Agent shall also constitute
its resignation or removal as Issuing Lender. Upon any such notice of
resignation or any such removal, Requisite Lenders shall have the right, upon 5
Business Days' notice to Borrowers, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent.
If, within 30 days after the date of Administrative Agent's notice of its
intention to resign, no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by Requisite Lenders, then the Administrative Agent's resignation
shall become effective on such date without the need for any further action and
the Lenders shall be deemed to have been appointed as successor to
Administrative Agent hereunder and shall thereafter perform all of the duties of
Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any other Credit Document until the
appointment by Requisite Lenders of such other successor Administrative Agent.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor Administrative Agent, including the Lenders as successor to
Administrative Agent (who shall be deemed to have accepted such appointment
pursuant to this subsection 9.5), such successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (and, if
the removed Agent is an Issuing Lender, all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of an Issuing Lender), the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement, and, if the
retiring or removed Agent is an Issuing Lender, such retiring or removed Issuing
Lender shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement,
without any other or further act or deed on the part of such retiring or removed
Issuing Lender or any other Lender; provided, however, that the successor
Issuing Lender shall be obligated to issue Letters of Credit in substitution for
the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or to
make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring or removed Issuing Lender
to effectively assume the obligations of such retiring or removed Issuing Lender
with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit, and such retiring or removed
Issuing Lender shall continue to have all rights of an Issuing Lender with
respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit until the cancellation or
expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
thereunder. After any retiring or removed Administrative Agent's resignation or
removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents.

         9.6.     INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.

                  Each Lender hereby further authorizes Administrative Agent, on
behalf of and for the benefit of Lenders, to enter into and to be the agent for
and representative of Lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement, and each Lender
agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, that
Administrative Agent shall not (i) enter into or

                                     -143-
<PAGE>

consent to any material amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
provision contained in the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) release any
Collateral (except as otherwise expressly permitted or required pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or the applicable Collateral Document), in each case
without the prior consent of Requisite Lenders (or, if required pursuant to
subsection 10.6, all Lenders). Anything contained in any of the Credit Documents
to the contrary notwithstanding, each Borrower, Administrative Agent and each
Lender hereby agree that (1) no Lender shall have any right individually to
realize upon any of the Collateral under any Collateral Document, it being
understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral
Documents may be exercised solely by Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured
Parties in accordance with the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement,
and (2) in the event of a foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the
Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, Administrative Agent or any
Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale
and Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of Lenders (but not
any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless
Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the
purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for
all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and
apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for
any Collateral payable by Administrative Agent at such sale.

         9.7.     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

                  In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial proceeding relative to Company or any of the Subsidiaries of
Company, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether any Obligation shall then
be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise

                  (i)      to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
         principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of any Obligations
         that are owing and unpaid and to file such other papers or documents as
         may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders
         and Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
         compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Lenders and
         Administrative Agent and their agents and counsel and all other amounts
         due Lenders and Administrative Agent under subsections 2.2, 3.2 and
         10.2) allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

                  (ii)     to collect and receive any moneys or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that
Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
Lenders, to pay to Administrative Agent any amount

                                     -144-
<PAGE>

due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
Administrative Agent and their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due
Administrative Agent under subsections 2.3, 3.2 and 10.2.

                  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1.    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS IN
                  LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  A.       GENERAL. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of Lenders (it
being understood that Lenders' rights of assignment are subject to the further
provisions of this subsection 10.1). Neither any Borrower's rights or
obligations hereunder nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by
any Borrower without the prior written consent of all Lenders (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void). No sale, assignment or transfer or participation of any Letter of Credit
or any participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment,
transfer or participation of a corresponding interest in the relevant Letter of
Credit Commitment of the Lender effecting such sale, assignment, transfer or
participation. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Affiliates of each of Administrative Agent and Lenders)
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement. No Lender shall be permitted to assign any portion of its rights or
obligations hereunder to any other Person if, upon giving effect to such
assignment, Borrowers would be obligated to pay such assignee amounts greater
than the amounts, if any, which Borrowers would have been required to pay such
assigning Lender under subsection 2.4 if such assignment did not occur.

                  B.       ASSIGNMENTS.

                  (i)      Amounts and Terms of Assignments. Any Lender may
         assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its
         rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided, that (a) except
         (1) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
         assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement or (2)
         in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or
         an Approved Fund of a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Credit
         Exposure of the assigning Lender and the assignee subject to each such
         assignment shall not be less than $5,000,000, determined as of the date
         the Assignment Agreement with respect to such assignment is delivered
         to Administrative Agent or, if a trade date is specified in

                                     -145-
<PAGE>

         the Assignment Agreement, as of such trade date, unless Administrative
         Agent otherwise consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
         or delayed, (b) such assignment shall consist of corresponding amounts
         of the Letter of Credit Commitment of such Lender and the portion of
         such Letter of Credit Commitment that is available for the making of
         Revolving Loans (for example, if such assignment includes 20% of the
         Letter of Credit Commitment of such Lender it shall also include 20% of
         the portion of such Letter of Credit Commitment that is available for
         the making of Revolving Loans), (c) the parties to each assignment
         shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment
         Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of $5,000,
         and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender prior to such
         assignment, shall deliver to Administrative Agent a counterpart to the
         Intercreditor Agreement and such documents and information reasonably
         requested by Administrative Agent, including such forms, certificates
         or other evidence, if any, with respect to United States federal income
         tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement
         may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to
         subsection 2.7B(iii), and no such assignment shall be effective unless
         and until such Assignment Agreement is accepted by Administrative Agent
         and recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii), (d)
         except in the case of an assignment to another Lender, Administrative
         Agent and Issuing Lender shall have consented thereto (which consents
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood that
         nothing in this clause (c) shall affect the requirement that the
         relevant assignee meet the requirements in the definition of Eligible
         Assignee and any other applicable requirements of this Agreement)), (e)
         no assignment by a Defaulting Lender shall be permitted unless such
         Defaulting Lender or assignee has funded such Defaulting Lender's
         defaulted funding obligations with respect to Revolving Loans and
         participations in Letters of Credit and (f) unless an Event of Default
         or Potential Event of Default then exists, Borrowers shall have
         consented to any such assignment (such consent not to be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed). Upon such execution, delivery and consent, from
         and after the effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement,
         (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
         that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
         to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of
         a Lender hereunder, (y) the assignee shall be a party to the
         Intercreditor Agreement and, to the extent that rights and obligations
         have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall
         have the rights and obligations of a "Creditor Party" thereunder (as
         such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and (z) the
         assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and
         obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
         Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights
         which survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.9B)
         and be released from its obligations under this Agreement and the
         Intercreditor Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement
         covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
         party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
         subsection 10.9; provided, that anything contained in any of the Credit
         Documents to

                                     -146-
<PAGE>

         the contrary notwithstanding (but subject to subsection 9.5), if such
         Lender is the Issuing Lender such Lender shall continue to have all
         rights and obligations of Issuing Lender with respect to any Letters of
         Credit issued by it until the cancellation or expiration of such
         Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn
         thereunder). The assigning Lender of any Revolving Loan Commitments
         and/or Revolving Loans shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment
         or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its Revolving
         Notes, if any, to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon
         new Revolving Notes shall, if so requested by the assignee and/or the
         assigning Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1F, be issued to the
         assignee and/or to the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of
         Exhibit II annexed hereto, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the
         new Revolving Loan Commitments and/or outstanding Revolving Loans, as
         the case may be, of the assignee and/or the assigning Lender. Other
         than as provided in subsection 10.5, any assignment or transfer by a
         Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
         comply with this subsection 10.1B shall be treated for purposes of this
         Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
         and obligations in accordance with subsection 10.1C. Except as
         otherwise provided in this subsection 10.1, no Lender shall, as between
         Borrowers and such Lender, as between Agents and such Lender, or as
         between Issuing Lender and such Lender, be relieved of any of its
         obligations hereunder as a result of any sale, assignment or transfer
         of, or any granting of participations in, all or any part of its Letter
         of Credit Commitment, Letters of Credit or participations therein or
         the other Obligations owed to such Lender.

                  (ii)     Acceptance by Administrative Agent; Recordation in
         Register. Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an
         assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
         Assignee and the processing and recordation fee referred to in
         subsection 10.1B(i) and any forms, certificates or other evidence with
         respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters that
         such assignee may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent
         pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii), Administrative Agent shall, if
         Administrative Agent and Issuing Lenders have consented to the
         assignment evidenced thereby (to the extent each such consent is
         required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment
         Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which
         acceptance shall evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent
         to such assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in
         the Register, and (c) give prompt notice thereof to Company.
         Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement
         delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this subsection
         10.1B(ii).

                  C.       PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may, without the consent
of, or notice to, any Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to
one or more Persons (other than a natural Person or any Borrower or any of its
Affiliates) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under
this Agreement; provided, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely

                                     -147-
<PAGE>

responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided, that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
directly affecting (i) the extension of the Maturity Date or (ii) a reduction of
the principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on any Obligation
allocated to such participation. Subject to the further provisions of this
subsection 10.1C, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of subsections 2.6D and 2.7 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection 10.1B.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of subsection 10.4 as though it were a Lender, provided, such
Participant agrees to be subject to subsection 10.5 as though it were a Lender.
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
subsections 2.6D and 2.7 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with Borrowers' prior
written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-US Lender if it were a Lender
shall not be entitled to the benefits of subsection 2.7.

                  D.       PLEDGES AND ASSIGNMENTS. Any Lender may at any time
pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of the Obligations
owed to such Lender, to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge
or assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank; provided, that
(i) no Lender shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result
of any such assignment or pledge and (ii) in no event shall any assignee or
pledgee be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder.

                  E.       INFORMATION. Each Lender may furnish any information
concerning Company and its Subsidiaries (including CPIH Subsidiaries) in the
possession of that Lender from time to time to assignees and participants
(including prospective assignees and participants), subject to subsection 10.20.

                  F.       AGREEMENTS OF LENDERS. Each Lender listed on the
signature pages hereof hereby agrees, and each Lender that becomes a party
hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree, (i) that it
is an Eligible Assignee described in clause (i) of the definition thereof; (ii)
that it has experience and expertise in the making or purchasing of loans such
as the Revolving Loans and in the funding of or purchasing participations of the
type purchased in the Letters of Credit; and (iii) that it will make or purchase
Revolving Loans and fund or purchase such participations for its own account in
the ordinary course of its business and without a view to distribution thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal
securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this
subsection 10.1, the disposition of such

                                     -148-
<PAGE>

Revolving Loans or participations or any interests therein shall at all times
remain within its exclusive control).

                  G.       ASSIGNMENTS TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. In addition to

and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank be considered to
be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to
take any action hereunder.

                  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

Documents (including in connection with the sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon any of the Collateral) or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases or any other
insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

         10.3.    INDEMNITY.

                  In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection
10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated,
Borrowers jointly and severally agree to defend (subject to Indemnitees'
selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless Administrative Agent,
Issuing Lender and Lenders, and the officers, directors, employees, agents and
affiliates of Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and Lenders (collectively
called the "INDEMNITEES"), including Issuing Lenders, from and against any and
all Indemnified Liabilities (as hereinafter defined); provided, that Borrowers
shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined
by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  As used herein, "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES" means, collectively,
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages (including natural
resource damages), penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims (including
Environmental Claims), costs (including the costs of any investigation, study,
sampling, testing, abatement, cleanup, removal, remediation or other response
action necessary to remove, remediate, clean up or abate any Hazardous Materials
Activity), expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall
be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses
incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect
or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws,
statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and commercial laws,
statutes, rules or regulations and Environmental Laws), on common law or
equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or
arising out of (i) this Agreement or the other Credit Documents and the Chapter
11 Cases (it being understood that such Indemnified Liabilities arising out of
the Chapter 11 Cases shall apply solely to Indemnitees in their capacities as
Administrative Agent, Lenders and Issuing Lender or officers, directors,
employees, agents and affiliates of Administrative Agent, Lenders or Issuing
Lender, and not in any other capacities) or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (including Lenders' agreement to make the Revolving Loans hereunder
or the use or intended use of the proceeds thereof or the issuance of Letters of
Credit hereunder or the use or intended use of any thereof, the failure of
Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any
act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure
or de facto Government Authority, or any enforcement of any of the Credit
Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any
of the Collateral)), (ii) the statements contained in the commitment letter
delivered by any Lender with respect thereto, or (iii) any

                                     -150-
<PAGE>

Environmental Claim or any Hazardous Materials Activity relating to or arising
from, directly or indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land
ownership, or practice of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, solely
with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date, CPIH Subsidiaries).

                  To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay
and hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in
whole or in part because they are violative of any law or public policy,
Borrowers shall contribute the maximum portion that they are permitted to pay
and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

         10.4.    SET-OFF.

                  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default each Lender is
hereby authorized by each Borrower at any time or from time to time, without
notice to each Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby
expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all
deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates
of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and
any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender or any Affiliate
of such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any other
Credit Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of any
Borrower or any other Credit Party to that Lender (or any Affiliate of such
Lender) or to any other Lender (or any Affiliate of any other Lender) under this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein and the other Credit
Documents, including all claims of any nature or description arising out of or
connected with this Agreement, the Letters of Credit and participations therein
or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not (i) any Agent or
any Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the
interest on the Revolving Loans or any amounts in respect of the Letters of
Credit or any other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable
pursuant to Section 8 and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of
them, may be contingent or unmatured. Each Borrower hereby further grants to
Administrative Agent and each Lender a security interest in all deposits and
accounts maintained with Administrative Agent or such Lender as security for the
Obligations.

         10.5.    RATABLE SHARING.

                  A.       Subject at all times to their obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement, Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of
them shall, whether by voluntary payment or mandatory payment (other than a
payment or prepayment of the Revolving Loans made and applied in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon security, through the exercise
of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by
the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents or otherwise, or as
adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy
Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of
principal, interest and other amounts payable in respect of Revolving Loans,
Letters of

                                     -151-
<PAGE>

Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or
under the other Credit Documents with respect to the Obligations (collectively,
the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) that is greater than the proportion
received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such
other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment
shall (i) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of
such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase assignments
(which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of an assignment
simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment)
of the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of
Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the
Aggregate Amounts Due to them; provided, that if all or part of such
proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter
recovered from such Lender, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase
prices paid for such assignments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender
ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Borrower
expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any purchaser of
an assignment so purchased may exercise any and all rights of a Lender as to
such assignment as fully as if that Lender had complied with the provisions of
subsection 10.1B with respect to such assignment. In order to further evidence
such assignment (and without prejudice to the effectiveness of the assignment
provisions set forth above), each purchasing Lender and each selling Lender
agree to enter into an assignment agreement at the request of a selling Lender
or a purchasing Lender, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to each such Lender and to Administrative Agent.

                  B.       Notwithstanding anything in this subsection 10.5 to
the contrary, in the event any one or more Lenders (for purposes of this
subsection 10.5, "ENFORCING LENDERS") receives any amounts that are subject to
the sharing provisions of subsection 10.5A as a result of such Enforcing Lender
or Enforcing Lenders, but not Administrative Agent or all Lenders, commencing
Proceedings to recover such amounts, no Lender that is not an Enforcing Lender
shall be entitled to the benefits of subsection 10.5A with respect to the
amounts received by such Enforcing Lenders (i) unless and until such Lender has
paid its Pro Rata Share of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses of counsel to such Enforcing Lenders) incurred by such
Enforcing Lenders in connection with such Proceedings or (ii) in any greater
amount at any time than such Lender would be entitled to receive under such
subsection if all Lenders paid their Pro Rata Shares of such costs and expenses.

         10.6.    AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

                  No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or of the Notes or the Credit Documents, and no
consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be
effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; provided, that
no such amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent shall, without
the consent of: (a) each Lender with Obligations directly affected (whose
consent shall be required for any such amendment, modification, termination or
waiver in addition to that of Requisite Lenders) (1) reduce the principal amount
of any Revolving Loan or any funded amount with respect to a participation in a
Letter of Credit,

                                     -152-
<PAGE>

(2) increase the maximum aggregate amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan
Commitment, Letter of Credit Commitment or Letters of Credit, (3) postpone the
Maturity Date or any other scheduled payment date with respect to the principal
balance of the Revolving Loans, (4) postpone the date on which any interest or
any fees are payable, (5) decrease the interest rate borne by any funded amount
with respect to a participation in a Letter of Credit or any Revolving Loan
(other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable pursuant
to subsection 2.2E, the penultimate sentence of subsection 3.2 or subsection
6.13) or the amount of any fees payable hereunder, (6) reduce the amount or
postpone the due date of any reimbursement of a drawing (other than from a
Mandatory Payment) in respect of any Letter of Credit, (7) extend the expiration
date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Maturity Date, (8) change in any manner
the obligations of Lenders relating to the purchase of participations in Letters
of Credit, or (9) change in any manner or waive the provisions contained in
subsection 8.1; (b) each Lender, (1) change in any manner the definition of "Pro
Rata Share" or the definition of "Requisite Lenders" (except for any changes
resulting solely from an increase in Letter of Credit Commitments approved by
Requisite Lenders), (2) change in any manner any provision of this Agreement
that, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of all
Lenders, (3) release any Lien granted in favor of Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral or
release any substantial portion of Borrowers from their obligations under this
Agreement, in each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Documents, or (4) change in any manner or waive the provisions contained in
subsection 10.6; (c) Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender, change in any
manner the definition of "Eligible Assignee"; (d) Administrative Agent, affect
the rights or duties of Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative
Agent) under this Agreement or any other Credit Document; and (e) Issuing
Lender, affect the rights or duties of Issuing Lender (in its capacity as
Issuing Lender) under this Agreement or any other Credit Document.

                  In addition, (i) no amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of any Note shall be effective without the written
concurrence of the Lender which is the holder of that Note, (ii) no amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of Section 3 shall be
effective without the written concurrence of Administrative Agent and, with
respect to the purchase of participations in Letters of Credit, without the
written concurrence of Issuing Lender, (iii) no amendment, modification,
termination or waiver of any provision of Section 9 or of any other provision of
this Agreement which, by its terms, expressly requires the approval or
concurrence of Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written
concurrence of Administrative Agent, as the case may be and (iii) no amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement which, by
its terms, expressly requires the approval or concurrence of Issuing Lender
shall be effective without the written concurrence of Issuing Lender.
Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence
of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf
of that Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or
demand on any Borrower or Borrowers in any case shall entitle any Borrower or
Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this

                                     -153-
<PAGE>

subsection 10.6 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each
future Lender and, if signed by Borrowers, on Borrowers. Administrative Agent
agrees that promptly after the effectiveness of any amendment, termination,
supplement, waiver or other modification of this Agreement it shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to each Lender a copy thereof to the extent such a copy is
available to Administrative Agent.

         10.7.    INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS.

                  All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so
that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such
covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would
otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the
occurrence of an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default if such action
is taken or condition exists.

         10.8.    NOTICES; EFFECTIVENESS OF SIGNATURES.

                  Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or
other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing
and may be personally served, or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or
courier service or (subject to the following paragraph of this subsection 10.8)
electronic mail and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered in
person or by courier service, (b) upon receipt of telefacsimile in complete and
legible form, (c) 3 Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail
with postage prepaid and properly addressed, or (d) in the case of
communications delivered by electronic mail to the extent provided in the
following paragraph of this subsection 10.8, as provided pursuant to such
paragraph; provided, that notices to Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender
shall not be effective until received. For the purposes hereof, the address of
each party hereto shall be as set forth under such party's name on the signature
pages hereof or (i) as to Company and Administrative Agent, such other address
as shall be designated by such Person in a written notice delivered to the other
parties hereto and (ii) as to each other party, such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice delivered to Administrative Agent.

                  Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may
be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and
Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by Administrative
Agent; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender
pursuant to Section 2 or Section 3 hereof if such Lender has notified
Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such
Section by electronic communication. Administrative Agent or any Borrower may,
in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it
hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it;
provided, that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices
or communications.

                  Credit Documents and notices under the Credit Documents may be
transmitted and/or signed by telefacsimile. The effectiveness of any such
documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable law, have the same force
and effect as an original copy with manual signatures and shall be binding on
all Credit Parties, Administrative Agent and

                                     -154-
<PAGE>

Lenders. Administrative Agent may also require that any such documents and
signature be confirmed by a manually-signed copy thereof; provided, however,
that the failure to request or deliver any such manually-signed copy shall not
affect the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

         10.9.    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.

                  A.       All representations, warranties and agreements made
herein or in any other Credit Document shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder.

                  B.       Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied
by law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrowers set forth in subsections
2.6D, 2.7, 3.5A, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.19 and 10.20 and the agreements of Lenders
set forth in subsections 9.2C, 9.4, 10.5, 10.19 and 10.20 shall survive the
payment of the Revolving Loans, the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of
Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the
termination of this Agreement (and the benefits to a Lender of such agreements
of Borrowers shall survive such Lender's ceasing to be a party hereto pursuant
to subsection 10.1B).

         10.10.   FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

                  No failure or delay on the part of Administrative Agent or any
Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any
other Credit Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be
construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other
or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

         10.11.   MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.

                  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under any
obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Company or any other party or
against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that
Company makes a payment or payments to Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or Administrative Agent or
Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and
such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any
part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common
law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation
or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and
remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

         10.12.   SEVERABILITY.

                  In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of
such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

         10.13.   OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS;
                  DAMAGE WAIVER.

                  The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender
shall be responsible for the obligations or Letter of Credit Commitments of any
other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Credit
Document, and no action taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be
deemed to constitute Lenders, or Lenders and Company, as a partnership, an
association, a Joint Venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at
any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt, and
each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of
this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to be joined
as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

                  To the extent permitted by law, each Borrower shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with or as a result
of this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any transaction contemplated by
the Credit Documents, any Letter of Credit or Revolving Loan or the use of
proceeds of drawings thereunder.

         10.14.   RELEASE OF SECURITY INTEREST.

                  Upon the proposed sale or other disposition of any Collateral
that is permitted by this Agreement or to which Requisite Lenders have otherwise
consented, for which a Credit Party desires to obtain a security interest
release from Collateral Agent, such Credit Party shall deliver to Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent an Officer's Certificate (i) stating that the
Collateral or the Capital Stock subject to such disposition is being sold or
otherwise disposed of in compliance with the terms hereof and of the Credit
Documents and (ii) specifying the Collateral or Capital Stock being sold or
otherwise disposed of in the proposed transaction. Upon the receipt of such
Officer's Certificate, Collateral Agent shall, at such Credit Party's expense,
so long as Collateral Agent (a) believes in good faith that the facts stated in
such Officer's Certificate are true and correct and (b) if the sale or other
disposition of such item of Collateral or Capital Stock constitutes an Asset
Sale, shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that arrangements
satisfactory to it have been made for delivery of the Net Asset Sale Proceeds if
and as required by subsection 2.4, execute and deliver such releases of its
security interest in such Collateral as may be reasonably requested by such
Credit Party. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this
subsection 10.14 and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.

Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

         10.19.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

                  EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE
ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON
OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR ANY
DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS CREDIT TRANSACTION
OR THE LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. The scope of this
waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be
filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction,
including contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other
common law and statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that this waiver
is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has
already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that each
will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each
party hereto further warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver
with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury
trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS
IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING
(OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION
10.19 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY
TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE CREDIT EXTENDED HEREUNDER. In the event of

         10.20.   CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained
pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement that has been identified as
confidential by Company in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures
for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Borrowers that in
any event a Lender may make (a) disclosures to Affiliates and professional
advisors of such Lender, (b) disclosures reasonably required by (i) any bona
fide assignee, transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated
assignment or transfer by such Lender of any Obligations or any participations
therein, or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or such contractual counterparties' professional advisors provided,
that such assignee, transferee, participant, contractual counterparty or
professional advisor agrees to keep such information confidential to the same
extent required of Lenders hereunder, (c) disclosures to any court or tribunal
(whether or not pursuant to subpoena) in connection with any action arising out
of or related to this Agreement, or (d) disclosures required or requested by any
Government Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process;
provided, that unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order,
each Lender shall notify Company of any request by any Government Authority or
representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with any
examination of such Lender by such Government Authority) for disclosure of any
such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information; and
provided, further, that in no event shall any Lender be obligated or required to
return any materials furnished by Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
CPIH Subsidiaries).

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, information
required to be treated as confidential by reason of the foregoing shall not
include, and Administrative Agent, each Lender and the respective Affiliates of
each of the foregoing (and the respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, advisors and other representatives of each of the foregoing
and their respective Affiliates) (collectively, the "LENDER PARTIES") may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, (x) any
information with respect to United States federal and state income tax treatment
and United States federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated
hereby and any facts that may be relevant to understanding such tax treatment,
which facts shall not include for this purpose the names of the parties or any
other Person named herein, or information that would permit identification of
the parties or such other Persons, or any pricing terms or other non-public
business or financial information that is unrelated to such tax treatment or
facts, and (y) all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) relating to such tax treatment or facts that are provided to any of
the Lender Parties.

         10.21.   NO FIDUCIARY DUTY.

                  Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has or shall have,
by reason of this Agreement or any of the Credit Documents, a fiduciary
relationship in respect of, or a fiduciary duty to, any Borrower, Borrowers, any
other Credit Party or Credit Parties, and the relationship between
Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and each Borrower, on the other
hand, in connection herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor.

         10.22.   COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS.

                  This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or
supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument;
signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached
to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to
the same document. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution of a
counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto.

         10.23.   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.

                  Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees and Released Parties related to
Administrative Agent, and Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.
