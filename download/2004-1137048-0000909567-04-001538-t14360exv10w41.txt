                                       22

(vi) the words "asset" and "property" shall be construed to have the same
meaning and effect and to refer to any and all tangible and intangible assets
and properties, including cash, securities, accounts and contract rights.

         (b)  In the computation of periods of time from a specified date to a
later specified date, the word "from" means "from and including;" the words "to"
and "until" each mean "to but excluding;" and the word "through" means "to and
including."

         (c)  Section headings herein and in the other Loan Documents are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the
interpretation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

         SECTION 1.03.  ACCOUNTING TERMS.

         (a)  Generally. All accounting terms not specifically or completely
defined herein shall be construed in conformity with, and all financial data
(including financial ratios and other financial calculations) required to be
submitted pursuant to this Agreement shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP
or Statutory Accounting Practices, as the case may be, applied on a consistent
basis, as in effect from time to time, applied in a manner consistent with that
used in preparing the Audited Financial Statements, except as otherwise
specifically prescribed herein.

         (b)  Changes in GAAP or Statutory Accounting Practices. If at any time
any change in GAAP or Statutory Accounting Practices, as the case may be, would
affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any
Loan Document, and either the Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request,
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good
faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof
in light of such change in GAAP or Statutory Accounting Practices, as the case
may be, (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until
so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in
accordance with GAAP or Statutory Accounting Practices, as the case may be,
prior to such change therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and other documents
required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth
a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before
and after giving effect to such change in GAAP or Statutory Accounting
Practices, as the case may be.

         SECTION 1.04.  ROUNDING.  Any financial ratios required to be
maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by
dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result
to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed
herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a
rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

         SECTION 1.05.  TIMES OF DAY.  Unless otherwise specified, all
references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight
or standard, as applicable).

         SECTION 1.06.  LETTER OF CREDIT AMOUNTS.  Unless otherwise specified
herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to mean be
the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided,
however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the
terms of any Letter of Credit Application related thereto, provides


                                       23

<PAGE>

for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of
such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such
Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such
maximum stated amount is in effect at such time.

                                  ARTICLE II.
                      THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

         SECTION 2.01.  REVOLVING LOANS.  Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a
"Revolving Loan") to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during
the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time
outstanding the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that
after giving effect to any Revolving Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall
not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount
of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage
of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, shall not exceed such Lender's
Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, and subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section
2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Revolving
Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided
herein.

         SECTION 2.02.  BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF REVOLVING
LOANS.

         (a)  Each Revolving Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans from
one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
made upon the Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which
may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three Business Days prior to
the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate
Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each
telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be
confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written
Revolving Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections
2.03(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.
Each Revolving Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i)
whether the Borrower is requesting a Revolving Borrowing, a conversion of
Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as
the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of
Revolving Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of
Revolving Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Revolving Loans are to be
converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with
respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Revolving Loan in a
Revolving Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Loans
shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic
conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the
Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate
Loans. If the Borrower


                                       24

<PAGE>

requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans
in any such Revolving Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it
will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

         (b)  Following receipt of a Revolving Loan Notice, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable
Percentage of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely notice of a
conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Revolving
Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to
the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Revolving Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit
Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so
received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of
such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and
reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided,
however, that if, on the date the Revolving Loan Notice with respect to such
Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then
the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full
of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower
as provided above.

         (c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders.

         (d)  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that
Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America's prime rate used in
determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such
change.

         (e)  After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions
of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of
Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest
Periods in effect with respect to Revolving Loans.

         SECTION 2.03.  LETTERS OF CREDIT.

         (a)  The Letter of Credit Commitment.

              (i)  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the
L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set
forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the
period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to
issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Letter of Credit Obligors, and to
amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with


                                       25

<PAGE>

subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and
(B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for
the account of the Letter of Credit Obligors and any drawings thereunder;
provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to
any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate
Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any
Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of
all L/C Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment, and (z) the
Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit
Sublimit. Each request by a Letter of Credit Obligor for the issuance or
amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by such
Letter of Credit Obligor that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies
with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within
the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
Letter of Credit Obligor's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully
revolving, and accordingly the Letter of Credit Obligors may, during the
foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that
have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. Each Letter of Credit
(other than an Existing Letter of Credit) shall be a Secured Letter of Credit;
provided however that each such Secured Letter of Credit shall comply with the
provisions of Section 2.03(m) hereof throughout the entire term of such Letter
of Credit. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued
pursuant hereto and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and
governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

                (ii)   The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:

                       (A)  subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of
                such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve
                months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the
                Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or

                       (B)  the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit
                would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless
                all the Lenders have approved such expiry date.

                (iii)  The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue
any Letter of Credit if:

                       (A)  any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
                Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
                restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or
                any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive
                (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
                Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit,
                or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of
                letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in
                particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to
                such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
                requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise
                compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or
                shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or
                expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which
                the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;


                                       26

<PAGE>

                       (B)  the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate
                one or more policies of the L/C Issuer;

                       (C)  except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative
                Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial
                stated amount less than $200,000;

                       (D)  such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a
                currency other than Dollars;

                       (E)  such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for
                automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing
                thereunder; or

                       (F)  a default of any Lender's obligations to fund under
                Section 2.03(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a
                Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has entered
                into satisfactory arrangements with the Letter of Credit Obligor
                or such Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer's risk with respect
                to such Lender.

                (iv)   The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if
the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of
Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.

                (v)    The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any
Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to
issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B)
the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment
to such Letter of Credit.

                (vi)   The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with
respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated
therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A)
provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of
Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Letter of Credit
Applications pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
"Administrative Agent" as used in Article IX included the L/C Issuer with
respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with
respect to the L/C Issuer.

         (b)    Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.

                (i)    Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the
case may be, upon the request of a Letter of Credit Obligor delivered to the L/C
Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of
Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer
of such Letter of Credit Obligor. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00
a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the
Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their
sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as
the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of
Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested
Letter of Credit


                                       27

<PAGE>

(which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date
thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents
to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the
full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any
drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In
the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such
Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of
amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the
proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.
Additionally, the Letter of Credit Obligor shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and
the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such
requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer
Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may require.

                (ii)   Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by
telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of
such Letter of Credit Application from the Letter of Credit Obligor and, if not,
the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless
the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative
Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date
of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more
applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the
requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable
Letter of Credit Obligor or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may
be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary
business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an
amount equal to the product of such Lender's Applicable Percentage times the
amount of such Letter of Credit.

                (iii)  If the Letter of Credit Obligor so requests in any
applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and
absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic
extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of Credit"); provided that
any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent
any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with
the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the
beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in
each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of
Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Letter of
Credit Obligor shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C
Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been
issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the
L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an
expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided,
however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C
Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no
obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as
extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or
clause (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice
(which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five
Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative
Agent that the Required


                                       28

<PAGE>

Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the Letter of Credit Obligor that one or more of the
applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in
each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

                (iv)   Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or
to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Letter of
Credit Obligor and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such
Letter of Credit or amendment.

         (c)    Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                (i)    Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit
of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
notify the Letter of Credit Obligor which requested the issuance of such Letter
of Credit and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the
date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date,
an "Honor Date"), such Letter of Credit Obligor shall reimburse the L/C Issuer
through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such
drawing. If such Letter of Credit Obligor fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer
by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"),
and the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event,
the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the
Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the
amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Revolving Loan Notice).
Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in
writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not
affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

                (ii)   Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section
2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an amount equal to its
Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes
funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in
such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the
L/C Issuer.

                (iii)  With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully
refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the
Letter of Credit Obligor for whose account that such Letter of Credit was issued
shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the
amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing
shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the
Administrative Agent for the


                                       29

<PAGE>

account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed
payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation
obligation under this Section 2.03.

                (iv)   Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance
pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount
drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C
Issuer.

                (v)    Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C
Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit,
as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
against the L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit Obligor or any other Person for any
reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any
other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving
Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Revolving Loan Notice).
No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the
obligation of such Letter of Credit Obligor to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the
amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit,
together with interest as provided herein.

                (vi)   If any Lender fails to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be
paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c)
by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled
to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on
demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds
Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to
any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing
under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d)    Repayment of Participations.

                (i)    At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under
any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance
in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the
Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in
respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly
from Letter of Credit Obligor or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash
Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative
Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof
(appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period
of time during which such Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same
funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

                (ii)   If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be
returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion),
each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent,
plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is
returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause
shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.

         (e)    Obligations Absolute. The obligation of each Letter of Credit
Obligor to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit
issued for such Letter of Credit Obligor's account and the obligation of each
Letter of Credit Obligor to repay each L/C Borrowing with respect to each Letter
of Credit issued for such Letter of Credit Obligor's account shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:

                (i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of
Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;

                (ii)   the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense
or other right that any Letter of Credit Obligor may have at any time against
any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for
whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer
or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                (iii)  any draft, demand, certificate or other document
presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid
or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise
of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                (iv)   any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer
under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in
bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary
or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection
with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

                (v)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Letter
of Credit Obligor.

         The Letter of Credit Obligor shall promptly examine a copy of each
Letter of Credit issued for its account and each amendment thereto that is
delivered to it and, in the event of any


                                       31

<PAGE>

claim of noncompliance with the Letter of Credit Obligor's instructions or other
irregularity, the Letter of Credit Obligor will immediately notify the L/C
Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Obligor shall be conclusively deemed to have
waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such
notice is given as aforesaid.

         (f)    Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and each Letter of Credit
Obligor agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C
Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any
sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of
Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such
document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such
document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their
respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the
L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in
connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the
Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,
effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related
to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. Each Letter of Credit
Obligor hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however,
that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude each Letter of
Credit Obligor from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the
beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C
Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor
any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or
responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of
Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, a Letter of Credit Obligor may have a claim against
the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to a Letter of Credit Obligor,
to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by a Letter of Credit Obligor which
such Letter of Credit Obligor proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful
misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under
any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight
draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a
Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C
Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g)    Cash or Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative
Agent, (i) if, an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) if,
as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason
remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately (A) Cash
Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations or (B)
otherwise fully secure the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations by
delivering to the Collateral Agent L/C Collateral in an amount equal to the
Collateral Value of such L/C Collateral multiplied by the Collateral Coverage
Percentage for such type of L/C Collateral. Sections 2.05 and 8.02(c) set forth
certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For
purposes of this Section 2.03, Section 2.05 and Section 8.02(c), "Cash
Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative
Agent, for the


                                       32

<PAGE>

benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C
Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form
and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which
documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders); provided that such cash shall
be multiplied by the applicable Collateral Coverage Percentage. Derivatives of
such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a
security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein
and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in
blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.

         (h)    Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the
L/C Issuer and the Letter of Credit Obligor when a Letter of Credit is issued
(including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the
rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit.

         (i)    Letter of Credit Fees. Each Letter of Credit Obligor shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with
its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee")
(i) for each Secured Letter of Credit issued for such Letter of Credit Obligor's
account equal to .30 of 1% per annum times the daily maximum amount available to
be drawn under such Secured Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount
is then in effect under such Letter of Credit), and (ii) for each Unsecured
Letter of Credit issued for such Letter of Credit Obligor's account equal to the
Applicable Rate times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Unsecured Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available
to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit
shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall
be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the
first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter
of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If
there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount
available to be drawn under each Unsecured Letter of Credit shall be computed
and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such
quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any
Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default
Rate. For purposes of calculating the Letter of Credit Fee, for any day that
there is a Collateral Deficiency with respect to a Secured Letter of Credit such
Secured Letter of Credit will be deemed to be an Unsecured Letter of Credit on
such day.

         (j)    Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to
L/C Issuer. Each Letter of Credit Obligor shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer
for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the
rate per annum equal to 0.125%, computed on the daily amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit and on a quarterly basis in arrears, and due
and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June,
September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be
drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In


                                       33

<PAGE>

addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account
the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and
other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of
credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs
and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.

         (k)    Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

         (l)    Letters of Credit Issued for Letter of Credit Obligors that are
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding
hereunder may be in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a
Letter of Credit Obligor that is a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be jointly and
severally obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all
drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the
issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Letter of Credit Obligors that
are Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower's
business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.

         (m)    Secured Letters of Credit.

                (i)    Prior to the issuance of each Secured Letter of Credit,
the Letter of Credit Obligor shall have pledged and deposited with or delivered
to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders (or
otherwise subject to a custodial agent control agreement or other agreement by
which the Collateral Agent has a perfected first Lien in the L/C Collateral),
L/C Collateral for each such Secured Letter of Credit pursuant to documentation
in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the L/C Issuer
(which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). The L/C Collateral
Balance for each such Secured Letter of Credit shall be no less than the face
amount of such Secured Letter of Credit. To the extent that the L/C Obligor of
such Secured Letter of Credit has not (A) delivered L/C Collateral consisting of
certificated securities or instruments into the possession of the Collateral
Agent to the extent such securities or instruments are not book-entry
instruments, (B) obtained the written agreement of any bailee or securities
intermediary in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent with
respect to any L/C Collateral, or (C) taken any other action required by the
Collateral Agent with respect to the L/C Collateral, the Administrative Agent,
in its sole discretion, may exclude from the calculations of L/C Collateral
Balance, the Collateral Value of any such L/C Collateral until the Letter of
Credit Obligor has complied with this Section 2.03(m)(i) to the sole
satisfaction of the Administrative Agent. Each Letter of Credit Obligor hereby
grants to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders, a security interest in all L/C Collateral and all proceeds of the
foregoing to secure all obligations of such Letter of Credit Obligor hereunder
in respect of Secured Letters of Credit issued for such Letter of Credit
Obligor's account.

                (ii)   If, at any time, (A) the L/C Collateral Balance for any
Secured Letter of Credit is less than the face amount of such Secured Letter of
Credit (a "Collateral Deficiency"), the Letter of Credit Obligor in respect of
such Secured Letter of Credit shall no later than fourteen (14) days from the
date of notice thereof by the Administrative Agent, pledge additional L/C
Collateral to cure such Collateral Deficiency. If such Letter of Credit Obligor
fails to pledge


                                       34

<PAGE>

additional L/C Collateral for such Secured Letter of Credit within the time
provided above, the Administrative Agent may immediately (A) designate such
Secured Letter of Credit an Unsecured Letter of Credit and (B) exercise its
rights and remedies set forth in Section 8.02(b) hereof, including without
limitation, liquidating all or part of the L/C Collateral for such Secured
Letter of Credit.

                (iii)  The Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, no later than 3 p.m.
Dallas, Texas time on the Monday of each week, with respect to each Secured
Letter of Credit, a report listing the L/C Collateral Balance for such Secured
Letter of Credit as of the Friday of the prior week.

         SECTION 2.04.  TERM OUT.

         (a)    Term-Out Option. On the Maturity Date, provided that (i) no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the
Maturity Date, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which are qualified as to
materiality are true and correct, and such representations and warranties which
are not qualified as to materiality are true and correct in all material
respects, in each case on and as of the Maturity Date, as though made on and as
of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to
have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date) and (iii) the
Term Out Premium is paid on the Maturity Date, the Borrower shall have the
option (which shall not require the consent of any Lender) to convert all or a
portion of the Revolving Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date to term loans
(the "Term Loans"); provided, however, that the aggregate amount of the
Revolving Loans that may be converted to Term Loans shall not be less than
$5,000,000. Such election must be made no sooner than 45 days prior to the
Maturity Date, and no later than 35 days prior to the Maturity Date (or such
shorter period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent), by written notice to
the Administrative Agent of the election of such conversion (the "Term Out
Notice") in accordance with the terms of Section 10.02 hereof specifying the
principal amount of the Revolving Loans which the Borrower desires to convert to
Term Loans (the "Conversion Amount"). Promptly following its receipt of the Term
Out Notice, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy of the Term Out Notice to
each of the Lenders.

         (b)    Term Loans. Prior to the Maturity Date, to the extent requested
by each Lender in connection with the conversion of the Revolving Loans to Term
Loans, the Borrower shall execute and deliver new promissory notes to each
Lender in the form required by the Administrative Agent (the "Term Notes"). If
the Borrower has given the Term Out Notice, the lesser of (i) the Conversion
Amount and (ii) the Revolving Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date shall
automatically convert to Term Loans on the Maturity Date with each Lender being
deemed to have made its Applicable Percentage of such Term Loans, and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the principal amount
thereof. The principal amount of the Term Loans shall be due and payable on the
Term Loan Maturity Date, unless such Term Loans shall sooner become due and
payable pursuant to Section 8.02 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. The
Term Loans shall be either Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans, with
interest accruing and being paid in the same manner as Revolving Loans, and with
the Term Loans to be designated as, continued as, or converted into Eurodollar
Rate Loans in the same


                                       35

<PAGE>

manner as Revolving Loans could be designated as, continued as, or converted
into Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as provided in Section 2.02.

         (c)    Term Out Premium. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, a fee (the "Term Out Premium") equal to 0.25% times the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans that are converted to Term Loans
on the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.04. The Term Out Premium shall
be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

         SECTION 2.05.  PREPAYMENTS.

         (a)    The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at
any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or in
part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received
by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days
prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of
prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof
or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.
Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the
Type(s) of Revolving Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly
notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by
the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued
interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required
pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Revolving
Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

         (b)    If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay
Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to
Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) unless
after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

         SECTION 2.06.  TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.  The Borrower
may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate
Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments;
provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent
not later than 11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or
reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) the
Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after
giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total
Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments. The Administrative Agent
will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction
of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall
be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to such Lender's


                                       36

<PAGE>

Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective date of any
termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of
such termination.

         SECTION 2.07.  REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

         (a)    The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

         (b)    The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Term Loan
Maturity Date the aggregate amount of Term Loans outstanding on such date.

         SECTION 2.08.  INTEREST.

         (a)    Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate
Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate.

         (b)    (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due
(without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

                (ii)   If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable
by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to
any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall
thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times
equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

                (iii)  Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event
of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of
all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum
at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws.

                (iv)   Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts
(including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

         (c)    Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

         SECTION 2.09.  FEES.  In addition to certain fees described in
subsections (i) and (j) of Section 2.03 and subsection (c) of Section 2.04:


                                       37

<PAGE>

         (a)    Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to 0.225% times the
actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the
Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
Obligations. The Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the
Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Maturity Date. The Commitment Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and
if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual
daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately
for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

         (b)    Other Fees.  (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the
Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and
at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when
paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

                (ii)   The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall
have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so
specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable
for any reason whatsoever.

         SECTION 2.10.  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.  All computations of
interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of
America's "prime rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and
interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed
(which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if
computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for
the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any
portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided
that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject
to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.11.  EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a)    The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender


                                       38

<PAGE>

(through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's
Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules
to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and
maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

         (b)    In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases
and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of
any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative
Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the
accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error.

         SECTION 2.12.  PAYMENTS GENERALLY; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK.

         (a)    General.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or
setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the
Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative
Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00
p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly
distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share
as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer
to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business
Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment
to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

         (b)    (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior
to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Revolving
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available
funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to
the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such
Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the
interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender
shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an
overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If
such Lender pays its share of the applicable committed Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's


                                       39

<PAGE>

Revolving Loan included in such Revolving Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower
shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender
that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

                (ii)   Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative
Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case
may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

         (c)   Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent.  If any Lender makes
available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such
Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such
funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because
the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are
not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative
Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
such Lender, without interest.

         (d)   Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders
hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit
and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The
failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation
or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder
shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on
such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make
its payment under Section 10.04(c).

         (e)   Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any
Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to
constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

         SECTION 2.13.  SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS.  If any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by
it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such
Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of


                                       40

<PAGE>

such Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than
its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and
(b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and
subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and
other amounts owing them, provided that:

                (i)    if any such participations or subparticipations are
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

                (ii)   the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to
apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with
the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Revolving Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or
participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which
the provisions of this Section shall apply).

         The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
such participation.

         SECTION 2.14.  EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE.

         (a)    Requests for Extension.  The Borrower may, by notice to the
Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), not earlier than
45 days and not later than 35 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect
hereunder (the "Existing Maturity Date"), request that each Lender extend such
Lender's Maturity Date for an additional 364 days from the Existing Maturity
Date.

         (b)    Lender Elections to Extend.  Each Lender, acting in its sole and
individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not
earlier than 30 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date and not later than the
date (the "Notice Date"), that is 20 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date,
advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such
extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a
"Non-Extending Lender") shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact
promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice
Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or
before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The
election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other
Lender to so agree.


                                       41

<PAGE>

         (c)    Notification by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrower of each Lender's determination under this Section no
later than the date 15 days prior to the Existing Maturity Date (or, if such
date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).

         (d)    Additional Commitment Lenders.  The Borrower shall have the
right on or before the Existing Maturity Date to replace each Non-Extending
Lender with, and add as "Lenders" under this Agreement in place thereof, one or
more Eligible Assignees (each, an "Additional Commitment Lender") as provided in
Section 10.13, each of which Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered
into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment
Lender shall, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, undertake a Commitment
(and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its
Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender's Commitment hereunder on such
date).

         (e)    Minimum Extension Requirement.  If (and only if) the total of
the Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed so to extend their Maturity Date
and the additional Commitments of the Additional Commitment Lenders shall, in
the aggregate, equal or exceed $100,000,000, then, effective as of the Existing
Maturity Date, the Maturity Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional
Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling 364 days after the
Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such
Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each
Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a "Lender" for all purposes
of this Agreement.

         (f)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section shall not
be effective with respect to any Lender unless:

                (i)    no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto;

                (ii)   the representations and warranties of the Borrower
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are qualified as
to materiality are true and correct, and such representations and warranties
which are not qualified as to materiality are true and correct in all material
respects, in each case on and as of the date of such extension and after giving
effect thereto, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such
representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a
specific date, as of such specific date); and

                (iii)  on the Maturity Date of each Non-Extending Lender, the
Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to
keep outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages
of the respective Lenders effective as of such date.

         (g)    Conflicting Provisions.  This Section shall supersede any
provisions in Section 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary.


                                       42

<PAGE>

         SECTION 2.15.  INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS.

         (a)    Request for Increase.  Provided there exists no Default, upon
notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders),
the Borrower may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate
Commitments by an amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $35,000,000;
provided that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount
of $5,000,000 and (ii) upon the increase of the Aggregate Commitments to a total
amount in excess of $100,000,000, Bank of America's Commitment shall be
decreased by $5,000,000. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in
consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within
which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than
ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).

         (b)    Lender Elections to Increase.  Each Lender shall notify the
Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to
increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than,
or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender
not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to
increase its Commitment.

         (c)    Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders.  The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders'
responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a
requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and
the L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the
Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders
pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and its counsel.

         (d)    Effective Date and Allocations.  If the Aggregate Commitments
are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and
the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and
the Increase Effective Date.

         (e)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase.  As a condition
precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date
(in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such
Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan
Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the
Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A)
the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan
Document which are qualified as to materiality are true and correct, and the
representations and warranties which are not qualified as to materiality are
true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of the
Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true
and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.15, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a)
and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements
furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and
(B) no Default exists. The Borrower shall


                                       43

<PAGE>

prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay
any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent
necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised
Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments
under this Section.

         (f)    Conflicting Provisions.  This Section shall supersede any
provisions in Sections 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary.


                                  ARTICLE III.
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

         SECTION 3.01.  TAXES.

         (a)    Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be
required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other
Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative
Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

         (b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  Without limiting the
provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other
Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c)    Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10 days after
demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative
Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any penalties,
interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to
the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or
the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C
Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d)    Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment
of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority,
the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.


                                       44

<PAGE>

         (e)    Status of Lenders.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such
jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed
and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In
addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender
is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the
Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but
only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the
following is applicable:

                (i)    duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
United States is a party,

                (ii)   duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI,

                (iii)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of
the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a
certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within
the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder"
of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a
"controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code
and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or

                (iv)   any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis
for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding
tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding
or deduction required to be made.

                (f)    Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an
amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made,
or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to
the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case
may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower,
upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
agrees to repay the


                                       45

<PAGE>

amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent,
such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender
or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.

         SECTION 3.02.  ILLEGALITY.  If any Lender determines that any Law has
made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or
fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon
the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material
restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take
deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by
such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of
such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate
Revolving Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender
notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such
Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate
Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

         SECTION 3.03.  INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES.  If the Required Lenders
determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar
Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits
are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the
applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate
and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
(c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so
notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders
to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such
notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request
for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

         SECTION 3.04.  INCREASED COSTS.

         (a)    Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall

                (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or


                                       46

<PAGE>

for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except
any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer;

                (ii)   subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any
kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any
participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change
the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect
thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and
the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by
such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or

                (iii)  impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London
interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement
or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation
therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or
of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of
Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender, or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other
amount) then upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will
pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be,
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

         (b)    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or the L/C Issuer
determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any
Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding
company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on
the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made
by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters
of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or
the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or
the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or
such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

         (c)    Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender or
the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as
specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or
the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.


                                       47

<PAGE>

         (d)    Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender
or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's
right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be
required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions
suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C
Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in
Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof).

         (e)    Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.  The Borrower shall pay to
each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds
or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest
on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual
costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by
such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall
be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.
If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment
Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of
such notice.

         SECTION 3.05.  COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES.  Upon demand of any Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall
promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss,
cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

         (a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of
acceleration, or otherwise);

         (b)    any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the
Borrower; or

         (c)    any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the
last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank


                                       48

<PAGE>

eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether
or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

         SECTION 3.06.  MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

         (a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04,
as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant
to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

         (b)    Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount
to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance
with Section 10.13.

         SECTION 3.07.  SURVIVAL. All of the Borrower's obligations under this
Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment
of all other Obligations hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE IV.
                    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS

         SECTION 4.01.  CONDITIONS OF INITIAL CREDIT EXTENSION.  The obligation
of the L/C Issuer and each Lender to make its initial Credit Extension hereunder
is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

         (a)    The Administrative Agent's receipt of the following, each of
which shall be originals or telecopies (followed promptly by originals) unless
otherwise specified, each properly executed by a Responsible Officer of the

of governmental officials, a recent date before the Closing Date) and each in
form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each of the
Lenders:

                (i)    executed counterparts of this Agreement and the Security
Agreement sufficient in number for distribution to the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Borrower;

                (ii)   a Revolving Note executed by the Borrower in favor of
each Lender requesting a Revolving Note;

                (iii)  such certificates of resolutions or other action,
incumbency certificates and/or other certificates of Responsible Officers of
each Loan Party as the Administrative Agent


                                       49

<PAGE>

may require evidencing the identity, authority and capacity of each Responsible
Officer thereof authorized to act as a Responsible Officer in connection with
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party;

                (iv)   such documents and certifications as the Administrative
Agent may reasonably require to evidence that each Loan Party is duly organized
or formed, and that each of the Borrower and each other Letter of Credit Obligor
is validly existing, in good standing and qualified to engage in business in
each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of properties or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that
failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect;

                (v)    a favorable opinion of (x) Donald L. Smith, counsel to
the Borrower, OARC and Clearwater and (y) Peter H. Lovell, counsel to Hudson and
Hudson Specialty, each addressed to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as
to the matters concerning the Loan Parties and the Loan Documents as the
Required Lenders may reasonably request;

                (vi)   a certificate of a Responsible Officer of each Loan Party
either (A) attaching copies of all consents, licenses and approvals required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance by such Loan Party and
the validity against such Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a
party, and such consents, licenses and approvals shall be in full force and
effect, or (B) stating that no such consents, licenses or approvals are so
required;

                (vii)  a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower certifying (A) that the conditions specified in Sections 4.02(a) and

reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect;

                (viii) a duly completed Compliance Certificate as of the last
day of the fiscal quarter of the Borrower most recently ended prior to the
Closing Date, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower; and

                (ix)   such other assurances, certificates, documents, consents
or opinions as the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Required Lenders
reasonably may require.

         (b)    Any fees required to be paid on or before the Closing Date shall
have been paid.

         (c)    Unless waived by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall
have paid all fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative
Agent to the extent invoiced prior to or on the Closing Date, plus such
additional amounts of such fees, charges and disbursements as shall constitute
its reasonable estimate of such fees, charges and disbursements incurred or to
be incurred by it through the closing proceedings (provided that such estimate
shall not thereafter preclude a final settling of accounts between the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent).

         (d)    The Closing Date shall have occurred on or before September 30,
2004.

         Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 9.04, for
purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section
4.01, each Lender that has


                                       50

<PAGE>

signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted
or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the
proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.

         SECTION 4.02.  CONDITIONS TO ALL CREDIT EXTENSIONS.  The obligation of
each Lender to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Revolving
Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Revolving Loans to the other Type,
or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans) is subject to the following
conditions precedent:

         (a)    The representations and warranties of the Borrower and each
other Loan Party contained in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are
contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith
or therewith which are qualified as to materiality shall be true and correct,
and the representations and warranties which are not qualified as to materiality
shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of
the date of such Credit Extension, except to the extent that such
representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which
case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for
purposes of this Section 4.02, the representations and warranties contained in
subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most
recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of
Section 6.01.

         (b)    No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed
Credit Extension or from the application of the proceeds thereof.

         (c)    The Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the L/C Issuer
shall have received a Request for Credit Extension in accordance with the
requirements hereof.

         Each Request for Credit Extension (other than a Revolving Loan Notice
requesting only a conversion of Revolving Loans to the other Type or a
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans) submitted by the Borrower shall be deemed
to be a representation and warranty that the conditions specified in Sections
4.02(a) and (b) have been satisfied on and as of the date of the applicable
Credit Extension.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders that:

         SECTION 5.01.  EXISTENCE, QUALIFICATION AND POWER; COMPLIANCE WITH
LAWS.  Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary thereof (a) is duly organized or
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its incorporation or organization, (b) has all requisite power and authority
and all requisite governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
to (i) own its assets and carry on its business and (ii) execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party, (c) is
duly qualified and is licensed and in good standing under the Laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of properties or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, and (d) is in
compliance with all Laws; except in each case referred to in clause (b)(i), (c)
or (d), to


                                       51

<PAGE>

the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.02.  AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION.  The execution,
delivery and performance by each Loan Party of each Loan Document to which such
Person is party, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
organizational action, and do not and will not (a) contravene the terms of any
of such Person's Organization Documents; (b) conflict with or result in any
breach or contravention of, or the creation of any Lien under, or require any
payment to be made under (i) any Contractual Obligation to which such Person is
a party or affecting such Person or the properties of such Person or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) any order, injunction, writ or decree of any Governmental
Authority or any arbitral award to which such Person or its property is subject;
or (c) violate any Law. Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary thereof is in
compliance with all Contractual Obligations referred to in clause (b)(i), except
to the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.03.  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION; OTHER CONSENTS.  No
approval, consent, exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to,
or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is necessary or
required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or
enforcement against, any Loan Party of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

         SECTION 5.04.  BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement has been, and each other
Loan Document, when delivered hereunder, will have been, duly executed and
delivered by each Loan Party that is party thereto. This Agreement constitutes,
and each other Loan Document when so delivered will constitute, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against each Loan Party
that is party thereto in accordance with its terms.

         SECTION 5.05.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

         (a)    The Audited Financial Statements (i) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as
otherwise expressly noted therein; (ii) fairly present the financial condition
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their results of
operations for the period covered thereby in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein; and (iii) show all material indebtedness and other liabilities,
direct or contingent, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date
thereof, including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and Indebtedness.

         (b)    The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries dated June 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income or operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal quarter
ended on that date (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein, and (ii) fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their results of operations for
the period covered thereby, subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the
absence of footnotes and to normal year-end audit adjustments. Schedule 5.05
sets forth all material indebtedness and other liabilities,


                                       52

<PAGE>

direct or contingent, of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
the date of such financial statements, including liabilities for taxes, material
commitments and Indebtedness.

         (c)    The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Administrative
Agent copies of the Annual Statements of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2003, and the Quarterly Statements of each of the Insurance
Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2004, each as filed with the relevant Insurance
Regulatory Authority (collectively, the "Historical Statutory Statements"). The
Historical Statutory Statements (including, without limitation, the provisions
made therein for investments and the valuation thereof, reserves, policy and
contract claims and statutory liabilities) have been prepared in accordance with
Statutory Accounting Practices, were in compliance with applicable Requirements
of Law when filed and present fairly the financial condition of the respective
Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby as of the respective dates thereof and
the results of operations, changes in capital and surplus and cash flow of the
respective Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby for the respective periods
then ended. Except for liabilities and obligations disclosed or provided for in
the Historical Statutory Statements (including, without limitation, reserves,
policy and contract claims and statutory liabilities), no Insurance Subsidiary
had, as of the date of its respective Historical Statutory Statements, any
material liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) that, in accordance with
Statutory Accounting Practices, would have been required to have been disclosed
or provided for in such Historical Statutory Statements. All books of account of
each Insurance Subsidiary fully and fairly disclose all of its material
transactions, properties, assets, investments, liabilities, and obligations, are
in its possession and are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

         (d)    Since the date of the Audited Financial Statements, there has
been no event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.06.  LITIGATION.  There are no actions, suits, proceedings,
claims or disputes pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower after due and
diligent investigation, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in
arbitration or before any Governmental Authority, by or against the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or against any of their properties or revenues that (a)
purport to affect or pertain to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) either individually or in
the aggregate, if determined adversely, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.07.  NO DEFAULT.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is
in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation that could,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing or would
result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other Loan Document.

         SECTION 5.08.  OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS.  Each of the Borrower and
each Subsidiary has good record and marketable title in fee simple to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all real property necessary or used in the ordinary
conduct of its business, except for such defects in title as could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material


                                       53

<PAGE>

Adverse Effect. The property of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is subject to
no Liens, other than Liens permitted by Section 7.01.

         SECTION 5.09.  INSURANCE.  The properties of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies not Affiliates of the Borrower, in such amounts, with such deductibles
and covering such risks as are customarily carried by companies engaged in
similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where the
Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary operates, except as could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.10.  TAXES.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all
Federal, state and other material tax returns and reports required to be filed,
and have paid all Federal, state and other material taxes, assessments, fees and
other governmental charges levied or imposed upon them or their properties,
income or assets otherwise due and payable, except those which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and for
which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP or Statutory
Accounting Practices, as applicable. There is no proposed tax assessment against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary that would, if made, have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.10, neither any Loan Party nor any
Subsidiary thereof is party to any tax sharing agreement.

         SECTION 5.11.  ERISA COMPLIANCE.

         (a)    Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Federal or state Laws. Each
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter
is currently being processed by the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or cause
the loss of, such qualification. The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have made
all required contributions to each Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, and
no application for a funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Plan.

         (b)    There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any Plan that could be reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the
fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c)    (i)    No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur; (ii) no Pension Plan has (x) failed to meet the minimum funding
requirements of Section 412 of the Code or (y) any Unfunded Pension Liability
that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (iii)
neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects
to incur, any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan
(other than premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA); (iv)
neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects
to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which, with the giving of
notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability) under
Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a


                                       54

<PAGE>

Multiemployer Plan; and (v) neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in a transaction that could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA.

         SECTION 5.12.  SUBSIDIARIES; EQUITY INTERESTS.  As of the Closing Date,
the Borrower has no Subsidiaries other than those specifically disclosed in Part
(a) of Schedule 5.12, and all of the outstanding Equity Interests in such
Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are
owned by a Loan Party in the amounts specified on Part (a) of Schedule 5.12 free
and clear of all Liens. Other than (i) stock and other instruments traded on
national exchanges and (ii) equity investments in a corporation or an entity
totaling less than 10% of outstanding Equity Interests of such corporation or
entity, the Borrower has no equity investments in any other corporation or
entity other than those specifically disclosed in Part(b) of Schedule 5.12. All
of the outstanding Equity Interests in the Borrower have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable.

         SECTION 5.13.  MARGIN REGULATIONS; INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC
UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT.

         (a)    The Borrower is not engaged and will not engage, principally or
as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying
margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U issued by the FRB), or
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock.
Following the application of the proceeds of each Borrowing or drawing under
each Letter of Credit, not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of
the Borrower only or of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis) subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 or Section 7.05 or subject to
any restriction contained in any agreement or instrument between the Borrower
and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender relating to Indebtedness and
within the scope of Section 8.01(e) will be margin stock.

         (b)    None of the Borrower, any Person Controlling the Borrower, or
any Subsidiary (i) is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, or (ii) is or is required to be registered as an
"investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

         SECTION 5.14.  DISCLOSURE.  The Borrower has disclosed to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate
or other restrictions to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all
other matters known to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No report,
financial statement, certificate or other information furnished (whether in
writing or orally) by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the
negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan
Document (in each case, as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
be reasonable at the time.


                                       55

<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.15.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Each of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of
all Laws (including Environmental Laws) and all orders, writs, injunctions and
decrees applicable to it or to its properties, except in such instances in which
(a) such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted or (b)
the failure to comply therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.16.  SOLVENT.  The Borrower is, and the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are on a consolidated basis, Solvent.

         SECTION 5.17.  LICENSES.  Schedule 5.17 lists, with respect to each
Insurance Subsidiary, as of the Closing Date, all of the jurisdictions in which
such Insurance Subsidiary holds licenses (including, without limitation,
licenses or certificates of authority from relevant Insurance Regulatory
Authorities), permits or authorizations to transact insurance and reinsurance
business (collectively, the "Licenses"), and indicates the line or lines of
insurance in which each such Insurance Subsidiary is permitted to be engaged
with respect to each License therein listed. No License, the loss of which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is the subject of
proceeding for suspension, revocation or limitation or any similar proceedings.
To the Borrower's knowledge, there is no sustainable basis for such a
suspension, revocation or limitation, and no such suspension, revocation or
limitation is threatened by any relevant Insurance Regulatory Authority. No
Insurance Subsidiary transacts as of the Closing Date any insurance business,
directly or indirectly, in any jurisdiction other than those listed on Schedule
5.18, where such business requires any license, permit or other authorization of
an Insurance Regulatory Authority of such jurisdiction, where such conduct could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.18.  REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.

         (a)    Except as set forth on Schedule F to the Annual Statements for
the Insurance Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003 as
updated by Schedule F to the June 30, 2004 financial statements, there are no
material liabilities outstanding as of the Closing Date under any Reinsurance
Agreement. (i) Each Reinsurance Agreement is in full force and effect; (ii) none
of the Insurance Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any other
party thereto, is in breach of or default under any such contract; and (iii) the
Borrower has no reason to believe that the financial condition of any other
party to any such contract is impaired such that a default thereunder by such
party could reasonably be anticipated, except to the extent in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately preceding where such failure to be in
full force or effect or such breach or default could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Reinsurance Agreement is qualified under all applicable Requirements of Law to
receive the statutory credit assigned to such Reinsurance Agreement in the
relevant Annual or Quarterly Statement at the time prepared, except where the
failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.18, each Person to whom any of the Insurance Subsidiaries has ceded
any material liability pursuant to any Reinsurance Agreement on the Closing Date
either: (i) has a rating of "A-" or better by A.M. Best or S&P or (ii) has

         (c)    As of the Closing Date, no Insurance Subsidiary has any
reinsured obligations under any Surplus Relief Reinsurance Agreement.

Borrower Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be
clearly and conspicuously marked "PUBLIC" which, at a minimum, shall mean that
the word "PUBLIC" shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by
marking Borrower Materials "PUBLIC," the Borrower shall be deemed to have
authorized the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as either publicly available
information or not material information (although it may be sensitive and
proprietary) with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of
United States Federal and state securities laws; (y) all Borrower Materials
marked "PUBLIC" are permitted to be made available through a portion of the

any action against the Borrower or such Subsidiary, or sets forth circumstances,
if taken or adversely determined, that would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (B) any notice of an actual or threatened
suspension, limitation or revocation of, failure to renew, or imposition of any
restraining order, escrow or impoundment of funds in connection with, any

Material Adverse Effect;

         (h)    the occurrence of any actual change in any insurance statute or
regulation governing the investment or dividend practices of any Insurance
Subsidiary that would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (i)    (i) the occurrence of any material amendment or modification to
any Reinsurance Agreement (whether entered into before or after the Closing
Date), including any such agreements that are in a runoff mode on the Closing

Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) the receipt by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries of any written notice of any denial of coverage, litigation, claim

with GAAP or Statutory Accounting Practices, as the case may be, are being

<PAGE>

appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and adequate reserves in accordance

Borrower or any Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance
of any of its properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of
its business and the Borrower has concluded that such discontinuance could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 6.07.  MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE.  Maintain with financially
sound and reputable insurance companies not Affiliates of the Borrower,
insurance with respect to its properties and business against loss or damage of
the kinds customarily insured against by Persons engaged in the same or similar
business, of such types and in such amounts as are customarily carried under
similar circumstances by such other Persons.

         SECTION 6.08.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.  Comply in all material respects
with the requirements of all Laws and all orders, writs, injunctions and decrees
applicable to it or to its business or property, except in such instances in

undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be

Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic

compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction
of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such
condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender
or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such
Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may


                                       74

<PAGE>

consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

         SECTION 9.05.  DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and
exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or
through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 9.06.  RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation
to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice
of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with
the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in
the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United
States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above;
provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such
resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice
and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the
case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring
Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such
time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C
Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance
of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom
as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or


                                       75

<PAGE>

omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was
acting as Administrative Agent.

         Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer. Upon the
acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a)
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (b) the retiring L/C
Issuer shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer
shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any,
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement
satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of
the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.

         SECTION 9.07.  ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of
their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

         SECTION 9.08.  NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC.  Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, none of the Bookrunners or Arrangers listed on the cover page
hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as
Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder.

         SECTION 9.09.  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.  In case
of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower or
any Letter of Credit Obligor) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention
in such proceeding or otherwise

         (a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all
other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as
may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the
L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and
all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent
under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and


                                       76

<PAGE>

         (b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent
and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of
such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and
counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09
and 10.04.

         Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment
or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.

the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereunder may be delivered or furnished by
electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites)
pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to
Article II if such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, has notified the

Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by
any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder

any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other


                                       79

<PAGE>

or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or

         (a)    Costs and Expenses.  The Borrower (and each Letter of Credit
Obligor, to the extent related to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of
such Letter of Credit Obligor) shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for

Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any
Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the
performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the

with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower

investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the
Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE


                                       80

<PAGE>

NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim
brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach
in bad faith of such Indemnitee's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
Document, if the Borrower or such Loan Party has obtained a final and
nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

         (c)    Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Borrower or
any Letter of Credit Obligor for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount
required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the
Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related
Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related
Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of
the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related
Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of
the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section
2.12(d).

         (d)    Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Borrower and each Letter of Credit Obligor
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee
referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from
the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials
distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information
transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         (e)    Payments.  All amounts due under this Section shall be payable

any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

         SECTION 10.05.  PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.  To the extent that any payment by
or on behalf of the Borrower or any Letter of Credit Obligor is made to the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or
the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently


                                       81

<PAGE>

(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor
Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation
or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such
setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees
to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without
duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such
payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause
(b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.06.    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         (a)  Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this

their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the
extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim

Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that

                (i)    except in the case of an assignment of the entire

otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed);

                (ii)   each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned;

                (iii)  any assignment of a Commitment must be approved by the
Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer unless the Person that is the proposed
assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed assignee would
otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and

                (iv)   the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall

party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d) of this Section.

         (c)    Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower and each Letter of Credit Obligor, shall
maintain at the Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the
Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, each Letter of Credit Obligor, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by each of the Borrower, each Letter of Credit Obligor
and the L/C Issuer at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a consent for a
material or substantive change to the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender
wishing to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request and
receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.

         (d)    Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Borrower, any Letter of Credit Obligor or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural
person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries)
(each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in L/C Obligations)
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
Borrower, each Letter of Credit Obligor, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

         Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower and each Letter of Credit Obligor agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.

         (e)    Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Borrower's and each Letter of Credit Obligor's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower
and each Letter of Credit Obligor is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower and
each Letter of Credit Obligor, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were
a Lender.

         (f)    Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

         (g)    Electronic Execution of Assignments.  The words "execution,"
"signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption
shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in
electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in
any


                                       84

<PAGE>

applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act,
or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act.

         (h)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Letter of Credit Obligor (an "SPC")
the option to provide all or any part of any Revolving Loan that such Granting
Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided
that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any
Revolving Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or
otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Revolving Loan, the Granting
Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving Loan pursuant to the terms
hereof, or if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Administrative
Agent as is required under Section 2.12(b)(ii). Each party hereto hereby agrees
that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option
shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the
obligations of the Borrower or any Letter of Credit Obligor under this Agreement
(including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall be liable for
any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a
Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes,
including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any
provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder. The
making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of
the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Revolving Loan were made
by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, assign all
or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Revolving
Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any
non-public information relating to its funding of Revolving Loans to any rating
agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit
or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

         (i)    Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America
assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank
of America may, upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower, the Letter of Credit
Obligors, and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of any such
resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among
the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure
by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of
Bank of America as L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it
shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto
(including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or
fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).

         SECTION 10.07.  TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates' and to its and its
Affiliates' respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and shall have agreed to keep such Information confidential
substantially in accordance with this Section 10.07), (b) to the extent
requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it
(including any self-regulatory authority, such as the NAIC), (c) to the extent
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal
process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of
any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i)
any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant
in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the prior written consent
of the Borrower and each Letter of Credit Obligor or (h) to the extent such
Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender,
the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower or a Letter of Credit Obligor.

         For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information
received from the Borrower, any Letter of Credit Obligor or any Subsidiary
relating to the Borrower, any Letter of Credit Obligor or any Subsidiary or any
of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower, any Letter of Credit
Obligor or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received
from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is
clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall
be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

         SECTION 10.08.  RIGHT OF SET-OFF.  If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever
currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any
time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower or any Letter of Credit Obligor against
any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Letter of Credit Obligor
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to
such Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the
L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such Letter of Credit
Obligor may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such
Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such
deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The


                                       86

<PAGE>

rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may
have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower or any Letter
of Credit Obligor, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent promptly
after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

         SECTION 10.09.  INTEREST RATE LIMITATION.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be
paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if
it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower or Letter of Credit
Obligor, as the case may be. In determining whether the interest contracted for,
charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum
Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)
characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium
rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof,
and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the
total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations
hereunder.

         SECTION 10.10.  COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS.  This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and
the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.11.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

         SECTION 10.12.  SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a)
the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith


                                       87

<PAGE>

negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with
valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that
of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 10.13.  REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.  If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or if
any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to
replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require
such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section
10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided that:

         (a)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the
assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b);

         (b)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to
the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

         (c)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments thereafter; and

         (d)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

         A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

         SECTION 10.14.  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.

         (a)    GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         (b)    SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER AND EACH OTHER LOAN
PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO
THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN
NEW YORK COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT
OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND


                                       88

<PAGE>

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL
CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL
JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE
ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER
PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL
AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR THE L/C ISSUER MAY
OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER LOAN PARTY OR ITS
PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

         (c)    WAIVER OF VENUE.  THE BORROWER AND EACH OTHER LOAN PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF
VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS
SECTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.

         (d)    SERVICE OF PROCESS.  EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 10.02. NOTHING
IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN
ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

         SECTION 10.15.  WAIVER JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE THAT
SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         SECTION 10.16.  USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE. Each Lender that is subject to
the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and
not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into
law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name
and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or
the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance
with the Act.

                                 EXISTING LIENS


1.            During the second quarter of 2004, Odyssey America pledged Pound
              Sterling 110 million of U.S. treasury notes and placed them on
              deposit at Lloyd's of London on behalf of Advent Capital
              (Holdings) PLC ("Advent"). Advent is 46.8% owned by Fairfax
              Financial , including 15.0% by ORH (7.51% by Odyssey America and
              7.51% by Clearwater). Odyssey America retains the right to
              withdraw the funds at Lloyd's at any time upon 180 days advance
              written notice. The placement of funds at Lloyd's will
              automatically terminate effective December 31, 2008.

                              EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS


Guarantees

1.     Clearwater agreed to allow Ranger Insurance Company ("Ranger"), a
subsidiary of Fairfax, to attach an assumption of liability endorsement to
Ranger's policies issued from July 1, 1999 to April 30, 2004 where required.
Clearwater has terminated the agreement effective April 30, 2004. Clearwater
remains liable for any losses occurring prior to the effective date of the
termination, pursuant to the terms of the endorsements. While Clearwater's
potential exposure in connection with these endorsements is not reasonably
quantifiable at this time, Clearwater deems it to be immaterial, as Fairfax has
agreed to indemnify Clearwater for any obligation under this agreement.
Clearwater anticipates that Ranger will meet all of its obligations in the
normal course of business, and Clearwater does not anticipate making any
payments under this guarantee that would require Clearwater to utilize the
indemnification from Fairfax.

2.     As of July 14, 2000, Odyssey America agreed to guarantee the performance
of all of the insurance and reinsurance contract obligations, whether incurred
before or after the agreement, of Compagnie Transcontinentale de Reassurance
("CTR"), an affiliate, in the event CTR became insolvent and CTR was not
otherwise indemnified under its guarantee agreement with a Fairfax affiliate.
This guarantee was entered into as part of the redeployment of CTR's business to
Odyssey America and was terminated effective December 31, 2001. While Odyssey
America's potential exposure in connection with this guarantee is not reasonably
quantifiable at this time, Odyssey America deems it to be immaterial, as Fairfax
has agreed to indemnify Odyssey America for all obligations under this
guarantee.

3.     Odyssey America agreed, as of April 1, 2002, to guarantee the prompt
payment of all of the insurance contract obligations, whether incurred before or
after the agreement, of Falcon Insurance Company (Hong Kong) Limited, an
affiliate, in the event that Falcon becomes insolvent. Fairfax has agreed to
indemnify Odyssey America for any obligation under this agreement. Odyssey
America anticipates that Falcon will meet all of its obligations in the normal
course of business and does not anticipate making any payments under this
guarantee that will require Odyssey America to utilize the indemnification from
Fairfax.

4.     In January 2004, in conjunction with the purchase by its subsidiary
(O.R.E Holdings) of a 45% interest in Cheran Enterprises Private Limited
("CEPL"), an Indian limited liability company, Odyssey America agreed to provide
a guarantee on behalf of CEPL to facilitate CEPL's establishment of a credit
facility in the amount of US$65 million. The guarantee is conditioned upon a
pledge in favor of Odyssey America by the other shareholders of CEPL of assets
with an aggregate value 1.5 times the amount of the guarantee. CEPL is in the
final stages of arranging the credit facility under which it will


<PAGE>

borrow. In an interim step, US$17 million was loaned in August 2004 by Odyssey
America to a downstream affiliate of CEPL, which amount will be fully repaid
upon receipt by CEPL of the borrowed funds. Under the currently proposed terms,
the lender will have primary recourse against Odyssey America, with a secondary
recourse to Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., under the guarantee. The credit facility
will have an initial term of 18 months with an extension for an additional 12
months. The guarantee is coterminous with the credit facility.

5.     Odyssey Re Holdings Corp. has guaranteed the obligations of Odyssey
America as tenant under the Third Amended and Modified Office Lease Agreement
made as of September 13, 2004 between First Stamford Place L.L.C. and Merrifield
First Stamford L.L.C. and Odyssey America, with respect to Odyssey America's
headquarters at 300 First Stamford Place in Stamford, Connecticut. As of October
1, 2004, the present value of Odyssey America's remaining lease obligation
subject to the guarantee by Odyssey Re Holdings Corp. is $36.801 million,
assuming a 7% discount rate. The lease term ends on September 30, 2022.

6.     Cross-reference is made to the letters of credit listed on Schedule 5.05.

                          TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES


1.     Cross-reference is made to the matters disclosed on Schedules 5.18(b),
       7.01 and 7.03.

2.     Odyssey America owns 97.7% of the shares of First Capital Insurance
       Limited (Singapore). These shares, valued at approximately $35 million,
       are expected to be transferred to Fairfax Asia Limited, a Barbados
       company that is an affiliate ("Fairfax Asia"), in exchange for Fairfax
       Asia shares of equal value. The transaction is expected to be completed
       in 2004.
