          (a) Terms of Loans.  Each Lender has made a Loan in the principal
     amount set forth in Schedule 2.1 under the Existing Credit Agreement. Such
     Loans shall continue to remain outstanding under the terms and conditions
     of this Agreement. Any amount of such Loans repaid may not be reborrowed.

             (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
        Type of Loan shall be at the sole option of the Borrower.

          (b) Loan Accounts.  The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced
     by one or more loan accounts or records maintained by such Lender in the
     ordinary course of business. The loan accounts or records maintained by the
     Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest
     error/rebuttable presumptive evidence of the amount of the Loans made by
     the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any
     failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or
     otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount
     owing with respect to the Loans.

             (ii) Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative
        Agent, the Loans made by such Lender may be evidenced by one or more
        Notes, instead of or in addition to loan accounts. Each such Lender
        shall set forth on the schedules annexed to its Note(s) the date, amount
        and maturity of each Loan made by it and the amount of each payment of
        principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto. Each such Lender is
        irrevocably authorized by the Borrower to endorse its Note(s) and each
        Lender's record shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided,
        however, that the failure of a Lender to make, or an error in making, a
        notation thereon with respect to any Loan shall not limit or otherwise
        affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under any such Note
        to such Lender. Each Note issued to a Lender shall (i) be executed by
        the Borrower, (ii) be payable to the order of such Lender, (iii) be
        dated as of the Closing Date, (iv) be in a stated principal amount equal
        to such Lender's Loans, (v) bear interest in accordance with the
        provisions of Section 2.7, and (vi) be entitled to all of the benefits
        of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and subject to the
        provisions hereof and thereof.

          (c) Conversion and Continuation Elections.  The Borrower may, upon
     irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
     subsection 2.3(b):

          (A) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Loans, or
     as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of
     Offshore Rate Loans, to convert any such Loans (or any part thereof in an
     amount not less than $5,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of
     $1,000,000 in excess thereof) into Loans of any other Type; or

          (B) elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to
     continue any Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any
     part thereof in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or that is in an
     integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof);

     provided, that if at any time the aggregate amount of Offshore Rate Loans
     in respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or
     conversion of part thereof to be less than $5,000,000, Offshore Rate Loans
     shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans, and on and after such
     date the right of the Borrower to continue such Loans as, and convert such
     Loans into, Offshore Rate Loans shall terminate.

             (ii) The Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/
        Continuation to be received by the Administrative Agent not later than
        9:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least (i) three Business Days in advance of

        or continued as

             (iii) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period for Offshore
        Rate Loans, the Borrower has failed to select timely a new Interest
        Period to be applicable to such Offshore Rate Loans, as the case may be,
        or if any Default or Event of Default then exists, the Borrower shall be
        deemed to have elected to convert such Offshore Rate Loans into Base
        Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

             (iv) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of
        its receipt of a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation, or, if no timely
        notice is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent will
        promptly notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion.
        All conversions and continuations shall be made ratably according to the
        respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to
        which the notice was given held by each Lender.

             (v) Unless the Required Lenders otherwise consent, during the
        existence of a Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may not elect
        to have a Loan converted into or continued as an Offshore Rate Loan.

             (vi) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of
        Loans, unless the Administrative Agent shall otherwise consent, there
        may not be more than two different Interest Periods in effect.

          (d) Optional Prepayments.  Subject to Section 3.4, the Borrower may,
     at any time or from time to time, upon not less than three Business Days'
     irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, ratably prepay Loans in
     whole or in part, in minimum amounts of $5,000,000 or any multiple of
     $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Such notice of prepayment shall specify the
     date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid.
     The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of
     any such notice, and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If
     such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such
     prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
     payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to
     each such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to
     Section 3.4.

        of the Net Proceeds of any Disposition other than Dispositions, the Net
        Proceeds of which are less than $10,000,000 in the aggregate, the
        Borrower shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser
        of the amount of the Loans outstanding or the amount of such Net
        Proceeds.

             (ii) If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall issue debt or
        equity, other than debt permitted under Section 7.2, the Borrower or

        estimated Net Proceeds of such issuance to be received by the Borrower
        or such Subsidiary in respect thereof. Promptly upon, and in no event

        prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and,
        during the existence of any Event of Default, interest shall be paid on
        demand of the Administrative Agent at the request or with the consent of
        the Required Lenders.

             (iii) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section, while any
        Event of Default exists or after acceleration, the Borrower shall pay
        interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the
        extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all outstanding
        Loans at a rate per annum which is determined by adding 2% per annum to
        the interest rate then in effect for such Loans; provided, however,
        that, on and after the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to
        any Offshore Rate Loan outstanding on the date of occurrence of such
        Event of Default or acceleration, the principal amount of such Loan
        shall, during the continuation of such Event of Default or after
        acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
        plus 2%.

             (iv) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
        obligations of the Borrower to any Lender hereunder shall be subject to
        the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required for any
        period for which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only
        to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such payment by such
        Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to such
        Lender limiting the highest rate of interest that may be lawfully
        contracted for, charged or received by such Lender, and in such event
        the Borrower shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate
        permitted by applicable law.

          (h) Computation of Interest.  All computations of interest for Base
     Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of America's "prime
     rate" shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
     may be, and actual days (including the first day, but excluding the last
     day) elapsed. All other computations of interest shall be made on the basis
     of a 360-day year and actual days (including the first day, but excluding
     the last day) elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if
     computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest and fees shall accrue
     during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the
     first day thereof to the last day thereof.

             (ii) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
        Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in
        the absence of manifest error.

          (i) Payments by the Borrower.  All payments to be made by the Borrower
     shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as
     otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower shall be
     made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the
     Administrative Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in dollars and in
     immediately available funds, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the
     date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
     each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly
     provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received. Any payment
     received by the Administrative Agent later than

                                        17
<PAGE>

     11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) shall be deemed to have been received on the
     following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
     accrue.

             (ii) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of
        "Interest Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other
        than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the following
        Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included
        in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be.

             (iii) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the
        Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
        that the Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when
        required, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
        such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date in
        immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall
        not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to
        each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such
        Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower has not made such payment in
        full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the
        Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender,
        together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day
        from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date
        repaid.

          (j) Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If, other than as expressly provided
     elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by
     it any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any
     right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other
     share contemplated hereunder), such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the
     Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders
     such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to
     cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment pro rata with each
     of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
     payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender, such purchase
     shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the
     purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount
     equal to such paying Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of
     (i) the amount of such paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total
     amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other
     amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total
     amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
     participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by
     law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off,
     but subject to Section 10.11) with respect to such participation as fully
     as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
     such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall
     be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of
     participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify
     the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.

                                      1.3
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

          (a) Taxes.  Except as otherwise required by law, any and all payments
     by the Borrower to each Lender or the Administrative Agent under this
     Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and
     without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes. In addition, the Borrower
     shall pay all Other Taxes.

             (ii) If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold
        any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder
        to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, then:

                (A) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that,
           after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
           deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable
           under this Section), such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the
           case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
           received and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been
           made;

                (B) the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;
           and
                                        18
<PAGE>

                (C) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
           to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance
           with applicable law.

             (iii) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
        Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of (i) Taxes and
        (ii) Other Taxes in the amount that the respective Lender in good faith
        specifies as paid and necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the
        Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been
        imposed, and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to
        tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
        not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
        Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after
        the date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes written demand
        therefor. Any refund or credit of Taxes or Other Taxes to a Lender or
        the Administrative Agent, including as a result of being incorrectly or
        illegally asserted, shall be remitted by the Lender or the
        Administrative Agent to the Borrower, and the Lender and the
        Administrative Agent agree that they will reasonably cooperate with the
        Borrower to pursue any claim that such Tax or Other Tax was incorrectly
        or illegally asserted.

             (iv) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower
        of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to each Lender or
        the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
        evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment reasonably
        satisfactory to such Lender or the Administrative Agent.

             (v) If the Borrower is required to pay any amount to any Lender or
        the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
        Section, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with
        legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
        Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the
        Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the reasonable
        judgment of such Lender is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to
        such Lender.

             (vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing subsections 3.2(a) through (e),
        the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts to any
        Lender in respect of United States withholding tax pursuant to such
        subsections if (i) the obligation to pay such additional amounts would
        not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender to comply with the
        requirements of Section 9.10 or (ii) such Lender shall not have
        furnished the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with such forms
        listed in Section 9.10 and shall have not taken such other steps as
        reasonably may be available to it under applicable tax laws any and
        applicable tax treaty or convention to obtain an exemption from, or
        reduction (to the lowest applicable rate) of, such United States
        withholding tax.

          (b) Illegality.  If any Lender reasonably determines in good faith
     that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any
     Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any
     Requirement of Law, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other
     Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
     its applicable Lending Office to make Offshore Rate Loans, then, on notice
     thereof by the Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any
     obligation of that Lender to make Offshore Rate Loans shall be suspended
     until the Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that
     the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

             (ii) If a Lender reasonably determines in good faith that it is
        unlawful to maintain any Offshore Rate Loan, the Borrower shall, upon
        its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Lender (with a
        copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay in full such Offshore Rate
        Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued
        thereon and amounts required under Section 3.4, either on the last day
        of the Interest Period thereof, if the Lender may lawfully continue to
        maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the
        Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loan. If
        the Borrower is required to so prepay any Offshore Rate Loan, then
        concurrently with such prepayment, the Borrower shall borrow from the
        affected Lender and the affected Lender shall make available to the
        Borrower, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.
                                        19
<PAGE>

          (c) Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.  If any Lender determines
     that, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any
     change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included
     in the calculation of the Offshore Rate) in or in the interpretation of any
     law or regulation or (ii) the compliance by that Lender with any guideline
     or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether
     or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to
     such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any
     Offshore Rate Loans, then the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from
     time to time, within 15 days of written demand (with a copy of such demand
     to be sent to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent
     for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to
     compensate such Lender for such increased costs.

             (ii) If any Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction
        of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital
        Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or
        administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or
        other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
        administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Lender (or its Lending
        Office) or any corporation controlling the Lender with any Capital
        Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital
        required or expected to be maintained by the Lender or any corporation
        controlling the Lender and (taking into consideration such Lender's or
        such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such
        Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such
        capital is increased as a consequence of its loans, credits or
        obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Lender to
        the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall pay to
        the Lender, from time to time as specified by the Lender, additional
        amounts sufficient to compensate the Lender for such increase.

          (d) Funding Losses.  The Borrower shall reimburse each Lender and hold
     each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which the Lender may sustain
     or incur as a consequence of:

             (i) the failure of the Borrower to make on a timely basis any
        payment of principal of any Offshore Rate Loan;

             (ii) the failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a
        Loan after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice
        of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation;

             (iii) the failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment in
        accordance with any notice delivered under Section 2.5;

             (iv) the prepayment (including pursuant to Section 2.5) or other
        payment (including after acceleration thereof) of an Offshore Rate Loan
        on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

             (v) the automatic conversion under Section 2.3 of any Offshore Rate
        Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the
        relevant Interest Period; including any such loss or expense arising
        from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain
        its Offshore Rate Loans or from fees payable to terminate the deposits
        from which such funds were obtained. For purposes of calculating amounts
        payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section and under
        subsection 3.3(a), each Offshore Rate Loan made by a Lender (and each
        related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be
        conclusively deemed to have been funded at LIBOR in determining the
        Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other
        borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and
        for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan is in
        fact so funded.

          (e) Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Administrative Agent
     determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist
     for determining the Offshore Rate for any requested Interest Period with
     respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan, or that the Offshore Rate
     applicable pursuant to subsection 2.7(a) for any requested Interest Period
     with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan does not adequately and
     fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the
     Administrative Agent
                                        20
<PAGE>

     will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the
     obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans, as the
     case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent
     revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower
     may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation
     then submitted by it. If the Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the
     Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the
     Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the
     Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate
     Loans instead of Offshore Rate Loans, as the case may be.

          (f) Certificates of Lenders.  Any Lender claiming reimbursement or
     compensation under this Article III shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
     copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable
     detail the amount payable to the Lender hereunder and such certificate
     shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest
     error.

          (g) Substitution of Lenders.  Upon the receipt by the Borrower from
     any Lender (an "Affected Lender") of a claim for compensation under Section
     3.3, the Borrower may: (i) request the Affected Lender to use its best
     efforts to obtain a replacement lender or financial institution
     satisfactory to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent (a
     "Replacement Lender") to acquire and assume all or a ratable part of all of
     such Affected Lender's Loans; (ii) request one more of the other Lenders to
     acquire and assume all or part of such Affected Lender's Loans; or (iii)
     designate a Replacement Lender. Any such designation of a Replacement
     Lender under clause (i) or (iii) shall be subject to the prior written
     consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld).

          (h) Survival.  The agreements and obligations of the Borrower in this
     Article III shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

                                      1.4
                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     The effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit
Agreement shall be subject to the receipt of the following documents in form and
substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and in

     Person; and

             (ii) A certificate of the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
        Borrower, and each Subsidiary that may become party to a Loan Document
        certifying the names and true signatures of the officers of the Borrower
        or such Subsidiary authorized to execute, deliver and perform, as
        applicable, this Agreement, and all other Loan Documents to be delivered
        by it hereunder;

          (c) Organization Documents.  The articles or certificate of
     incorporation and the bylaws of the Borrower as in effect on the Closing
     Date, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Borrower or

     additional amounts of Attorney Costs as shall constitute Bank of America's

     be incurred by it through the closing proceedings (provided that such

     the Borrower and Bank of America); including any such costs, fees and
     expenses arising under or referenced in Section 10.4;

          (f) Certificate.  A certificate signed by a Responsible Officer, dated

                                      1.5
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each
Lender that:

          (a) Corporate Existence and Power.  Each of the Borrower and its
     Subsidiaries:

             (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
        standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b)
        has the full corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
        perform the Loan Documents to which it is or will be a party, to own and
        hold its property and to engage in its business as presently conducted,
        and (c) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
        in good standing in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
        or the ownership of its properties requires it to be so qualified except
        where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse
        Effect.

          (b) Corporate Authorization.

             The Borrower has taken all necessary corporate action to execute,
        deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents to which it is or will be
        a party, and has, or on the Closing Date (or any later date of execution
        and delivery) will have, validly executed and delivered each of the Loan
        Documents to which it is or will be a party. This Agreement constitutes,
        and each of the other Loan Documents upon execution and delivery by the
        Borrower will constitute, assuming the due execution of the other
        parties hereto, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower
        enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as Borrower,
        enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
        moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally
        or by general equitable principles.

          (c) No Violation.

             The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this
        Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, and compliance by it
        with the terms hereof and thereof, do not and will not (a) contravene
        any Requirement of Law applicable to the Borrower, (b) conflict with,
        result in a breach of or constitute (with notice, lapse of time or both)
        a default under any material indenture, agreement or other instrument to
        which it is a party, by which it or any of its properties is bound or to
        which it is subject, (c) contravene the terms of the Borrower's
        Organizational Documents or (d) result in or require the creation or
        imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties or assets except to
        the extent provided in the Loan Documents. No Subsidiary is subject to
        any restriction or
                                        22

        encumbrance on its ability to make dividend payments or other
        distributions in respect of its capital stock, to make loans or advances
        to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, or to transfer any of its
        assets or properties to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, in each
        case other than such restrictions or encumbrances existing under or by
        reason of the Loan Documents or applicable Requirements of Law.

          (d) Third Party Consent.

             (i) No consent, approval, authorization or other action by, notice
        to, or registration or filing with, any Governmental Authority or other
        Person is or will be required as a condition to or otherwise in
        connection with the due execution, delivery and performance by the
        Borrower of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
        legality, validity or enforceability hereof or thereof.

             (ii) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has, and is in good
        standing with respect to, all governmental approvals, licenses, permits
        and authorizations necessary to conduct its business as presently
        conducted and to own or lease and operate its properties except where
        the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

             (iii) Schedule 5.4 lists with respect to each Insurance Subsidiary,
        as of the Closing Date, all of the jurisdictions in which such Insurance
        Subsidiary holds licenses (including, without limitation, licenses or
        certificates of authority from relevant Insurance Regulatory
        Authorities), permits or authorizations to transact insurance and
        reinsurance business (collectively, the "Licenses"), and indicates the
        line or lines of insurance in which each such Insurance Subsidiary is
        permitted to be engaged with respect to each License therein listed. To
        the knowledge of the Borrower, (a) no such License is the subject of a
        proceeding for suspension, revocation or limitation or any similar
        proceedings, (b) there is no sustainable basis for such a suspension,
        revocation or limitation, and (c) no such suspension, revocation or
        limitation is threatened by any relevant Insurance Regulatory Authority.
        No Insurance Subsidiary transacts as of the Closing Date any insurance
        business, directly or indirectly, in any jurisdiction other than those
        listed on Schedule 5.4, where such business requires any license, permit
        or other authorization of an Insurance Regulatory Authority of such
        jurisdiction.

          (e) Litigation.

             There are no actions, investigations, suits or proceedings pending
        or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, at law, in equity or
        in arbitration, before any court, other Governmental Authority or other
        Person, (i) against or affecting the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries
        or any of their respective properties that would, if adversely
        determined, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or
        (ii) with respect to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

          (f) Taxes.

             Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
        federal and all material state and local tax returns and reports
        required to be filed by it and has paid all taxes, assessments, fees and
        other charges levied upon it or upon its properties that are shown
        thereon as due and payable, other than those that are being contested in
        good faith and by proper proceedings and for which adequate reserves
        have been established in accordance with GAAP. Such returns accurately
        reflect in all material respects all liability for taxes of the Borrower
        and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby. Except as set
        forth on Schedule 5.6, there is no ongoing audit or examination or, to
        the knowledge of the Borrower, other investigation by any Governmental
        Authority of the tax liability of the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries; and there is no unresolved claim by any Governmental
        Authority concerning the tax liability of the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries for any period for which tax returns have been or were
        required to have been filed, other than claims for which adequate
        reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

          (g) Subsidiaries.

             Schedule 5.7 sets forth a list, as of the Closing Date, of all of
        the Subsidiaries of the Borrower and, as to each such Subsidiary, the
        percentage ownership (direct and indirect) of the Borrower in each class
        of its capital stock and each direct owner thereof.

          (h) Full Disclosure.

             All factual information heretofore or contemporaneously furnished

        the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of or in connection
        with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is, and all
        other such factual information hereafter furnished to the Administrative
        Agent or any Lender in writing by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of
        its Subsidiaries will be, true and accurate in all material respects on
        the date as of which such information is dated or certified (or, if such
        information has been amended or supplemented, on the date as of which
        any such amendment or supplement is dated or certified) and not made
        incomplete by omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the
        statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
        such information was provided, not misleading.

          (i) Margin Regulations.

             Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged
        principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
        extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.
        None of the Loans made to the Borrower will be used, directly or
        indirectly, to purchase or carry any Margin Stock, to extend credit for
        such purpose or for any other purpose that would violate or be
        inconsistent with Regulations T, U or X or any provision of the Exchange
        Act and less than twenty five percent (25%) of the assets subject to
        Section 7.1 and 7.3 consists of Margin Stock.

          (j) No Material Adverse Effect.

             Since March 31, 2001, no event, condition or state of facts has
        existed that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect.

          (k) Financial Matters.

             (i) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Administrative
        Agent copies of the pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower
        and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and the unaudited
        consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries as of
        March 31, 2001 and September 30, 2001 and the related statements of
        income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal periods then
        ended, together with, in the case of the December 31, 2000 statements,
        the opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Such financial statements have
        been prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the financial
        condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
        as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
        operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the respective
        periods then ended. Except as fully reflected in the most recent
        financial statements referred to above and the notes thereto, there are
        no material liabilities or obligations as of the respective date of
        those financial statements with respect to the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, contingent or
        otherwise and whether or not due).

             (ii) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Administrative
        Agent copies of the Annual Statements of each of the Insurance
        Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and for the fiscal
        years then ended and the Quarterly Statement of each of the Insurance
        Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001, each as filed with the relevant
        Insurance Regulatory Authority (collectively, the "Historical Statutory
        Statements"). The Historical Statutory Statements (including, without
        limitation, the provisions made therein for investments and the
        valuation thereof, reserves, policy and contract claims and statutory
        liabilities) have been prepared in accordance with Statutory Accounting
        Practices, were in compliance with applicable Requirements of Law when
        filed and present fairly the financial condition of the respective
        Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby as of the respective
                                        24
<PAGE>

        dates thereof and the results of operations, changes in capital and
        surplus and cash flow of the respective Insurance Subsidiaries covered
        thereby for the respective periods then ended. Except for liabilities
        and obligations disclosed or provided for in the Historical Statutory
        Statements (including, without limitation, reserves, policy and contract
        claims and statutory liabilities), no Insurance Subsidiary had, as of
        the date of its respective Historical Statutory Statements, any material
        liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
        contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) that, in accordance with
        Statutory Accounting Practices, would have been required to have been
        disclosed or provided for in such Historical Statutory Statements. All
        books of account of each Insurance Subsidiary fully and fairly disclose
        all of its material transactions, properties, assets, investments,
        liabilities and obligations, are in its possession and are true, correct
        and complete in all material respects.

             (iii) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, after giving
        effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (i)
        will have capital sufficient to carry on its businesses as conducted and
        as proposed to be conducted, (ii) will have assets with a fair saleable
        value, determined on a going concern basis, (y) not less than the amount
        required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they
        become absolute and matured and (z) greater than the total amount of its
        liabilities (including identified contingent liabilities, valued at the
        amount that can reasonably be expected to become absolute and matured),
        and (iii) will not intend to, and will not believe that it will, incur
        debts or liabilities beyond its ability to pay such debts and
        liabilities as they mature.

          (l) Ownership of Properties.

             Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) has good and
        marketable title to all real property owned by it, (b) holds interests
        as lessee under valid leases in full force and effect with respect to
        all material leased real and personal property used in connection with
        its business, and (c) has good title to all of its other properties and
        assets reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in
        Section 5.11(a) (except as sold or otherwise disposed of since the date
        thereof in the ordinary course of business), in each case under (a), (b)
        and (c) above free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

          (m) ERISA.

        the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code
        with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all material respects
        with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Internal
        Revenue Code with respect to each Plan. No member of the ERISA Group has
        (a) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of
        the Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (b) failed to make any
        contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect
        of any Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment to any Plan or Benefit
        Arrangement, which has resulted or could result in the imposition of a
        Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or the
        Internal Revenue Code or (c) incurred any liability under Title IV of
        ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under Section 4007

             (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.14(a), no Hazardous Materials
        are or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, have been generated, released,
        treated or disposed of by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
        the knowledge of the Borrower, by any other Person or otherwise, in, on
        or under any portion of any real property owned by the Borrower or any
        of its Subsidiaries, except in material compliance with all applicable
        Environmental Laws, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no portion of
        any such real property has been contaminated by any Hazardous Materials.
        For purposes of this Section 5.14, "contaminated" means the presence of
        Hazardous Materials that require or required within five years prior to
        the date of this Agreement, as the case may be, remediation under any
        Environmental Law.

                                        25

             (ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14(b), to the knowledge of
        the Borrower, (i) no portion of any real property owned by the Borrower
        or any of its Subsidiaries has been used as or for a mine, a landfill, a
        dump or other disposal facility, a gasoline service station, or (other
        than for petroleum substances stored in the ordinary course of business)
        a petroleum products storage facility, (ii) no portion of such real
        property or any other real property at any time owned by the Borrower or
        any of its Subsidiaries has, pursuant to any Environmental Law, been
        placed on the "National Priorities List" or "CERCLIS List" (or any
        similar federal, state or local list) of sites subject to possible
        environmental problems, and (iii) there are not and have never been any
        underground storage tanks situated on any real property owned by the
        Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

             (iii) All activities and operations of the Borrower and its
        Subsidiaries are in compliance with the requirements of all applicable
        Environmental Laws, except to the extent the failure so to comply,
        individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have
        a Material Adverse Effect. Other than claims in the ordinary course of
        business pursuant to insurance or reinsurance policies written or
        assumed by an Insurance Subsidiary, neither the Borrower nor any of its
        Subsidiaries is involved in any suit, action or proceeding, or has
        received any notice, complaint or other request for information from any
        Governmental Authority or other Person, with respect to any actual or
        alleged Environmental Claims that, if adversely determined, would be
        reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
        Adverse Effect; and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, there are no
        threatened actions, suits, proceedings or investigations with respect to
        any such Environmental Claims, nor any basis therefor.

          (o) Compliance with Laws.

             Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
        material reports, documents and other materials required to be filed by
        it under all applicable Requirements of Law with any Governmental
        Authority, has retained all material records and documents required to
        be retained by it under all applicable Requirements of Law, and is
        otherwise in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law in
        respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership and operation
        of its properties, except for such Requirements of Law the failure to
        comply with which, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
        reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (p) Regulated Industries.

             Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (i) an
        "investment company," a company "controlled" by an "investment company,"
        or an "investment advisor," within the meaning of the Investment Company
        Act of 1940, as amended, or (ii) a "holding company," a "subsidiary
        company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding
        company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the
        meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

          (q) Insurance.

             The assets, properties and business of the Borrower and its
        Subsidiaries are insured against such hazards and liabilities (other
        than normal life insurance risk), under such coverages and in such
        amounts, as are customarily maintained by prudent companies similarly
        situated and under policies issued by insurers of recognized
        responsibility. No notice of any pending or threatened cancellation or
        material premium increase has been received by the Borrower or any of
        its Subsidiaries with respect to any such insurance policies, and the
        Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with
        all conditions contained therein.

          (r) Certain Contracts.

             Schedule 5.18 lists, as of the Closing Date, each material
        contract, agreement or commitment, written or oral, other than
        Reinsurance Agreements and Insurance Agreements, to which the Borrower
        or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, by which any of them or their
        respective properties is bound or to which any of them is subject (other
        than insurance policies written in the ordinary

                                        26
<PAGE>

        course of business) and that (i) relates to employment or labor matters,
        (ii) involves aggregate consideration payable to or by any party thereto
        of $1,000,000 or more or (iii) is otherwise material to the business,
        condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance or
        properties of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and also
        indicates the parties, subject matter thereof. As of the Closing Date,
        each such contract is in full force and effect, and neither the Borrower
        nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any
        other party thereto, is in breach of or in default under any such
        contract. As of the Closing Date, none of such other parties has
        notified the Borrower that it has any presently exercisable right to
        terminate any such contract nor will any such other party have any right
        to terminate any such contract on account of the execution, delivery and
        performance of the Loan Documents.

          (s) Reinsurance Agreements.

             (i) Except as set forth on Schedule F to the Annual Statements for
        the Insurance Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000
        as updated by Schedule F to the September 30, 2001 financial statements,
        there are no material liabilities outstanding as of the Closing Date
        under any Reinsurance Agreement. Each Reinsurance Agreement is in full
        force and effect; none of the Insurance Subsidiaries or, to the
        knowledge of the Borrower, any other party thereto, is in breach of or
        default under any such contract; and the Borrower has no reason to
        believe that the financial condition of any other party to any such
        contract is impaired such that a default thereunder by such party could
        reasonably be anticipated. Each Reinsurance Agreement is qualified under
        all applicable Requirements of Law to receive the statutory credit
        assigned to such Reinsurance Agreement in the relevant annual Statement
        or Quarterly Statement at the time prepared. Except as set forth on
        Schedule 5.19 each Person to whom any of the Insurance Subsidiaries has
        ceded any material liability pursuant to any Reinsurance Agreement on
        the Closing Date either: (i) has a rating of "A-" or better by A.M. Best
        & Company or S&P or (ii) has provided collateral in favor of the
        applicable Insurance Subsidiary of the type and in an amount described
        in Schedule 5.19.

             (ii) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.19, there are no Reinsurance
        Agreements or Insurance Agreements between the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the Borrower and its
        Subsidiaries.)

             (iii) As of the Closing Date, no Insurance Subsidiary has any
        reinsured obligations under any Surplus Relief Reinsurance Agreement.

                                      1.6

        Subsidiaries to make such dividends, distributions or other payments to

        the Obligations. In the event the approval of any Governmental Authority
        or other Person is required in order for any such Subsidiary to make any
        such dividends, distributions or other payments to the Borrower, or for
        the Borrower to make any such principal or interest payments, the

                (iii) Liens (other than any lien imposed by ERISA, the creation

           to statutory and regulatory requirements of Insurance Regulatory
           Authorities by an Insurance Subsidiary in the ordinary course of its
           business, for the purpose of securing regulatory capital or
           satisfying other financial responsibility requirements;

                (vi) with respect to any real property occupied by the Borrower
           or any of its Subsidiaries, all easements, rights of way, licenses
           and similar encumbrances on title that do not materially impair the
           use of such property for its intended purposes; and

                (vii) Liens (other than Liens specified in clauses (a) through
           (f) above) securing obligations in the aggregate principal amount not

        otherwise acquire any capital stock, evidence of indebtedness or other
        obligation or security or any interest whatsoever in any other Person,
        or make or permit to exist any loans, advances or extensions of credit
        to, or any investment in cash or by delivery of property in, any other
        Person, or purchase or otherwise acquire (whether in one or a series of
        related transactions) any portion of the assets, business or properties
        of another Person, or create or acquire any Subsidiary, or become a
        partner or joint venturer in any partnership or joint venture
        (collectively, "Investments"), or make a commitment or otherwise agree
        to do any of the foregoing, if, immediately after any such Investment,
        the amount of the cash, Cash Equivalents and Investment Grade Securities
        owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
        would be less than eighty percent (80%) of the total Invested Assets of
        the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined as of the end of the most
        recent fiscal quarter; provided that neither the Borrower nor any of its
        Subsidiaries will make or permit any Investment in the Guarantor or any
        of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, other than in the Borrower and its
        Subsidiaries.

        purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value

                                        34
<PAGE>

        any shares of its capital stock or any warrants, rights or options to
        acquire its capital stock, or set aside funds for any of the foregoing,
        except that:

          (A) each Wholly Owned Subsidiary may declare and make dividend
     payments or other distributions to the Borrower or another Wholly Owned
     Subsidiary to the extent permitted under applicable Requirements of Law
     and, as to the Insurance Subsidiaries, by each relevant Insurance
     Regulatory Authority, and

          (B) dividends, payments, distributions, acquisitions, purchases,
     retirements or redemptions not in excess of $12,500,000 in any fiscal year
     may be made; and

          (C) in addition to the amounts permitted under clause (ii), dividends,
     payments, distributions, acquisitions, purchases, retirements or
     redemptions may be made in any fiscal quarter in an amount not greater than
     50% of (A) Consolidated Net Income for such fiscal quarter minus (B)

        indirectly, make any redemption (including pursuant to any change of
        control provision), retirement, defeasance or other acquisition for
        value of any Indebtedness, or make any deposit or otherwise set aside
        funds for any of the foregoing purposes.

          (f) Transactions with Affiliates.

             The Borrower will not, and will not permit or cause any of its
        Subsidiaries to, enter into any transaction with any officer, director,
        stockholder or other Affiliate of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except
        in the ordinary course of its business and upon fair and reasonable
        terms that are no less favorable to it than would obtain in a comparable
        arm's length transaction with a Person other than an Affiliate of the
        Borrower or such Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing contained
        in this Section shall prohibit:

                (i) transactions described on Schedule 7.6 or otherwise
           expressly permitted hereunder; and

                (ii) the payment by the Borrower of reasonable and customary

        could not reasonably be expected to affect the Lenders adversely.

          (h) Lines of Business.

             The Borrower will not, and will not permit or cause any of its
        Subsidiaries to, engage to any substantial degree in any business other
        than the lines of property and casualty insurance or reinsurance
        business and other businesses engaged in by the Borrower and its
        Subsidiaries on the date hereof or a business reasonably related
        thereto.

          (i) Limitations on Certain Restrictions.

             The Borrower will not, and will not permit or cause any of its
        Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or
        suffer to exist or become effective any restriction or encumbrance on
        (a) the ability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to perform and
        comply with their respective obligations under the Loan Documents, (b)
        the ability of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to grant, assume or permit
        to exist any Lien upon any of its assets or properties as

        Subsidiary to make payments or other distributions in respect of its
        capital to the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, or make transfers to
        the Borrower or any other Subsidiary, in each case, other than as
        existing under or by reason of the Loan Documents or applicable
        Requirements of Law.

          (j) Fiscal Year.

             The Borrower will not, and will not permit or cause any of its
        Subsidiaries to, change the ending date of its fiscal year to a date
        other than December 31.

          (k) Accounting Changes.

             The Borrower will not, and will not permit or cause any of its
        Subsidiaries to, make or permit any material change in its accounting
        policies or financial reporting practices, except as may be required by
        GAAP or Statutory Accounting Practices, as applicable, and any change to
        an accounting principle that can be demonstrated by the Borrower to be
        "preferable" in accordance with Statements on Auditing Standards No. 58
        as promulgated by the Auditing Standards Board.

          (l) Reinsurance Agreements.

             The Borrower will not, and will not permit or cause any of its
        Insurance Subsidiaries to be or become a party to any reinsurance
        agreements with any reinsurer not rated "A-" or better by A.M. Best &
        Company or S&P except (a) as listed on Schedule 7.12 (and only in

                                      1.8
                               EVENTS OF DEFAULT

          (a) Event of Default.  Any of the following shall constitute an "Event
     of Default":

             (i) Non-Payment.  The Borrower fails to make, (i) when and as
        required to be made herein, payments of any amount of principal of any
        Loan, or (ii) within three days after the same becomes due, payment of
        any interest, fee or any other amount payable hereunder or under any
        other Loan Document; or

             (ii) Representation or Warranty.  Any representation or warranty by
        the Borrower or the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Borrower made or
        deemed made herein, in any other Loan Document, or which is contained in
        any certificate, document or financial or other statement by the
        Borrower, the Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Borrower, or any
        Responsible Officer, furnished at any time under this Agreement, or in
        or under any other Loan Document is incorrect in any material respect on
        or as of the date made or deemed made; or

             (iii) Specific Defaults.  The Borrower fails to perform or observe
        any term, covenant or agreement contained in any of Sections 6.3,
        6.4(a), 6.11 or in Article VII; or

             (iv) Other Defaults.  The Guarantor, the Borrower or any of the
        Subsidiaries of the Borrower fails to observe, perform or comply with
        any condition, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any
        of the other Loan Documents and such failure shall continue unremedied
        for any grace period specifically applicable thereto or, if no such
        grace period is applicable, for a period after
                                        36
<PAGE>

        the Borrower acquires knowledge thereof of (a) five (5) days with
        respect to covenants set forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 or (b) thirty (30)
        days with respect to any other condition, covenant or agreement; or

             (v) Cross-Default.  The Guarantor, the Borrower or any of the
        Subsidiaries of Borrower shall (a) fail to pay when due (whether by
        scheduled maturity, acceleration or otherwise and after giving effect to
        any applicable grace period) any principal of or interest on any
        Indebtedness (other than the Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this
        Agreement) having an aggregate principal amount of at least $5,000,000;
        or (b) fail to observe, perform or comply with any condition, covenant
        or agreement contained in any agreement or instrument evidencing or
        relating to any such Indebtedness, or any other event shall occur or
        condition exist in respect thereof, and the effect of such failure,
        event or condition is to cause, or permit the holder or holders of such
        Indebtedness (or a trustee or agent on its or their behalf) to cause
        (with the giving of no lapse of time, or both), such Indebtedness to
        become due, or to be prepaid, redeemed, purchased or defeased, prior to
        its stated maturity; or

             (vi) Insolvency; Voluntary Proceeding.  The Guarantor, the Borrower
        or any of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower shall (a) file a voluntary
        petition or commence a voluntary case seeking liquidation, winding-up,
        reorganization, dissolution, arrangement, readjustment of debts or any
        other relief under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other applicable
        bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (b)

        its debts generally as they become due, (e) make a general assignment
        for the benefit of creditors or (f) take any corporate action to
        authorize or approve any of the foregoing; or

        case shall be filed or commenced against the Guarantor, the Borrower or
        any of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower seeking liquidation, winding-up,
        reorganization, dissolution, arrangement, readjustment of debts, the
        appointment of a custodian, trustee, receiver or similar official for it
        or all or a substantial part of its properties or any other relief under
        the Bankruptcy Code or under any other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
        or similar law now or hereafter in effect, and such petition or case
        shall continue undismissed and unstayed for a period of sixty (60) days;
        or an order, judgment or decree approving or ordering any of the
        foregoing shall be entered in any such proceeding and (ii) any Insurance
        Regulatory Authority or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
        shall issue any order of conservation, supervision, rehabilitation or
        liquidation or any other order of similar effect in respect of any
        Insurance Subsidiary, and such action, individually or in the aggregate,
        would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

             (viii) ERISA.  Any member of the ERISA Group shall fail to pay when
        due an amount or amounts aggregating in excess of $5,000,000 which it
        shall have become liable to pay under Title IV of ERISA; or notice of

        member of the ERISA Group, any plan administrator or any combination of
        the foregoing; or the PBGC shall institute proceedings under Title IV of
        ERISA to terminate, to impose liability (other than for premiums under
        Section 4007 of ERISA) in respect of, or to cause a Trustee to be
        appointed to administer any Plan; or a condition shall exist by reason
        of which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree adjudicating that
        any Plan must be terminated; or there shall occur a complete or partial
        withdrawal from, or a default, within the meaning of Section 4219(c)(5)
        of ERISA, with respect to, one or more Multiemployer Plans which could
        cause one or more members of the ERISA Group to incur a current payment
        obligation in excess of $5,000,000; or

             (ix) Monetary Judgments.  Any one or more money judgments, writs or
        warrants of attachment, executions or similar processes involving an
        aggregate amount (exclusive of amounts fully

                                        37
<PAGE>

        bonded or covered by insurance as to which the surety or insurer, as the
        case may be, has acknowledged its liability in writing) in excess of
        $5,000,000 (other than a liability of an Insurance Subsidiary under an
        insurance contract written in the ordinary course of business) shall be
        entered or filed against the Guarantor, the Borrower or any of the
        Subsidiaries of the Borrower or any of their respective properties, and
        the same shall not be dismissed, stayed or discharged for a period of
        thirty (30) days; or

             (x) Non-Monetary Judgments.  Any non-monetary judgment, order or
        decree is entered against the Guarantor, the Borrower or any Subsidiary
        of the Borrower which does or would reasonably be expected to have a
        Material Adverse Effect, and there will be any period of 10 consecutive
        days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by
        reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect; or

             (xi) Change of Control.  There occurs any Change of Control; or

     Loss of Licenses.  Any one or more licenses, permits, accreditations or
authorizations of the Borrower of any of its Subsidiaries shall be suspended,
limited or terminated or shall not be renewed, or any other action shall be
taken, by any Governmental Authority in response to any alleged failure by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to be in compliance with applicable
Requirements of Law, and such action, individually or in the aggregate, would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

          (b) Remedies.  If any Event of Default occurs, the Administrative
     Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required
     Lenders,

             (i) by notice of any Event of Default under this Agreement, declare
        the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all interest
        accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable
        hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and
        payable, except as provided above, without presentment, demand, protest
        or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
        the Borrower provided that no such notice shall be required in respect
        of an Event of Default under subsections (f) or (g) of Section 8.1; and

             (ii) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and
        remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents or
        applicable law; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event
        specified in subsection (f) or (g) of Section 8.1 (in the case of clause
        (i) of subsection (g) upon the expiration of the 60-day period mentioned
        therein), the obligation of each Lender to make Loans shall
        automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of all
        outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall
        automatically become due and payable without further act of the
        Administrative Agent or any Lender.

          (c) Rights Not Exclusive.  The rights provided for in this Agreement
     and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
     other rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity,
     or under any other instrument, document or agreement now existing or
     hereafter arising.

                                      1.9
                                   THE AGENT

     (a) Appointment and Authorization; "Administrative Agent."  Each Lender
hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 9.9) appoints, designates and authorizes
the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions
of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed
to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any

                                        38
<PAGE>

other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term
"administrative agent" in this Agreement with reference to the Administrative
Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such
term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting
parties.

     (b) Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or
attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care.

     (c) Liability of Administrative Agent.  None of the Administrative
Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any
of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer
thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the value of or title to any
Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of
the Borrower or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. No Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under
any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

     (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice
or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so
requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
consent of the Required Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure
to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

          (ii) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
     specified in Article IV, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall
     be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied
     with, each document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent
     to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or
     required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
     satisfactory to the Lender.

     (e) Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees
required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders,
unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender
or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The
Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as may be requested by the Required

                                        39
<PAGE>

Lenders in accordance with Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and
until the Administrative Agent has received any such request, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

     (f) Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that none of the
Administrative Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to
it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Administrative Agent-Related
Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it
has, independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the value of and title to any Collateral, and all
applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend
credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession
of any of the Administrative Agent-Related Persons.

     (g) Indemnification of Administrative Agent.  Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand the Administrative Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the obligation
of the Borrower to do so), pro rata, from and against any and all Indemnified
Liabilities; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment
to the Administrative Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative
Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The
undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations
hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.

     (h) Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity.  Bank of America and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Bank of America were not
the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the
Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of
America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower or its
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Subsidiary) and acknowledge that
the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender"
and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

     (i) Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may, and at
the request of the Required Lenders shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon
30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the Administrative
                                        40
<PAGE>

Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from
among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders. If no
successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting
with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among
the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative
agent hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the
rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor administrative agent and the
retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative
Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and
Sections 10.4 and 10.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the
Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
administrative agent as provided for above.

     (j) Withholding Tax.  Each Lender, and each holder of a participation
interest herein, that is a "foreign corporation, partnership or trust" within
the meaning of the Code shall deliver to Administrative Agent, prior to receipt
of any payment subject to withholding (or after accepting an assignment or
receiving a participation interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of
either Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Person and
entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all payments to be made
to such Person by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or Form W-8ECI or any
successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Person by
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) of the United States Internal Revenue
Service or such other evidence satisfactory to Borrower and Administrative Agent
that no withholding under the federal income tax laws is required with respect
to such Person. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Person shall (a)
promptly submit to Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and
signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted
from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then
be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or
such evidence as is satisfactory to Borrower and Administrative Agent of any
available exemption from, United States withholding taxes in respect of all
payments to be made to such Person by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, and
(b) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary
(including the re-designation of its Lending Office, if any) to avoid any
requirement of applicable laws that Borrower make any deduction or withholding
for taxes from amounts payable to such Person. If such Persons fails to deliver
the above forms or other documentation, then Administrative Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable
withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without
reduction. If any Governmental Authority asserts that Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold any tax or other amount from payments made in respect of
such Person, such Person shall indemnify Administrative Agent therefor,
including all penalties and interest and costs and expenses (including Attorney
Costs) of Administrative Agent. The obligation of Persons under this subsection
shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement
of Administrative Agent.

     (k) Syndication Agent; Documentation Agent.  None of the Lenders identified
on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent
" or "documentation agent" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders so
identified as a "syndication agent " or "documentation agent" shall have or be
deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders so
identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking
action hereunder.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

     (a) Amendments and Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by the Administrative Agent at
the written request of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower and acknowledged
by the Administrative Agent, and then any such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders and the Borrower and
acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, do any of the following:

          (i) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other
     Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
     due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan
     Document;

          (ii) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein
     on any Loan, or (subject to clause (ii) below) any fees or other amounts
     payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

          (iii) release the Guaranty;

          (iv) change the percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
     the Loans which is required for the Lenders or any of them to take any
     action hereunder; or

          (v) amend this Section, or Section 2.10, or any provision herein
     providing for consent or other action by all Lenders.

     (b) Notices.  All notices, requests, consents, approvals, waivers and other
communications shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly
otherwise provides, by facsimile transmission, provided that any matter
transmitted by the Borrower by facsimile (i) shall be immediately confirmed by a
telephone call to the recipient at the number specified on Schedule 10.2, and
(ii) shall be followed promptly by delivery of a hard copy original thereof) and
mailed, faxed or delivered, to the address or facsimile number specified for
notices on Schedule 10.2; or, as directed to the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, to such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written
notice to the other parties, and as directed to any other party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent.

          (ii) All such notices, requests and communications shall, when
     transmitted by overnight delivery, or faxed, be effective when delivered
     for overnight (next-day) delivery, or transmitted in legible form by
     facsimile machine, respectively, or if mailed, upon the third Business Day
     after the date deposited into the U.S. mail, or if delivered, upon
     delivery; except that notices pursuant to Article II or IX to the
     Administrative Agent shall not be effective until actually received by the
     Administrative Agent.

          (iii) Any agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders herein
     to receive certain notices by telephone or facsimile is solely for the
     convenience and at the request of the Borrower. The Administrative Agent
     and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any Person
     purporting to be a Person authorized by the Borrower to give such notice
     and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not have any liability
     to the Borrower or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken
     by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in reliance upon such telephonic
     or facsimile notice. The obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans
     shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by the
     Administrative Agent and the Lenders to receive written confirmation of any
     telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by the Administrative Agent
     and the Lenders of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms
     understood by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to be contained in
     the telephonic or facsimile notice.

     (c) No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure to exercise and no delay in
exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a

                                        42
<PAGE>

waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

     (d) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall:

          (i) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
     consummated, pay or reimburse Bank of America (including in its capacity as
     Administrative Agent) and each Lender within five Business Days after
     presentation of a statement or invoice (subject to subsection 4.7) for all
     reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Bank of America (including in its
     capacity as Administrative Agent) and each Lender in connection with the
     development, preparation, delivery, administration and execution of, and
     any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in each case, whether
     or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and any other
     documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
     reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by Bank of America (including in its
     capacity as Administrative Agent) and any Lender with respect thereto; and

          (ii) pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger and
     each Lender within five Business Days after presentation of a statement or
     invoice (subject to subsection 4.7) for all costs and expenses (including
     reasonable Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection with the
     enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or
     remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document during the
     existence of an Event of Default or after acceleration of the Loans
     (including in connection with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the
     Loans, and including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding);
     and

          (iii) pay or reimburse Bank of America (including in its capacity as
     Administrative Agent) within five Business Days after presentation of a
     statement or invoice (subject to subsection 4.7) for all appraisal
     (including the non-duplicative allocated cost of internal appraisal
     services), audit, environmental inspection and review (including the
     non-duplicative allocated cost of such internal services), search and
     filing costs, fees and expenses, incurred or sustained by Bank of America
     (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) in connection with the
     matters referred to under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section.

     (e) Borrower Indemnification.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Administrative Agent-Related Persons, and each Lender and each of its respective
officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an
"Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
charges, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable Attorney Costs) of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following
repayment of the Loans and the termination, resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or replacement of any Lender) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against any such Person in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such
Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect
to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency
Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified
Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"); provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The
agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations.

          (ii) In no event shall any site visit, observation, or testing by the
     Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any contractee of the Administrative
     Agent or any Lender) be deemed a representation or warranty that Hazardous
     Materials are or are not present in, on, or under, the site, or that there
     has been or shall be compliance with any Environmental Law. Neither the
     Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to rely on any site visit,
     observation, or testing by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. Neither
     the Administrative Agent nor any Lender owes any duty of care to protect
     the Borrower or any
                                        43
<PAGE>

     other Person against, or to inform the Borrower or any other party of, any
     Hazardous Materials or any other adverse condition affecting any site or
     property. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be
     obligated to disclose to the Borrower or any other Person any report or
     findings made as a result of, or in connection with, any site visit,
     observation, or testing by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

          (iii) Survival; Defense.  The obligations in this Section shall
     survive payment of all other Obligations. At the election of any
     Indemnified Person, the Borrower shall defend such Indemnified Person using
     legal counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person in such Person's sole
     discretion, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrower. All amounts owing
     under this Section shall be paid within 30 days after demand in writing
     setting forth in reasonable detail the reason for such demand.

     (f) Judgment Currency.

          (i) All sums due and payable hereunder shall be paid in United States
     Dollars. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is
     necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency,
     the Borrower and the Lenders agree, to the fullest extent permitted bylaw,
     that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with
     normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase United
     States Dollars with such other currency on the business day preceding that
     on which the final judgment is given.

          (ii) The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it
     to the Lenders hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency
     other than Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the business
     day following receipt by the Lenders of any sum adjudged to be so due in
     such other currency the Lenders may in accordance with normal banking
     procedures purchase Dollars with such other currency, if the Dollars so
     purchased are less than the sum originally due to the Lenders in Dollars,
     the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
     judgment, to indemnify the Lenders against such loss, and if the Dollars so
     purchased exceed the sum originally due to the Lenders in the Dollars, the
     Lenders agree to remit to the Borrower such excess.

     (g) Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor
the Lenders shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in favor of the
Borrower or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations. To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
exercise their right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such
set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent
of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its pro rata
share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent.

     (h) Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender.

     (i) Assignments, Participations, etc.  Any Lender may, with the written
consent of the Borrower (at all times other than during the existence of an
Event of Default) and the Administrative Agent, which consent of the Borrower
shall not be unreasonably withheld, at any time assign and delegate to one or
more Eligible Assignees (provided that no written consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall be required in connection with any assignment and
delegation by a Lender to an Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of such
Lender) (each an "Assignee") all, or any ratable part of all, of the Loans and
the other rights and obligations of such Lender hereunder, in a minimum amount
of $10,000,000; provided, however, that the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (A) written notice of such
assignment, together with payment

                                        44
<PAGE>

instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the Assignee,
shall have been given to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such
Lender and the Assignee; (B) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the
form of Exhibit C ("Assignment and Acceptance") and (C) the assignor Lender or
Assignee has paid to the Administrative Agent a processing fee in the amount of
$3,500.

          (ii) From and after the date that the Administrative Agent notifies
     the assignor Lender that it has received (and provided its consent as set
     forth in clause (a) above with respect to) an executed Assignment and
     Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced processing fee, (i) the
     Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
     and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
     Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a
     Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the
     extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
     Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and
     Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
     under the Loan Documents.

          (iii) Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee
     payment under the Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed
     to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect
     the addition of the Assignee.

          (iv) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks
     or other Persons not property and casualty insurance companies or
     Affiliates thereof or Affiliates of the Borrower (a "Participant")
     participating interests in any Loan, and the other interests of that Lender
     (the "originating Lender") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;
     provided, however, that (i) the originating Lender's obligations under this
     Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating Lender shall remain
     solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
     Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
     directly with the originating Lender in connection with the originating
     Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents, and (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating
     interest under which the Participant has rights to approve any amendment
     to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other
     Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would
     require unanimous consent of the Lenders as described in the first proviso
     to Section 10.1. In the case of any such participation, the Participant
     shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.1, 3.3 and 10.5 as though it
     were also a Lender hereunder, and if amounts outstanding under this
     Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have
     become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
     Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
     participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same
     extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly
     to it as a Lender under this Agreement.

          (v) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender
     may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any
     portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any
     Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S.
     Treasury Regulation 31 CFR sec.203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may
     enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under
     applicable law.

          (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
     Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
     (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting
     Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide
     to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would
     otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement;
     provided that no SPC or Granting Lender shall be entitled to receive any
     greater amounts pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.3 or 3.4, than the Granting
     Lender would have been entitled to receive had the Granting Lender not
     otherwise granted such SPC the option to provide any Loan to the Borrower.
     Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any
     indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability
     for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the
     foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement

                                        45
<PAGE>

     shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date
     that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
     commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not
     institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such
     SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
     proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Granting Lender unconditionally agrees
     to indemnify the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender against
     all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
     judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
     whatsoever which may be incurred by or asserted against the Borrower, the
     Administrative Agent, or such Lender, as the case may be, in any way
     relating to or arising as a consequence of any such forbearance or delay in
     the initiation of any such proceeding against its SPC. Each party hereto
     hereby acknowledges and agrees that no SPC shall have the rights of a
     Lender hereunder, such rights being retained by the applicable Granting
     Lender. Accordingly, and without limiting the foregoing, each party hereby
     further acknowledges and agrees that no SPC shall have any voting rights
     hereunder and that the voting rights attributable to any Loan made by an
     SPC shall be exercised only by the relevant Granting Lender and that each
     Granting Lender shall serve as the agent and attorney-in-fact for its SPC
     and shall on behalf of its SPC receive any and all payments made for the
     benefit of such SPC. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
     contained in this Section 10.9(f), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but
     without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative
     Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a
     portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any
     financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative
     Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of
     such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose
     on a confidential basis in accordance with this Agreement any non-public
     information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper
     dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity
     enhancement to such SPC. This section may not be amended without the
     written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Loan is
     being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment.

     (j) Confidentiality.  Each Lender agrees to take and to cause its
Affiliates to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to
maintain the confidentiality of all non-public information by the Borrower and
provided to it by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or by the Administrative Agent
on the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's behalf, under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such
information other than in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents or in connection with other business now or
hereafter existing or contemplated with the Borrower or any Subsidiary; except
to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure by the Lender, or (ii) was or
becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with the Borrower known to the Lender; provided, however, that any Lender may
disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of
any Governmental Authority to which the Lender is subject or in connection with
an examination of such Lender by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be party;
(E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any
remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Lender's
independent auditors and other professional advisors; (G) to any Participant or
Assignee, actual or potential, provided that such Person agrees in writing to
keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Lenders
hereunder; (H) as to any Lender or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under
the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which
the Borrower or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Lender or
such Affiliate; and (I) to its Affiliates.

     (k) Set-off.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the
Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
                                        46
<PAGE>

final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all
Obligations owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of
whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand
under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be
contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set-off and application.

     (l) Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc.  Each Lender shall
notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in the address to
which notices to the Lender should be directed, of addresses of any Lending
Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it
hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably request.

     (m) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate
counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, and
all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute but one
and the same instrument.

     (n) Severability.  The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

          (i) No Third Parties Benefitted.  This Agreement is made and entered
     into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Borrower, the
     Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent-Related
     Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person
     shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or
     indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any
     of the other Loan Documents.

     (o) Governing Law and Jurisdiction.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK;
PROVIDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS
ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

          (ii) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
     ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW
     YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY
     EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE
     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF
     ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF
     THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
     ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON
     THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
     THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF
     THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. THE BORROWER, THE
     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY
     SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS
     PERMITTED BY NEW YORK LAW.

     (p) Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE BORROWER, THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES
AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT
OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE.
THE BORROWER,

                                        47
<PAGE>

THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE
OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR
OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR
ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION
HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS.

     (q) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Borrower,
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their proper and duly authorized officers as of the day and
year first above written.
