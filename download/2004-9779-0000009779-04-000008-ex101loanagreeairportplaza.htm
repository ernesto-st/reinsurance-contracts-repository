          assets, and any consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Flush" FSL="Default" -->
     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Agreements. Borrower is not a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to
          any restriction which might materially and adversely affect Borrower or the
          Property, or Borrower&#146;s business, properties or assets, operations or

          respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,
          covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is
          a party or by which Borrower or the Property are bound. Borrower has no material
          financial obligation under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
          agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by
          which Borrower or the Property is otherwise bound, other than
          (a)&nbsp;obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the operation of the
          Property as permitted pursuant to clause&nbsp;(t)&nbsp;of the definition of
          &#147;Special Purpose Entity&#148; set forth in Section&nbsp;1.1 hereof and
          (b)&nbsp;obligations under the Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Title. Borrower has good, marketable and insurable fee simple title to the real
          property comprising part of the Property and good title to the balance of the
          Property, free and clear of all Liens whatsoever except the Permitted
          Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents
          and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. The Permitted Encumbrances in the
          aggregate do not materially and adversely affect the value, operation or use of
          the Property (as currently used) or Borrower&#146;s ability to repay the Loan.
          The Mortgage, when properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with
          any Uniform Commercial Code financing statements required to be filed in
          connection therewith, will create (a)&nbsp;a valid, perfected first priority
          lien on the Property, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and the Liens
          created by the Loan Documents and (b)&nbsp;perfected security interests in and
          to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the
          Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case subject only to
          any applicable Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted
          pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents.
          Except as noted below, there are no claims for payment for work, labor or
          materials affecting the Property which are or may become a Lien prior to, or of
          equal priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents. DECA Development
          has performed labor and provided services in connection with the buildout of the
          Bed Bath &amp; Beyond leased space at the Property (the &#147;Bed Bath &amp;
          Beyond Work&#148;), not all of which have been paid as of the date hereof.
          Borrower represents and warrants that Borrower (i) has reserved funds with
          Lender pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof for the payment of the Bed Bath &amp;
          Beyond Work, and (ii) will not permit any mechanics or materialmen lien with
          respect to the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Work to be filed against the Property (and
          if any such mechanic or materialmen lien is recorded against the Property, then
          Borrower, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice thereof, shall contest
          such mechanic or materialmen lien in accordance with the terms of Section 5.1.1
          hereof or discharge and/or pay such mechanic or materialmen lien in full).
          Borrower covenants that the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Work will be performed and
          completed in accordance with all Legal Requirements, including, but not limited
          to, all zoning laws. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Flush" FSL="Default" -->
     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Solvency. Borrower has (a)&nbsp;not entered into the transaction or executed the
          Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents with the actual intent to
          hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and (b)&nbsp;received reasonably
          equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under such Loan Documents. The
          fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets exceeds and will, immediately
          following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower&#146;s total liabilities,
          including, without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and
          contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets is and
          will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than
          Borrower&#146;s probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its
          contingent liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured.
          Borrower&#146;s assets do not and, immediately following the making of the Loan
          will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as
          conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to, and does
          not believe that it will, incur debt and liabilities (including contingent
          liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debt and
          liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash
          to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of
          obligations of Borrower). No petition in bankruptcy has been filed against
          Borrower or any constituent Person, and neither Borrower nor any constituent
          Person has ever made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or taken
          advantage of any insolvency act for the benefit of debtors. Neither Borrower nor
          any of its constituent Persons are contemplating either the filing of a petition
          by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency laws or the
          liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower&#146;s assets or properties,
          and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such
          petition against it or such constituent Persons. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Full and Accurate Disclosure. No statement of fact made by Borrower in this
          Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of
          a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements
          contained herein or therein not misleading. There is no material fact presently
          known to Borrower which has not been disclosed to Lender which adversely
          affects, nor as far as Borrower can foresee, might adversely affect, the
          Property or the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
          Borrower. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.1.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          No Plan Assets. Borrower is not an &#147;employee benefit plan,&#148; as defined
          in Section&nbsp;3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title&nbsp;I of ERISA, and none of the
          assets of Borrower constitutes or will constitute &#147;plan assets&#148; of one
          or more such plans within the meaning of 29&nbsp;C.F.R. Section&nbsp;2510.3-101.
          In addition, (a)&nbsp;Borrower is not a &#147;governmental plan&#148; within the
          meaning of Section&nbsp;3(32) of ERISA and (b)&nbsp;transactions by or with
          Borrower are not subject to any state statute regulating investments of, or
          fiduciary obligations with respect to, governmental plans similar to the
          provisions of Section&nbsp;406 of ERISA or Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code
          currently in effect, which prohibit or otherwise restrict the transactions
          contemplated by this Loan Agreement. </FONT></P>

          material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, including, without
          limitation, building and zoning ordinances and codes. Borrower is not in default
          or violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any
          Governmental Authority. There has not been committed by Borrower or any other
          Person in occupancy of or involved with the operation or use of the Property any
          act or omission affording the federal government or any other Governmental
          Authority the right of forfeiture as against the Property or any part thereof or
          any monies paid in performance of Borrower&#146;s obligations under any of the
          Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

          long-term commitments or unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable
          commitments that are known to Borrower and reasonably likely to have a
          materially adverse effect on the Property or the operation thereof as a retail
          property, except as referred to or reflected in said financial statements. Since
          the date of such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change
          in the financial condition, operation or business of Borrower from that set
          forth in said financial statements. </FONT></P>

          judgment of Lender, the validity, applicability or violation of such Legal
          Requirement is finally established or the Property (or any part thereof or

          assigned to any Securities or any class thereof in connection with any
          Securitization, or (D)&nbsp;a completion and performance bond or an irrevocable
          letter of credit (payable on sight draft only) issued by a financial institution
          having a rating by S&amp;P of not less than &#147;A-1+&#148; if the term of such
          bond or letter of credit is no longer than three (3) months or, if such term is
          in excess of three (3) months, issued by a financial institution having a rating
          that is acceptable to Lender and that the applicable Rating Agencies have

          withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then current ratings
          assigned to any Securities or any class thereof in connection with any

          Property (other than such amounts to be paid or reimbursed by tenants under the

requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently
prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and experts,
and cooperate with them in the carrying on or defense of any such proceedings.
Notwithstanding any taking by any public or quasi-public authority through Condemnation or
otherwise (including, but not limited to, any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation

thereof sufficient to pay the Debt. </FONT></P>

Fund. Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a)&nbsp;one-twelfth of the Taxes
that Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve&nbsp;(12) months in
order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes at least
thirty&nbsp;(30) days prior to their respective due dates, and (b)&nbsp;one-twelfth of the
Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable for the renewal of the coverage
afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender
sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty&nbsp;(30) days prior
to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called
the &#147;Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund&#148;). The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and the
Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount, shall be added together and shall be paid as an
aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender. Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund
to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to
Section&nbsp;5.1.2 hereof and under the Mortgage. In making any payment relating to the
Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or
estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or
agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture,
tax lien or title&nbsp;or claim thereof (provided, however, that Lender shall copy
Borrower with all such bills, statements, or estimates on which Lender is relying). If the
amount of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and
Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.1.2 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to
be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower.
In allocating such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender
to be the owner of the Property. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax
and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance
Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such

          severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to
          effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and
          substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and
          irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
          interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
          desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its

          be obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the

          warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such
          representations and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be
          given by Borrower only as of the Closing Date. </FONT></P>

          Remedies Cumulative; Waivers. The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under
          this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power
          or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or
          the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise (subject
          to the limitation of liability set forth in Section 9.4 hereof). Lender&#146;s

          otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in
          Lender&#146;s sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy,
          right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy,
          right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy,
          right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed
          expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower
          shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of
          Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon. </FONT></P>

          it from any liability which it may have under the indemnification provisions of
          this Section&nbsp;9.2 except to the extent that it has been materially

          the Indemnified Person or Persons shall have the right to select separate
          counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the
          defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Person or Persons. The
          Indemnified Person shall instruct its counsel to maintain reasonably detailed
          billing records for fees and disbursements for which such Indemnified Person is
          seeking reimbursement hereunder and shall submit copies of such detailed billing
          records to substantiate that such counsel&#146;s fees and disbursements are
