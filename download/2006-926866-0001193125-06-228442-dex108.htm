waives all rights to require Beneficiary to pursue any other remedy it may have against Borrower, or any partner of Borrower, including any and all benefits under California Civil Code Section&nbsp;2845, 2849 and 2850. Accommodation Grantor further
waives any rights, defenses and benefits that may be derived from Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction and further waive all other suretyship defenses

(ii)&nbsp;accept a transfer of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, (iii)&nbsp;compromise or adjust the Loan or any part of it or make any other accommodation with Borrower, Accommodation Grantor or any Guarantor, or (iv)&nbsp;exercise any
other remedy against Borrower or any security. No such action by Beneficiary shall release or limit the liability of Accommodation Grantor, who shall remain liable under this Deed of Trust after the action, even if the effect of the action is to
deprive Accommodation Grantor of any subrogation rights, rights of indemnity, or other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrower for any sums paid to Beneficiary, whether contractual or arising by operation of law or otherwise. Accommodation
Grantor expressly agrees that under no circumstances shall they be deemed to have any right, title, interest or claim in or to any real or personal property to be held by Beneficiary or any third party after any foreclosure or transfer in lieu of

operation of law (including the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor or similar statute) or otherwise, (B)&nbsp;all rights to enforce any remedy that Beneficiary may have against Borrower, and (C)&nbsp;all rights to participate in any

Civil Procedure or otherwise. Accommodation Grantor further waives any right to a fair value hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure Section&nbsp;580a, or any other similar law, to determine the size of any deficiency owing (for which
Accommodation Grantor would be liable hereunder) following a non-judicial foreclosure sale. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
