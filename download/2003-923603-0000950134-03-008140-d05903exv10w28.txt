      2.2.2 Interest Calculation.

      Interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan shall be

outstanding principal balance.

      2.2.3 Eurodollar Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs.

      (a) (i) In the event that Lender shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest
error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar
market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then
Lender shall forthwith give notice by telephone of such determination, to
Borrower at least one (1) Business Day prior to the last day of the related
Interest Period, with a written confirmation of such determination promptly
thereafter. If such notice is given, the Loan shall bear interest at the
Adjusted Prime Rate beginning on the first day of the next succeeding Interest
Period. (ii) If, pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.2.3(a), the Loan is
bearing interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate and Lender shall determine (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest
error) that the event(s) or circumstance(s) which resulted in such conversion
shall no longer be applicable, Lender shall give notice thereof to Borrower by
telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to Borrower as soon as
reasonably practical, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to
the last day of the then current Interest Period. If such notice is given, the
Loan shall bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate beginning on the first day of
the next succeeding Interest Period. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Borrower have the right to elect to
have the Loan bear interest at either the Eurodollar Rate or the Adjusted Prime
Rate.

      (b) If any requirement of law or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall hereafter make it unlawful for
Lender in good faith to make or maintain the portion of the Loan bearing
interest at the Eurodollar Rate, (I) the obligation of Lender hereunder to make
the Loan bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate shall be canceled forthwith and
(II) the Loan shall automatically bear interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate on
the next succeeding Payment Date or within such earlier period as required by
Applicable Law. Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay Lender (within ten (10)
days of Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate Lender for any reasonable costs incurred by Lender in making any
conversion in accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order
to make or maintain the Loan hereunder. Upon written demand from Borrower,
Lender shall demonstrate in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to
Lender's determination and the calculation substantiating the Adjusted Prime
Rate and any additional costs incurred by Lender in making the conversion.
Lender's written notice of such costs, as certified to Borrower, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

      (c) In the event that any change in any requirement of any Applicable Law
or in the interpretation or application thereof, or compliance in good faith by
Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
hereafter issued from any

      held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
      advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other
      acquisition of funds by, any U.S. office of Lender which is not otherwise
      included in the determination of LIBOR hereunder;

            (ii) shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the Eurodollar
      Rate, hereafter have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender's
      capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below
      that which Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
      compliance (taking into consideration Lender's policies with respect to
      capital adequacy) by any amount deemed by Lender to be material; or

            (iii) shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the Eurodollar
      Rate, hereafter impose on Lender any other condition, the result of which
      is to increase the cost to Lender of making, renewing or maintaining loans
      or extensions of credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder by
      any amount deemed by Lender to be material;

then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay Lender (within ten (10) days
of Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which
Lender deems to be material. If Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.2.3(c), Lender shall provide Borrower with
written notice specifying in reasonable detail the event or circumstance by
reason of which it has become so entitled and the additional amount required to
fully compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount. A
certificate as to any additional costs or amounts payable pursuant to the
foregoing sentence submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. This provision shall survive payment of the Note and the
satisfaction of all other obligations of Borrower under the Note, this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

      (c) Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender and to hold Lender harmless from
any loss or expense which Lender sustains or incurs to the extent it is a
consequence of (I) any default by Borrower in payment of the principal of or
interest on the Loan while bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, including,
without limitation, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees
payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the
Eurodollar Rate, (II) any prepayment (whether voluntary or mandatory) of the
Loan on a day that (A) is not the Payment Date immediately following the last
day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or (B) is the Payment Date
immediately following the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto if
Borrower did not give the prior written notice of such prepayment required
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, such
loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of
funds obtained by it in order to maintain the Eurodollar Rate hereunder and
(III) the conversion (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or
involuntary) of the Applicable Interest Rate from the Eurodollar Rate to the
Adjusted Prime Rate with respect to any portion of the outstanding principal
amount of the Loan then bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate on a date other
than


                                       29
<PAGE>
the Payment Date immediately following the last day of an Interest Period,
including, without limitation, such loss or expenses arising from interest or
fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain
the Eurodollar Rate hereunder (the amounts referred to in clauses (I), (II) and
(III) are herein referred to collectively as the "Breakage Costs"). This
provision shall survive payment of the Note and the satisfaction of all other
obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      2.2.4 Payment on Maturity Date.

      Borrower shall pay to Lender on (or, to the extent permitted herein
before) the Maturity Date the outstanding principal balance, all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Note,
the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, all interest that would accrue on the outstanding principal balance
of the Loan through and including the end of the Interest Period in which the
Maturity Date occurs (even if such Interest Period extends beyond the Maturity
Date).

      2.2.5 Payments after Default.

      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect
of the Loan, shall accrue at the Default Rate, calculated from the date such
payment was due without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein
Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the
default until the actual receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion
thereof that is then due). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, interest
at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall itself accrue interest at
the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the Security Instruments. This
paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date
of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right or remedy
accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default.

      2.2.6 Late Payment Charge.

      If any principal, interest or any other sums due under the Loan Documents
is not paid by Borrower on the date on which it is due, Borrower shall pay to
Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of such
unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law in order to defray
the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent
payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent
payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Security Instruments and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; provided,
however, Borrower shall have the option, not to be exercised more than three (3)
times during the term of the Loan, to not pay the late payment charge
contemplated by this Section 2.2.6 in the event any Monthly Debt Service Payment
Amount is paid within one (1) Business Day after the date the same was due.

      2.2.7 Usury Savings.

      This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that at
no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the principal
balance of the Loan at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the
terms of this Agreement or the other Loan


                                       30
<PAGE>
Documents, Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the
principal balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate,
the Applicable Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous
payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been
payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due
hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use,
forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread
throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the
rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum
Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan
for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

      2.2.8 Foreign Taxes.

      If the Loan is bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, all payments made
by Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for
or on account of, Foreign Taxes, excluding, in the case of Lender, Foreign Taxes
measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is resident or organized, or any
political subdivision thereof and, in the case of Lender, taxes measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of
Lender's lending office or any political subdivision thereof or in which Lender
is resident or engaged in business. If any non-excluded Foreign Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to Lender hereunder, the
amounts so payable to Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield
to Lender (after payment of all non-excluded Foreign Taxes) interest or any such
other amounts payable hereunder at the rate or in the amounts specified
hereunder. Whenever any non-excluded Foreign Tax is payable pursuant to
Applicable Law by Borrower, Borrower shall send to Lender an original official
receipt showing payment of such non-excluded Foreign Tax or other evidence of
payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender
for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by
Lender which may result from any failure by Borrower to pay any such
non-excluded Foreign Tax when due to the appropriate taxing authority or any
failure by Borrower to remit to Lender the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, provided, however, in the event that Lender or any
successor and/or assign of Lender is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof Lender agrees that, prior to the
first date on which any payment is due such entity hereunder, it will deliver to
Borrower (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case may be,
certifying in each case that such entity is entitled to receive payments under
the Note, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, or (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or successor applicable
form, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax. Each entity required to deliver to Borrower a Form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI or Form W-9 pursuant to the preceding sentence further undertakes to
deliver to Borrower two further copies of the said letter and W-8BEN or W-8ECI
or Form W-9, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as
the case may be, on or before the date that any such letter or form expires
(which, in the case of the Form W-8ECI, is the last day of each U.S. taxable
year of the non-U.S. entity) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent letter and form previously delivered
by it to Borrower, and such other extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably be


                                       31
<PAGE>
      requested by Borrower, certifying in the case of a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI
that such entity is entitled to receive payments under the Note without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such entity from duly completing and delivering any such letter or form
with respect to it and such entity advises Borrower that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax, and in the case of a Form W-9, establishing an exemption from United
States backup withholding tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such entity
fails to provide a duly completed Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form
and, under Applicable Law, in order to avoid liability for Foreign Taxes,
Borrower is required to withhold on payments made to such entity that has failed
to provide the applicable form, Borrower shall be entitled to withhold the
appropriate amount of Foreign Taxes. In such event, Borrower shall promptly
provide to such entity evidence of payment of such Foreign Taxes to the
appropriate taxing authority and shall promptly forward to such entity any
official tax receipts or other documentation with respect to the payment of the
Foreign Taxes as may be issued by the taxing authority.

      SECTION 2.3 Prepayments.

      2.3.1 Voluntary Prepayments.

      Except as otherwise provided herein, Borrower shall not have the right to
prepay the Loan in whole or in part prior to the Payment Date occurring in
November, 2003 (the "Lockout Period"). On any Payment Date occurring after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, Borrower may, at its option, prepay the Loan
in whole, but not in part, upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

      (a) Borrower shall provide prior written notice to Lender specifying the
date (the "Prepayment Date") upon which the prepayment is to be made, which
notice shall be delivered to Lender not less than thirty (30) Business Days
prior to such payment;

      (b) Borrower shall pay to Lender, simultaneously with such prepayment, (i)
if such prepayment occurs prior to the Payment Date occurring in May, 2004 (the
"Open Date"), a prepayment premium equal to one percent (1%) of the original
principal amount of the Loan, (ii) all accrued and unpaid interest calculated at
the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of principal being prepaid through
and including the Prepayment Date together with an amount equal to the interest
that would have accrued at the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of
principal being prepaid through the end of the Interest Period in which such
prepayment occurs, notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the
date of prepayment (the "Interest Shortfall"), (iii) Breakage Costs, if any,
without duplication of any sums paid pursuant to the preceding clause (ii); and
(iv) all other sums then due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan
Documents;

      (c) Mezzanine Borrower simultaneously prepays the Mezzanine Loan in
accordance with the provisions of the Mezzanine Loan Agreement; and


                                       32
<PAGE>
      (d) Junior Mezzanine Borrower simultaneously prepays the Junior Mezzanine
Loan in accordance with the provisions of the Junior Mezzanine Loan Agreement.

      This Section 2.3.1 shall not apply to prepayments made in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.5 hereof.

      2.3.2 Mandatory Prepayments.

      On the next occurring Payment Date following the date on which Borrower
actually receives any Net Proceeds, if and to the extent Lender is not obligated
to make such Net Proceeds available to Borrower for the Restoration of an
Individual Property, Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal balance of
the Note in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Proceeds.
Such prepayment shall be applied, first, to interest on the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan that would have accrued at the Applicable Interest
Rate on the amount prepaid through the end of the Interest Period in which such
prepayment occurs, notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the
date of prepayment, and then to all other amounts then due to Lender under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and then to the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan; provided, however, Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay any prepayment premium in connection with such prepayment.

      2.3.3 Prepayments After Default.

      If, following an uncured Event of Default, Borrower tenders payment of all
or any part of the Debt, or if all or any portion of the Debt is recovered by
Lender after such Event of Default such tender or recovery shall be deemed a
voluntary prepayment by Borrower in violation of the prohibition against
prepayment of the Loan prior to the expiration of the Lockout Period and
Borrower shall pay, in addition to the Debt, (i) all accrued and unpaid interest
calculated at the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of principal being
prepaid through and including the Prepayment Date together with an amount equal
to the interest that would have accrued at the Applicable Interest Rate on the
amount of principal being prepaid through the end of the Interest Period in
which such prepayment occurs, notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends
beyond the date of prepayment, (ii) if such prepayment occurs prior to the
expiration of the Open Period, a prepayment consideration equal to five percent
(5%) of the amount being prepaid, (iii) the Interest Shortfall, if applicable,
with respect to the amount prepaid, (iv) Breakage Costs, if any, without
duplication of any sums paid pursuant to the preceding clause (iii); and (v) all
other sums due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents in
connection with a partial or total prepayment.

      2.3.4 Making of Payments.

      Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be made in
funds settled through the New York Clearing House Interbank Payments System or
other funds immediately available to Lender by 12:00 p.m., New York City time,
on or prior to the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such
account as Lender may designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any
payment hereunder or under the Note shall be stated to be due on a


                                       33
<PAGE>
day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the first
Business Day succeeding such scheduled due date.

      2.3.5 Application of Prepayments.

      All prepayments received pursuant to this Section 2.3 and Section 2.5
shall be applied first, to interest on the outstanding principal balance being
prepaid that accrued through and including the Prepayment Date, second, to
interest on the outstanding principal balance being prepaid that would have
accrued through the end of the Interest Period in which the prepayment occurred,
notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the date of prepayment,
and third, to the payments of principal due under the Loan in the inverse order
of maturity.

      SECTION 2.4 Interest Rate Cap Agreement.

      (a) Borrower shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, and shall thereafter
maintain in effect, an Interest Rate Cap Agreement with an Acceptable
Counterparty, which shall be coterminous with the Loan, as the same may be
extended in accordance with the terms hereof, and have a notional amount which
shall not at any time be less than the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
and which shall at all times have a strike rate equal to the Strike Rate. The
Counterparty shall be obligated under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement to make
monthly payments equal to the excess of one (1) month LIBOR over the Strike
Rate, calculated on the notional amount. The notional amount of the Interest
Rate Cap Agreement may be reduced from time to time in amounts equal to any
payment of the principal of the Loan in accordance with the terms hereof.

      (b) Borrower shall collaterally assign to Lender pursuant to an Assignment
of Interest Rate Cap Agreement substantially in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit C, all of its right, title and interest to receive any and all payments
under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (and any related guarantee, if any) and
shall deliver to Lender an executed counterpart of such Interest Rate Cap
Agreement and notify the Counterparty of such collateral assignment (either in
such Interest Rate Cap Agreement or by separate instrument). The Counterparty
shall agree in writing to make all payments it is required to make under the
Interest Rate Cap Agreement directly to the Lockbox Account or if the Lockbox
Account is not then required to be in effect, into such Account as specified by
Lender. At such time as the Loan is repaid in full, all of Lender's right, title
and interest in the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall terminate and Lender shall
promptly execute and deliver at Borrower's sole cost and expense, such documents
as may be required to evidence Lender's release of the Interest Rate Cap
Agreement and to notify the Counterparty of such release.

      (c) Borrower shall comply with all of its obligations under the terms and
provisions of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement. All amounts paid by the
Counterparty under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall be deposited
immediately into the Lockbox Account or if the Lockbox Account is not then
required to be in effect, into such Account as specified by Lender. Borrower
shall take all actions reasonably requested by Lender to enforce Borrower's and
Lender's rights under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement in the event of a default
by the Counterparty and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify any of its
rights thereunder.


                                       34
<PAGE>
      (d) In the event of any downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
rating of the Counterparty below "AA-" (or the equivalent) by the Rating
Agencies, Borrower shall replace the Interest Rate Cap Agreement with a
Replacement Interest Rate Cap Agreement with an Acceptable Counterparty not
later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice from Lender or
Servicer of such downgrade, withdrawal or qualification.

      (e) In the event that Borrower fails to purchase and deliver to Lender the
Interest Rate Cap Agreement or any Replacement Interest Cap Agreement as and
when required hereunder, Lender may purchase such Interest Rate Cap Agreement
and the cost incurred by Lender in purchasing such Interest Rate Cap Agreement
shall be paid by Borrower to Lender with interest thereon at the Default Rate
from the date such cost was incurred by Lender until such cost is paid by
Borrower to Lender.

      (f) In connection with an Interest Rate Cap Agreement, if requested by
Lender in connection with a Securitization, Borrower shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel from
counsel for the Counterparty (upon which Lender and its successors and assigns
may rely) which shall provide, in relevant part, that:

            (1) the Counterparty is duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the
organizational power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its
obligations under, the Interest Rate Cap Agreement;

            (2) the execution and delivery of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement by
the Counterparty, and any other agreement which the Counterparty has executed
and delivered pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations
thereunder have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do
not contravene any provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) or any law, regulation or contractual
restriction binding on or affecting it or its property;

            (3) all consents, authorizations and approvals required for the
execution and delivery by the Counterparty of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement,
and any other agreement which the Counterparty has executed and delivered
pursuant thereto, and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been
obtained and remain in full force and effect, all conditions thereof have been
duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with any
governmental authority or regulatory body is required for such execution,
delivery or performance; and

            (4) the Interest Rate Cap Agreement, and any other agreement which
the Counterparty has executed and delivered pursuant thereto, has been duly
executed and delivered by the Counterparty and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Counterparty, enforceable against the Counterparty in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

      SECTION 2.5 Release of Property.

      2.5.1 Release of Individual Property.

      Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, Borrower may obtain the release of an
Individual Property from the Lien of the Security Instrument thereon (and
related Loan Documents) and the release of Borrower's obligations under the Loan
Documents with respect to such Individual Property (other than those expressly
stated to survive), but only upon the satisfaction of each of the following

granted such release to Junior Mezzanine Borrower;

      (c) Lender shall have received a wire transfer of immediately available
federal funds in an amount equal to the Release Price for the applicable
Individual Property, together with (i) all accrued and unpaid interest
calculated at the Applicable Interest Rate on the amount of principal being
prepaid through and including the Prepayment Date, (ii) if such release occurs

      (d) Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than ten (10) days prior to
the date of such release, a release of Lien (and related Loan Documents) for
such Individual Property for execution by Lender. Such release shall be in a
form appropriate in each State in which the Individual Property is located and
shall contain standard provisions, if any, protecting the rights of Lender. In
addition, Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably
requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release, together
with an Officer's Certificate certifying that (i) such documentation is in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii) the release will not
impair or otherwise adversely affect the Liens, security interests and other
rights of Lender under the Loan Documents not being released (or as to the
parties to the Loan Documents and Properties subject to the Loan Documents not
being released);


                                       36
<PAGE>
      (e) After giving effect to such release, Lender shall have determined that
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Properties then remaining subject to the
Lien of a Security Instrument (not including the Individual Property to be
released) (but for the purpose of this calculation only, assuming a Release
Price equal to the Allocated Loan Amount) shall be at least equal to the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for all of the Properties (including the Individual
Property to be released) for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the release of the Individual Property;

      (f) Lender shall have received evidence that the Individual Property to be
released shall be conveyed to a Person other than Borrower or Principal;

      (g) In the event the Release Property is subject to an Operating Lease
along with one or more additional Properties, Lender shall have received a
certified copy of an amendment to the Operating Lease reflecting the deletion of
the Individual Property to be released; and

      (h) Lender shall have received payment of all Lender's reasonable costs
and expenses, including due diligence review costs and reasonable counsel fees
and disbursements incurred in connection with the release of the Individual
Property from the lien of the related Security Instrument and the review and
approval of the documents and information required to be delivered in connection
therewith.

      2.5.2 Release on Payment in Full.

      Lender shall, upon the written request and at the expense of Borrower,
upon payment in full of all principal and interest due on the Loan and all other
amounts due and payable under the Loan Documents in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Note and this Agreement, release the Lien of the Security
Instrument on each Individual Property not theretofore released.

      SECTION 2.6 Substitution of Properties.

      Subject to the terms of this Section 2.6 after the expiration of the
Lockout Period, Borrower may obtain a release of the Lien of a Security
Instrument (and the related Loan Documents) encumbering an Individual Property
(a "Release Property") by substituting therefor another hotel property of like
kind and quality acquired by Borrower (individually, a "Substitute Property" and
collectively, the "Substitute Properties"), provided that the following
conditions precedent are satisfied:

      (a) Borrower shall not have the right to release and substitute (i) more
than one (1) Individual Property in accordance with this Section in any twelve
(12) month period and (ii) any Properties after such time as Borrower has
released and substituted Properties which in the aggregate had an appraised
value of more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the aggregate appraised values
of the Properties subject to the Lien of the Security Instruments as of the
Closing Date.

      (b) Lender shall have received at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice requesting the substitution and identifying the Substitute Property and
Release Property.


                                       37
<PAGE>
      (c) If the Borrower continues to own an Individual Property subject to the
Lien of a Security Instrument, Lender shall have received (i) a copy of a deed
conveying all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Release
Property to a Person other than Borrower or Principal pursuant to an arms length
transaction and (ii) a letter from Borrower countersigned by a title insurance
company acknowledging receipt of such deed and agreeing to record such deed in
the real estate records for the county in which the Release Property is located.

      (d) Lender shall have received a current Appraisal of (i) the Substitute
Property and (ii) the Release Property, each prepared within sixty (60) days
prior to the release and substitution, showing an appraised value of the
Substitute Property equal to or greater than one hundred percent (100%) of (A)
the appraised value of the Release Property as of the Closing Date and (B) the
appraised value of the Release Property immediately prior to the date of the
proposed substitution.

      (e) Intentionally Omitted.

      (f) Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower certifying,
together with other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage loan lender that, the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the substitution with respect to the
Substitute Property is equal to or greater than the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the date of the
proposed substitution with respect to the Release Property, which Debt Service
Coverage Ratio shall be based upon the Allocated Loan Amounts of the Substitute
Property and the Release Property.

      (g) If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have received
confirmation in writing from the Rating Agencies to the effect that such release
and substitution will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of
the respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such release and
substitution for the Securities issued in connection with the Securitization
that are then outstanding. If the Loan is not part of a Securitization, Lender
shall have consented in writing to such release and substitution, which consent
shall be given in Lender's reasonable discretion applying the requirements of a
prudent institutional mortgage loan lender with respect to real estate
collateral of similar size, scope and value of the Substitute Property.

      (h) Unless such event or condition relates solely to the Release Property
and will be fully cured by the release and substitution, no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing and Borrower shall be in compliance in all
material respects with all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in each other Loan Document on Borrower's part to be observed or performed.
Lender shall have received a certificate from Borrower confirming the foregoing,
stating that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as
of the date of the release and substitution with respect to Borrower, the
Properties and the Substitute Property and containing any other representations
and warranties with respect to Borrower, the Properties, the Substitute Property

adversely affect the condition (financial or otherwise) or business of Borrower,
Operating Lessee or the condition or ownership of any Individual Property.

      4.1.5 Agreements.

      Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee is a party to any agreement or

fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any
agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which Borrower, Operating
Lessee or any of the Properties are bound. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee
has material financial obligation under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,

as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Neither Borrower nor Operating
Lessee intends to incur debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities
and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debt and liabilities as

permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any
instrument to which Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default
thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with all

enforcement of the contested Legal Requirement against Borrower or any
Individual Property; and (vi) Borrower shall furnish such security as may be
required in the proceeding, or as may be reasonably requested by Lender, to

penalties payable in connection therewith. Lender may apply any such security or
part thereof, as necessary to cause compliance with such Legal Requirement at
any time when, in the judgment of Lender, the validity, applicability or
violation of such Legal Requirement is finally established or any Individual
Property (or any part thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of being
sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost.

Major Leases upon the part of the tenant thereunder to be observed or performed
(except for termination of a Major Lease which shall require Lender's prior
written approval); (iv) shall not collect any of the Rents more than one (1)
month in advance (except Security Deposits shall not be deemed Rents collected
in advance); (v) shall not execute any other assignment of the lessor's interest
in any of the Leases or the Rents; and (vi) shall not consent to any assignment
of or subletting under any Major Leases not in accordance with their terms,
without the prior written consent of Lender.

      (c) Borrower may (and may allow Operating Lessee to), without the consent
of Lender, amend, modify or waive the provisions of any Lease or terminate,
reduce rents under, accept a surrender of space under, or shorten the term of,
any Lease (including any guaranty, letter of credit or other credit support with
respect thereto) provided that such Lease is not a Major Lease and that such
action (taking into account, in the case of a termination, reduction in rent,
surrender of space or shortening of term, the planned alternative use of the
affected space) does not have a material adverse effect on the value of the
applicable Individual Property taken as a whole, and provided that such Lease,
as amended, modified or waived, is otherwise in compliance with the requirements
of this Agreement and any lease subordination agreement binding upon Lender with
respect to such Lease. A termination of a Lease (other than a Major Lease) with
a tenant who is in default beyond applicable notice and grace periods shall not
be considered an action which has a material adverse effect on the value of the
applicable Individual Property taken as a whole. Any amendment, modification,
waiver,


                                       78
<PAGE>
termination, rent reduction, space surrender or term shortening which does not
satisfy the requirements set forth in this Subsection shall be subject to the
prior written approval of Lender and its counsel, at Borrower's expense. At
Lender's request, Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender copies of all
Leases, amendments, modifications and waivers which are entered into pursuant to
this Section 5.1.17(c) together with Borrower's certification that it has
satisfied all of the conditions of this Section 5.1.17(c).

      (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with
respect to any Individual Property, Borrower shall not (and shall not allow
Operating Lessee to), without the prior written consent of Lender, enter into,
materially amend, materially modify, waive any material provisions of,
terminate, reduce rents under, accept a surrender of space under, or shorten the
term of, or renew or extend upon terms and conditions less favorable to
Operating Lessee, any Major Lease or any instrument guaranteeing or providing
credit support for any Major Lease.

      (e) To the extent actually received by Lender, Lender shall hold any and
all monies representing security deposits under the Leases (the "Security
Deposits") received by Lender, in accordance with the terms of the respective
Lease, and shall only release the Security Deposits in order to return a
tenant's Security Deposit to such tenant if such tenant is entitled to the
return of the Security Deposit under the terms of the Lease.

      5.1.18 Management Agreement.

      (a) The Improvements on the Properties are operated under the terms and
conditions of the Management Agreement. In no event shall the base management
fees under the Management Agreement exceed (I) with respect to the Properties
managed by Six Continents Hotels, the sum of (x) five percent (5%) of total room
revenue and (y) two percent (2%) of total revenue; provided, however, Six
Continents Hotels shall not charge any additional franchise fees in connection
with such Properties and (II) with respect to the Properties managed by any
Person other than Six Continents Hotels, four percent (4%) of the gross income
derived from the Property (excluding any incentive management fees which are
subordinate to the Loan). Borrower shall (or shall cause Operating Lessee to)
(i) diligently perform and observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of
the Management Agreement, on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed and
observed to the end that all things shall be done which are necessary to keep
unimpaired the rights of Operating Lessee under the Management Agreement and
(ii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of any notice by Manager to Operating
Lessee of any default by Operating Lessee in the performance or observance of
any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the Management Agreement on the
part of Operating Lessee to be performed and observed and deliver to Lender a
true copy of each such notice. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall
surrender the Management Agreement, consent to the assignment by the Manager of
its interest under the Management Agreement, or terminate or cancel the
Management Agreement, or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the
Management Agreement, in any material respect, either orally or in writing.
Borrower hereby assigns (and Borrower shall cause Operating Lessee to assign) to
Lender as further security for the payment of the Debt and for the performance
and observance of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement, all the
rights, privileges and prerogatives of Borrower and/or Operating Lessee to
surrender the Management Agreement, or to terminate, cancel, modify, change,
supplement, alter or amend the


                                       79
<PAGE>
Management Agreement, in any material respect, and any such surrender of the
Management Agreement, or termination, cancellation, modification, change,
supplement, alteration or amendment of the Management Agreement in any material
respect, without the prior consent of Lender, shall be void and of no force and
effect. If Operating Lessee shall default in the performance or observance of
any material term, covenant or condition of the Management Agreement on the part
of Operating Lessee to be performed or observed, then, without limiting the
generality of the other provisions of this Agreement, and without waiving or
releasing Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder, Lender shall have the
right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any act
or take any action as may be appropriate to cause all the terms, covenants and
conditions of the Management Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be
performed or observed to be promptly performed or observed on behalf of
Operating Lessee to the end that the rights of Operating Lessee in, to and under
the Management Agreement shall be kept unimpaired and free from default. Lender
and any Person designated by Lender by written notice to Borrower shall have,
and are hereby granted, the right to enter upon the applicable Individual
Property at any time and from time to time for the purpose of taking any such
action. If the Manager shall deliver to Lender a copy of any notice sent to
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee of default under the Management Agreement, such
notice shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by Lender in good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower and
Operating Lessee shall not, and shall not permit the Manager to, sub-contract
all or any material portion of its management responsibilities under the
Management Agreement to a third-party without the prior written consent of
Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Borrower shall, from
time to time, cause Operating Lessee to request of Manager and deliver to Lender
upon receipt such certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance by
Operating Lessee with the terms of the Management Agreement as may be reasonably
requested by Lender. Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall exercise each
individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of the Management
Agreement to the extent required to continue it in full force and effect until
after the Maturity Date, and Borrower hereby authorizes and appoints (and shall
cause Operating Lessee to authorize and appoint) Lender their attorney-in-fact
to exercise any such option in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower and/or
Operating Lessee, which power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall be
deemed to be coupled with an interest. Any sums expended by Lender pursuant to
this paragraph (i) shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such
cost is incurred to the date of payment to Lender, (ii) shall be deemed to
constitute a portion of the Debt, (iii) shall be secured by the lien of the
Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents and (iv) shall be immediately
due and payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

      (a) Without limitation of the foregoing, Borrower shall cause Operating
Lessee, upon the request of Lender and in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable Assignment of Management Agreement, to terminate the Management
Agreement and replace the Manager, without penalty or fee, if at any time during
the Loan: (a) the Manager shall become insolvent or a debtor in any bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding, (b) there exists an Event of Default or (c) there
exists an event of default by Manager under the Management Agreement. At such
time as the Manager may be removed, provided no Event of Default has occurred, a
Qualified Manager may be selected by Borrower and/or Operating Lessee to assume
management of the applicable Individual Property pursuant to a Replacement
Management Agreement.

      (a) Borrower covenants and agrees that so long as the Loan is outstanding
(i) all uses and operations on or of the Properties, whether by Borrower or any
other Person, shall be in compliance in all material respects with all
Environmental Laws and permits issued pursuant thereto; (ii) there shall be no
Releases of Hazardous Materials in, on, under or from any of the Properties;

encumbrances imposed pursuant to any Environmental Law, whether due to any act
or omission of Borrower or any other Person (the "Environmental Liens"); (v)
Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully and expeditiously cooperate
in all activities pursuant to paragraph (b) below, including but not limited to
providing all relevant information and making knowledgeable persons available
for interviews; (vi) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, perform any
environmental site assessment or other investigation of environmental conditions
in connection with any of the Properties, pursuant to any reasonable written
request of Lender, upon Lender's reasonable belief that an Individual Property
is not in full compliance with all Environmental Laws, and share with Lender the
reports and other results thereof, and Lender and other Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to rely on such reports and other results thereof; (vii)
Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply with all reasonable written
requests of Lender to (A) reasonably effectuate remediation of any Hazardous
Materials in, on, under or from any Individual Property; and (B) comply with any
Environmental Law; (viii) Borrower shall not allow any tenant or other user of
any of the Properties to violate any Environmental Law; and (ix) Borrower shall
immediately notify Lender in writing after it has become aware of (A) any
presence or Release or threatened Releases of Hazardous Materials in, on, under,
from or migrating towards any of the Properties; (B) any non-compliance with any
Environmental Laws related in any way to any of the Properties; (C) any actual
or potential Environmental Lien; (D) any required or proposed remediation of
environmental conditions relating to any of the Properties; and (E) any written
or oral notice or other communication of which Borrower becomes aware from any
source whatsoever (including but not limited to a Governmental Authority)
relating in any way to Hazardous Materials in connection with the Properties.

      (a) Lender and any other Person designated by Lender by written notice to
Borrower, including but not limited to any representative of a Governmental
Authority, and any environmental consultant, and any receiver appointed by any
court of competent jurisdiction, shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to enter upon any Individual Property at all reasonable times to assess any and
all aspects of the environmental condition of any Individual Property and its
use, including but not limited to conducting any environmental assessment or
audit (the scope of which shall be determined in Lender's sole and absolute
discretion) and taking samples of soil, groundwater or other water, air, or
building materials, and conducting other invasive testing. Borrower shall
cooperate with and provide access to Lender and any such Person or entity
designated by Lender by written notice to Borrower.

      5.1.20 Alterations.

      Borrower shall obtain Lender's prior written consent to any structural or
other material alterations to any Improvements, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld except with respect to alterations that may have a
material adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition, the value of the
related Individual Property or the Net Operating Income thereof.

      5.1.21 Franchise Agreement.

      (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1.21(b), the Improvements on
the Properties shall be operated under the terms and conditions of the Franchise
Agreements, if applicable. Borrower shall (or shall cause Operating Lessee to)
(i) pay all sums required to be paid by Operating Lessee under the Franchise
Agreement, (ii) diligently perform, observe and enforce all of the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating
Lessee to be performed, observed and enforced to the end that all things shall
be done which are necessary to keep unimpaired the rights of Borrower and/or
Operating Lessee under the Franchise Agreement, (iii) promptly notify Lender of
the giving of any notice to Operating Lessee of any default by Operating Lessee
in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
the Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed and
observed and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such notice, and (iv)
promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial statement, business plan,
capital expenditure plan, notice, report and estimate received by it under the
Franchise Agreement. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1.21(b), Borrower
shall not (and shall cause Operating Lessee to not), without the prior consent
of Lender, surrender the Franchise Agreement or terminate or cancel the
Franchise Agreement or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the Franchise
Agreement, in any material respect, either orally or in writing, and Borrower
hereby assigns (and Borrower shall cause Operating Lessee to assign) to Lender
as further security for the payment of the Debt and for the performance and
observance of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement, all the
rights, privileges and prerogatives of Borrower and Operating Lessee to
surrender the Franchise Agreement or to terminate, cancel, modify, change,
supplement, alter or amend the Franchise Agreement in any material respect, and
any such surrender of the Franchise Agreement or termination, cancellation,
modification, change, supplement, alteration or amendment of the Franchise
Agreement in any material respect without the prior consent of Lender shall be
void and of no force and effect. If Operating Lessee shall default in the
performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed or observed,
then, without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Agreement,
and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder,
Lender shall have the right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums
and to perform any act or take any action as may be appropriate to cause all the
terms, covenants and conditions of the Franchise Agreement on the part of
Operating Lessee to be performed or observed to be promptly performed or
observed on behalf of Operating Lessee, to the end that the rights of Operating
Lessee in, to and under the Franchise Agreement shall be kept unimpaired and
free from default. Lender and any Person designated by Lender by written notice
to Borrower shall have, and are hereby granted, the right to enter upon the
Properties at any time and from time to time for the purpose of taking any such
action. If Franchisor shall deliver to Lender a copy of any notice sent to
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee of default


                                       82
<PAGE>
under the Franchise Agreement, such notice shall constitute full protection to
Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Lender in good faith, in
reliance thereon. Borrower shall, from time to time, use its best efforts to
obtain from Franchisor such certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance
by Operating Lessee with the terms of the Franchise Agreement as may be
requested by Lender. Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall exercise each
individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of the Franchise
Agreement to the extent required to continue it in full force and effect until
after the Maturity Date, and Borrower hereby expressly authorizes and appoints
(and Borrower shall cause Operating Lessee to authorize and appoint) Lender as
its attorney-in-fact to exercise any such option in the name of and upon behalf
of Borrower and/or Operating Lessee, which power of attorney shall be
irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest. Any sums
expended by Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall bear interest at the Default
Rate from the date such cost is incurred to the date of payment to Lender, shall
be deemed to constitute a portion of the Debt, shall be secured by the lien of
the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents and shall be immediately
due and payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

      (b) With respect to the Expiring Franchise Agreement Property only,
Borrower shall not be required to obtain Lender's consent or a confirmation from
the Rating Agencies in the event that the Franchise Agreement in effect on the
date hereof is extended on the same or more favorable terms to Borrower and/or
Operating Lessee, as applicable, prior to the expiration thereof.

      5.1.22 Operating Lease.

      Borrower shall:

            (i) promptly perform and/or observe all of the covenants and
agreements required to be performed and observed by it under the Operating Lease

thereunder;

            (ii) promptly notify Lender of any event of default under the
Operating Lease;

            (iii) promptly enforce the performance and observance of all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed and/or observed by the
Operating Lessee under the Operating Lease.

      5.1.23 OFAC.

      At all times throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower, Guarantor,
Indemnitor and their respective Affiliates shall be in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable orders, rules, regulations and

of the Treasury.

      5.1.24 The Ground Lease.

      (a) With respect to each Ground Lease, Borrower shall (i) pay all rents,
additional rents and other sums required to be paid by Borrower, as tenant under
and pursuant to the provisions of each Ground Lease, (ii) diligently perform and
observe all of the terms, covenants


                                       83
<PAGE>
and conditions of each Ground Lease on the part of Borrower, as tenant
thereunder, (iii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of any notice by the
landlord under the applicable Ground Lease to Borrower of any default by
Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such
notice within five (5) days of receipt and (iv) promptly notify Lender of any
bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency of the landlord under the applicable
Ground Lease or of any notice thereof, and deliver to Lender a true copy of such
notice within five (5) days of Borrower's receipt. Borrower shall not, without
the prior consent of Lender, surrender the leasehold estate created by the
applicable Ground Lease or terminate or cancel any Ground Lease or modify,
change, supplement, alter, amend or waive any material term of any Ground Lease,
either orally or in writing, and if Borrower shall default in the performance or
observance of any term, covenant or condition of any Ground Lease on the part of
Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and shall fail to cure the same prior to the
expiration of any applicable cure period provided thereunder, Lender shall have
the right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any
act or take any action as may be appropriate to cause all of the terms,
covenants and conditions of such Ground Lease on the part of Borrower to be
performed or observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the rights of
Borrower in, to and under such Ground Lease shall be kept unimpaired and free
from default. If the landlord under the applicable Ground Lease shall deliver to
Lender a copy of any notice of default under such Ground Lease, such notice
shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by Lender, in good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower shall exercise
each individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of each Ground Lease
upon demand by Lender made at any time within one (1) year prior to the last day
upon which any such option may be exercised, and Borrower hereby expressly
authorizes and appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact to exercise any such option
in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower, which power of attorney shall be
irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest.

      (b) Subleases. Notwithstanding anything contained in any Ground Lease to
the contrary, Borrower shall not further sublet any portion of the related
Individual Property (other than as permitted pursuant to Section 5.1.17 hereof)
without prior written consent of Lender. Each sublease hereafter made shall
provide that, (a) in the event of the termination of the Ground Lease, the
sublease shall not terminate or be terminable by the lessee thereunder; (b) in
the event of any action for the foreclosure of the Security Instrument with
respect to the related Individual Property, the sublease shall not terminate or
be terminable by the lessee thereunder by reason of the termination of the
Ground Lease unless such lessee is specifically named and joined in any such
action and unless a judgment is obtained therein against such lessee; and (c) in
the event that the Ground Lease is terminated as aforesaid, the lessee under the
sublease shall attorn to the lessor under the Ground Lease or to the purchaser
at the sale of the related Individual Property on such foreclosure, as the case
may be. In the event that any portion of such Individual Property shall be
sublet pursuant to the terms of this subsection, such sublease shall be deemed
to be included in the Individual Property.

      (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein with respect
to any Ground Lease:

            (i) The Lien of the Security Instruments attach to all of Borrower's
      rights and remedies at any time arising under or pursuant to subsection
      365(h) of the Bankruptcy


                                       84
<PAGE>
      Code, including, without limitation, all of Borrower's rights, as debtor,
      to remain in possession of the related Individual Property which is
      subject to a Ground Lease;

            (ii) Borrower shall not, without Lender's written consent, elect to
      treat a Ground Lease as terminated under subsection 365(h)(1) of the
      Bankruptcy Code. Any such election made without Lender's prior written
      consent shall be void;

            (iii) As security for the Debt, Borrower unconditionally assigns,
      transfers and sets over to Lender all of Borrower's claims and rights to
      the payment of damages arising from any rejection by any Ground Lessor
      under the Bankruptcy Code. Lender and Borrower shall proceed jointly or in
      the name of Borrower in respect of any claim, suit, action or proceeding
      relating to the rejection of a Ground Lease, including, without
      limitation, the right to file and prosecute any proofs of claim,
      complaints, motions, applications, notices and other documents in any case
      in respect a Ground Lessor under the Bankruptcy Code. This assignment
      constitutes a present, irrevocable and unconditional assignment of the
      foregoing claims, rights and remedies, and shall continue in effect until
      all of the Debt shall have been satisfied and discharged in full. Any
      amounts received by Lender or Borrower as damages arising out of the
      rejection of a Ground Lease as aforesaid shall be applied to all costs and
      expenses of Lender (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
      fees and costs) incurred in connection with the exercise of any of its
      rights or remedies in accordance with the applicable provisions hereof;

            (iv) If pursuant to subsection 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code,
      Borrower seeks to offset, against the rent reserved in a Ground Lease, the
      amount of any damages caused by the nonperformance by the applicable
      Ground Lessor of any of its obligations thereunder after the rejection by
      such Ground Lessor under the Bankruptcy Code, then Borrower shall not
      effect any offset of the amounts so objected to by Lender. If Lender has
      failed to object as aforesaid within ten (10) days after notice from
      Borrower in accordance with the first sentence of this subsection,
      Borrower may proceed to offset the amounts set forth in Borrower's notice
      to Lender;

            (v) In any action, proceeding, motion or notice shall be commenced
      or filed in respect of any Ground Lessor of all or any part any Individual
      Property subject to a Ground Lease in connection with any case under the
      Bankruptcy Code, Lender and Borrower shall cooperatively conduct and
      control any such litigation with counsel agreed upon between Borrower and
      Lender in connection with such litigation. Borrower shall, upon demand,
      pay to Lender all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
      and costs) actually paid or actually incurred by Lender in connection with
      the cooperative prosecution or conduct of any such proceedings. All such
      costs and expenses shall be secured by the Lien of the applicable Security
      Instrument; and

            (vi) Borrower shall promptly, after obtaining knowledge of such
      filing, notify Lender orally of any filing by or against a Ground Lessor
      of a petition under the Bankruptcy Code. Borrower shall thereafter
      promptly give written notice of such filing to Lender, setting forth any
      information available to Borrower as to the date of such filing, the court
      in which such petition was filed, and the relief sought in such filing.


                                       85
<PAGE>
      Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender any and all notices, summons,
      pleadings, applications and other documents received by Borrower in
      connection with any such petition and any proceedings relating to such
      petition.

      With respect to each Individual Property listed on Schedule XIV hereof,
Borrower shall enter into a contract with a licensed industrial hygienist to
develop a fully documented O&M Program which Borrower shall submit within ninety
(90) days of the date hereof to Lender for its approval. Borrower further
covenants and agrees to implement and follow the terms and conditions of such
O&M Program during the term of the Loan, including any extension or renewal
thereof. Lender's requirement that Borrower develop and comply with the O&M
Program shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or modification of any of
Borrower's covenants and agreements with respect to Hazardous Materials or
Environmental Laws.

      5.1.26 Capital Budget

      Borrower shall to comply with Borrower's 2003 capital budget in all

agrees with Lender that it will not do, directly or indirectly, any of the

(d)(ii) only) shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      5.2.3 Change In Business.

      Borrower shall not enter into any line of business other than the
ownership, acquisition, development, operation, leasing and management of the
Properties (including providing services in connection therewith), or make any

                                       91

      contained shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay
      the obligations secured hereunder on the respective dates of payment
      provided for in the Note and this Agreement except to the extent such
      amounts are actually paid out of the proceeds of such business

      alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements (A) owner's

      terms consistent with the all risk insurance policy required under Section
      6.1(a)(i) hereof;


                                       92

      obtained by the Manager for the benefit of Borrower and the applicable
      Individual Property and

            (xii) such other insurance and in such amounts as are required
      pursuant to the Franchise Agreement or as Lender from time to time may
      reasonably request against such other insurable hazards which at the time
      are commonly insured against for property similar to each Individual
      Property located in or around the region in which the each Individual
      Property is located.

      (b) All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof shall be obtained

the syndicate) or at least 60% of the coverage (if there are 5 or more members
of the syndicate) is with carriers having), a claims paying ability rating by
S&P not lower than "AA-" and an A.M. Best rating of at least "A:IX" (a "Initial
Tier Insurer") and (2) the balance of the coverage is with one or more carriers
having a claims paying ability rating by S&P not lower than "BBB-" and an A.M.
Best rating of at least "A:IX"; provided, however, Endurance Specialty
Insurance, Ltd. shall be deemed a Initial Tier Insurer so long as it (x)
maintains an A.M. Best rating of at least "A-:IX" and (y) does not provide in
excess of $2,000,000 of the insurance coverage required pursuant to the Initial
Tier. The remaining portions of the insurance required pursuant to Section
6.1(a)(i), (iii) and (vi) hereof (the "Second Tier") may be with (1) one or more
primary insurers having (or a syndicate of insurers through which at least 75%
of the coverage (if there are 4 or fewer members of the syndicate) or at least
60% of the coverage (if there are 5 or more members of the syndicate) is with
carriers having), a claims paying ability rating by S&P not lower than "A" and
an A.M. Best rating of at least "A-:IX" (a "Second Tier Insurer") and (2) the
balance of the coverage is with one or more carriers having a claims paying

claims paying ability/financial strength rating of "A" (or its equivalent) or
better by all of the Rating Agencies and have an A.M. Best rating of "A:IX" or
greater (each such insurer shall be referred to below as a "Qualified Insurer").
Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of the Policies
theretofore furnished to Lender pursuant to Section 6.1(a), Borrower shall
deliver certified copies of the Policies marked "premium paid" or accompanied by
evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment of the premiums due thereunder (the
"Insurance Premiums"). In the event Borrower desires to obtain the insurance
required hereunder from an insurer not meeting the requirements of this Section
6.1(b), Borrower may request, in writing, Lender's approval of such insurer,
which approval may be given or withheld in Lender's sole discretion.

      (c) Borrower shall not obtain (i) any umbrella or blanket liability or
casualty Policy unless, in each case, such Policy is at least equal in scope of
coverage as if a "stand-alone" Policy meeting all of the requirement noted above
is provided as such Policy is approved in advance in writing by Lender and
Lender's interest is included therein as provided in this Agreement and such
Policy is issued by a Qualified Insurer, or (ii) separate insurance concurrent
in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in Section
6.1(a) to be furnished by, or which may be reasonably required to be furnished
by, Borrower. In the event Borrower obtains separate insurance or an umbrella or
a blanket policy, Borrower shall notify Lender of the same and shall cause
certified copies of each Policy to be delivered as required in Section 6.1(a).
Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the Individual
Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall
otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only
the Individual Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(a).
Notwithstanding Lender's approval of any umbrella or blanket liability or
casualty Policy hereunder, Lender reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
require Borrower to obtain a separate Policy in compliance with this Section
6.1.

      (d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 6.1(a) hereof,
except for the Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(v), shall name Lender and
Borrower as the insured or additional insured, as their respective interests may
appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler and machinery, and flood
insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard non-contributing
mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be
payable to Lender.

      (e) All Policies provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof shall contain
clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

            (i) no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for Borrower,
      or failure to comply with the provisions of any Policy which might
      otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof,
      shall in any way affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance
      insofar as Lender is concerned;

            (ii) the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to
      increase the coverage provided thereby) or cancelled without at least 30
      days' written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an
      insured;

            (iii) each Policy shall provide that the issuers thereof shall give
      written notice to Lender if the Policy has not been renewed thirty (30)
      days prior to its expiration; and

            (iv) Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums thereon
      or subject to any assessments thereunder.

      (f) Borrower shall furnish to Lender, on or before thirty (30) days after
the close of each of Borrower's fiscal years, a statement certified by Borrower
or a duly authorized officer of Borrower of the amounts of insurance maintained
in compliance herewith, of the risks covered by such insurance and of the
insurance company or companies which carry such insurance and, if requested by
Lender, verification of the adequacy of such insurance by an independent
insurance broker or appraiser acceptable to Lender.

      (g) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all
insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have the
right, with prior notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Properties, including, without
limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole
discretion deems appropriate, and all expenses incurred by Lender in connection
with such action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall
be paid by Borrower to Lender upon demand and until paid shall be secured by the
Security Instruments and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

      (h) In the event of a foreclosure of any of the Security Instruments, or
other transfer of title to any Individual Property in extinguishment in whole or
in part of the Debt all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the
Policies then in force and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest
in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event
of such other transfer of title.

      SECTION 6.2 Casualty.

      If an Individual Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in
part, by fire or other casualty (a "Casualty"), Borrower shall give prompt
notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently
prosecute the completion of the Restoration of the Individual Property as nearly
as possible to the condition the Individual Property was in immediately prior to
such Casualty, with such alterations as may be reasonably approved by Lender and
otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such
Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender may, but
shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

      SECTION 6.3 Condemnation.

      Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of all or any part of any
Individual Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including, but not
limited to, any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If any Individual Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning
authority, Borrower shall, promptly commence and diligently prosecute the
Restoration of the applicable Individual Property and otherwise comply with the
provisions of Section 6.4. If any Individual Property is sold, through
foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender
shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Note shall
have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion
thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

      SECTION 6.4 Restoration.

      The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration of
any Individual Property:

      (a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and
00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) and the costs of completing the Restoration shall
be less than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00), the

all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower
delivers to Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to
satisfactorily complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.


                                       96

Proceeds" shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds received by
Lender pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) as a result

            the Condemnation or Casualty) shall have occurred and be continuing;

                  (B) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance Proceeds,
            less than thirty percent (30%) of the total floor area of the
            Improvements on the Individual Property has been damaged, destroyed
            or rendered unusable as a result of such Casualty or (2) in the
            event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less than ten
            percent (10%) of the land constituting the Individual Property is
            taken, and such land is located along the perimeter or periphery of
            the Individual Property, and no portion of the Improvements is
            located on such land;

                  (C) The Operating Lease shall remain in full force and effect
            during and after the completion of the Restoration;

                  (D) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
            reasonably practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days
            after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be,
            occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to satisfactory
            completion in compliance with all Applicable Laws, including,
            without limitation, all applicable Environmental Laws and in
            accordance with the terms and conditions of the Franchise Agreement;

                  (E) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits,
            including all scheduled payments of principal and interest under the
            Note, which will be incurred with respect to the Individual Property
            as a result of the occurrence of any such Casualty or Condemnation,
            whichever the case may be, will be covered out of (1) the Net
            Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage referred to in Section
            6.1(a)(iii), if applicable, or (3) by other funds of Borrower;

                  (F) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
            completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) six (6) months
            prior to the Maturity Date, (2) six (6) months after the occurrence
            of such Casualty or Condemnation, or (3) the earliest date required

<PAGE>
            are required in accordance with the provisions of this Section
            6.4(b) to remain in effect subsequent to the occurrence of such
            Casualty or Condemnation and the completion of the Restoration, or

            Agreement, (5) such time as may be required under Applicable Law, in
            order to repair and restore the applicable Individual Property to
            the condition it was in immediately prior to such Casualty or
            Condemnation or (6) the expiration of the insurance coverage
            referred to in Section 6.1(a)(iii);

                  (G) the Individual Property and the use thereof after the
            Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
            Applicable Laws;

                  (H) Lender shall be satisfied that the Debt Service Coverage
            Ratio for the twelve (12) month period immediately succeeding the
            completion of the Restoration shall be equal to or greater than 1.30
            to 1;

                  (I) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not
            result in the loss of access in any material respect to the
            Individual Property or the related Improvements;

                  (J) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
            Lender a signed detailed budget approved in writing by Borrower's
            architect or engineer stating the entire cost of completing the
            Restoration, which budget shall be acceptable to Lender;

                  (K) the Net Proceeds together with any Cash or Cash equivalent
            deposited by Borrower with Lender are sufficient in Lender's
            discretion to cover the cost of the Restoration;

                  (L) the Management Agreement in effect as of the date of the
            occurrence of such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may

            and shall not otherwise terminate as a result of the Casualty or
            Condemnation or the Restoration or (2) if terminated, shall have
            been replaced with a Replacement Management Agreement with a
            Qualified Manager, prior to the opening or reopening of the
            applicable Individual Property or any portion thereof for business
            with the public; and

                  (M) the Franchise Agreement is not terminated as a result of
            such Casualty or Condemnation.

            (ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an interest-bearing
      account and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of this
      Section 6.4(b), shall constitute additional security for the Debt and
      other obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be
      disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from time to time
      during the course of the Restoration, upon receipt of evidence
      satisfactory to Lender that (A) all materials installed and work and labor
      performed (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out of the
      requested disbursement) in connection with the Restoration have been paid
      for in full, and (B) there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders,
      mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of


                                       98
<PAGE>
      intention to file same, or any other Liens or encumbrances of any nature
      whatsoever on the Individual Property which have not either been fully
      bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or in the
      alternative fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the title
      company issuing the Title Insurance Policy.

            (iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with the
      Restoration, the cost of which is greater than $250,000.00, shall be
      subject to prior review and acceptance in all respects by Lender and by an
      independent consulting engineer selected by Lender (the "Casualty
      Consultant"). Lender shall have the use of the plans and specifications
      and all permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection
      with the Restoration. The identity of the contractors, subcontractors and
      materialmen engaged in the Restoration the cost of which is greater than
      $250,000.00, as well as the contracts under which they have been engaged,
      shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender and the Casualty
      Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with
      making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration including, without
      limitation, reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and the Casualty
      Consultant's fees, shall be paid by Borrower.

            (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
      the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
      incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration,
      as certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage. The
      term "Casualty Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%),
      of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
      Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, until the
      Restoration has been completed. The Casualty Retainage shall in no event,
      and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this
      Section 6.4(b), be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower
      from contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the
      Restoration. The Casualty Retainage shall not be released until the
      Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
      completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and
      that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the
      Individual Property have been obtained from all appropriate Governmental
      Authorities, and Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the
      costs of the Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full
      out of the Casualty Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release
      the portion of the Casualty Retainage being held with respect to any
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of
      the date upon which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed all
      work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions of
      the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the
      contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and
      evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the contractor,
      subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or
      by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy for the related
      Individual Property, and Lender receives an endorsement to such Title
      Insurance Policy insuring the continued priority of the Lien of the
      related Security Instrument and evidence of payment of any premium payable
      for such endorsement. If required by Lender, the release of any such
      portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety company,
      if any, which


                                       99
<PAGE>
      has issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor,
      subcontractor or materialman.

            (v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
      Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

            (vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
      thereof shall not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation with the
      Casualty Consultant, if any, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of
      the costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be incurred in
      connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower shall deposit
      the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency") with Lender before any
      further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net Proceeds
      Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall be
      disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration
      on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds,
      and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute
      additional security for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan
      Documents.

            (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
      balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender
      after the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has
      been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b),
      and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all
      costs incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full,
      shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default
      shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this Agreement
      or any of the other Loan Documents.

      (c) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 6.4(b)(vii) may be retained and applied by Lender toward the payment
of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority and
proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, at the
discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to
Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall approve, in its discretion. If Lender
shall receive and retain Net Proceeds, the Lien of the Security Instruments
shall be reduced only by the amount thereof received and retained by Lender and
actually applied by Lender in reduction of the Debt.

      VII. RESERVE FUNDS

      SECTION 7.1 Required Repair Funds.

      7.1.1 Deposits.

      On the Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit into an escrow account with
Lender (the "Required Repair Account") the amount for each Individual Property
set forth on such Schedule III hereto to perform the Required Repairs for such
Individual Property. Amounts so deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender in
accordance with Section 7.7 hereof. Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be
referred to as Borrower's "Required Repair Fund." Borrower shall


                                      100
<PAGE>
perform the repairs at the Properties, as more particularly set forth on
Schedule III hereto (such repairs hereinafter referred to as "Required
Repairs"). Borrower shall complete the Required Repairs on or before the date
which is three hundred sixty five (365) days from the date hereof. It shall be
an Event of Default under this Agreement if (a) Borrower does not complete the
Required Repairs at each Individual Property within three hundred sixty five
(365) days from the date hereof, or (b) Borrower does not satisfy each condition
contained in Section 7.1.2 hereof. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Lender, at its option, may withdraw all Required Repair Funds from the Required
Repair Account and Lender may apply such funds either to completion of the
Required Repairs at one or more of the Properties or toward payment of the Debt
in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply Required Repair Funds shall be
in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      7.1.2 Release of Required Repair Funds.

      Lender shall disburse to Borrower the Required Repair Funds from the
Required Repair Account from time to time upon satisfaction by Borrower of each
of the following conditions: (a) Borrower shall submit a written request for
payment to Lender at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which Borrower
requests such payment be made and specifies the Required Repairs to be paid, (b)
on the date such request is received by Lender and on the date such payment is
to be made, no Event of Default shall exist and remain uncured, (c) Lender shall
have received an Officers' Certificate (i) stating that all Required Repairs at
the applicable Individual Property to be funded by the requested disbursement
have been completed in good and workmanlike manner and, to the best of
Borrower's knowledge, in accordance with all Legal Requirements and
Environmental Laws, such certificate to be accompanied by a copy of any license,
permit or other approval by any Governmental Authority required to commence
and/or complete the Required Repairs, (ii) identifying each Person that supplied
materials or labor in connection with the Required Repairs performed at such
Individual Property with respect to the reimbursement to be funded by the
requested disbursement, and (iii) stating that each such Person has been paid in
full upon such disbursement, such Officers' Certificate to be accompanied by
lien waivers or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender, (d) at
Lender's option, a title search for such Individual Property indicating that
such Individual Property is free from all Liens, claims and other encumbrances
not previously approved by Lender, and (e) Lender shall have received such other
evidence as Lender shall reasonably request that the Required Repairs at such
Individual Property to be funded by the requested disbursement have been
completed and are paid for upon such disbursement to Borrower. Lender shall not
be required to make disbursements from the Required Repair Account with respect
to any Individual Property unless such requested disbursement is in an amount
greater than $25,000 (or a lesser amount if the total amount in the Required
Repair Account is less than $25,000, in which case only one disbursement of the
amount remaining in the account shall be made). Lender shall not be obligated to
make disbursements from the Required Repair Account with respect to an
Individual Property in excess of the amount allocated for such Individual
Property as set forth on Schedule III hereof. Upon Lender's receipt of evidence
of completion of all Required Repairs in accordance with the terms hereof, any
remaining Required Repair Funds shall be disbursed to (i) provided no Mezzanine
Event of Default or Junior Mezzanine Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower or during an Excess Cash Flow Sweep Period, the Excess Cash
Flow Account or (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a


                                      101
<PAGE>
Mezzanine Event of Default or Junior Mezzanine Event of Default, Mezzanine
Lender or Junior Mezzanine Lender, as applicable.

      SECTION 7.2 Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.

      Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the
Taxes (the "Monthly Tax Deposit") that Lender estimates will be payable during
the next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with Lender
sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to their
respective due dates; and (b) at the option of Lender, if the liability or
casualty Policy maintained by Borrower covering the Properties shall not
constitute an approved blanket or umbrella Policy pursuant to Section 6.1(c)
hereof, or Lender shall require Borrower to obtain a separate Policy pursuant to
Section 6.1(c) hereof, one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums (the "Monthly
Insurance Premium Deposit") that Lender estimates will be payable for the
renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in
order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance
Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said
amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund"). In the event Lender shall elect to collect payments in escrow for
Insurance Premiums pursuant to clause (b) above, Borrower shall pay to Lender an
initial deposit to be determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, to increase
the amounts in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to an amount which, together
with anticipated Monthly Insurance Premium Deposits, shall be sufficient to pay
all Insurance Premiums as they become due. The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and
the payments of interest or principal or both, payable pursuant to the Note and
this Agreement, shall be added together and shall be paid as an aggregate sum by
Borrower to Lender. Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to
payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower
pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof. In making any payment relating to the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or
estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or
insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the
accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax,
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount
of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and
Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future
payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. In allocating such
excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender to be the
owner of the Properties. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. If at
any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is
not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates
set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such
determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments to Lender by the
amount that Lender estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least
thirty (30) days prior to delinquency of the Taxes and/or thirty (30) days prior
to expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.


                                      102
<PAGE>
      SECTION 7.3 Replacements and Replacement Reserve.

      7.3.1 Replacement Reserve Fund.

      Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date, the Replacement Reserve
Monthly Deposit for Capital Expenditures required to be made to the Properties
during the calendar year, as may be necessary to maintain and operate first
class, reputable hotels in the manner and quality of the hotels operated at the
Properties on the date hereof (collectively, the "Replacements"). Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "Replacement Reserve
Fund".

      7.3.2 Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account.

      (a) Lender shall make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account
to reimburse Borrower only for the costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not
be obligated to make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine maintenance (other than
Replacements) to an Individual Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed
from the Required Repair Fund.

      (b) Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of
the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2, disburse to Borrower amounts
from the Replacement Reserve Account necessary to reimburse Borrower for the
actual costs of Replacements. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse
funds from the Replacement Reserve Account if an Event of Default exists.

      (c) Each request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account
shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Lender and shall specify (i) the
specific Replacements for which the disbursement is requested, (ii) the quantity
and price of each item purchased, if the Replacement includes the purchase or
replacement of specific items, (iii) the price of all materials (grouped by type
or category) used in any Replacement other than the purchase or replacement of
specific items, and (iv) the cost of all contracted labor or other services
applicable to each Replacement for which the disbursement is requested. With
each request Borrower shall certify that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge,
all Replacements have been made in accordance with all applicable Legal
Requirements of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
applicable Individual Property to which the Replacements are being provided.
Upon request of Lender in connection with each request for disbursement in
excess of $200,000, Borrower shall provide Lender with copies of invoices for
amounts in excess of $100,000 for items or materials purchased or contracted
labor or services. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence of completion
satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable judgment.

      (d) Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with the Replacements
with respect to each request for disbursement prior to submitting such request
for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or, at the request of
Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower and the
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or other party to
whom payment is due in connection with a Replacement. In the case of payments
made by joint check, Lender may require a waiver of lien from each Person
receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement from the Replacement Reserve


                                      103

Account. In addition, as a condition to any disbursement, Lender may require
Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each contractor, supplier, materialman,
mechanic or subcontractor who receives payment in an amount equal to or greater
than $100,000 for completion of its work or delivery of its materials. Any lien
waiver delivered hereunder shall conform to the requirements of Applicable Law
and shall cover all work performed and materials supplied (including equipment
and fixtures) for the applicable Individual Property by that contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the
current reimbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check,
the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

      (e) Borrower shall not make a request for disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account more frequently than once in any calendar month and
(except in connection with the final disbursement) the total cost of all
Replacements in any request shall not be less than $25,000.

      7.3.3 Performance of Replacements.

      (a) Borrower shall make Replacements when required in order to keep each
Individual Property in condition and repair consistent with other first class,
full service hotels in the same market segment and under the same franchisor in
the metropolitan area in which the respective Individual Property is located,
and to keep each Individual Property or any portion thereof from deteriorating.
Borrower shall complete all Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as
soon as practicable following the commencement of making each such Replacement.

      (b) Intentionally Omitted.

      (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
in the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that any Replacement
is not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that any Replacement
has not been completed in a workmanlike or timely manner, Lender shall have the
option, without providing any prior notice to Borrower, to withhold disbursement
for such unsatisfactory Replacement and to proceed under existing contracts or,
upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Borrower, to contract with
third parties to complete such Replacement and to apply the Replacement Reserve
Fund toward the labor and materials necessary to complete such Replacement and
to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon an Event of
Default hereunder.

      (d) In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making of the
Replacements pursuant to Section 7.3.3(c) above, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower grants Lender the right to
enter onto any Individual Property and perform any and all work and labor
necessary to complete or make the Replacements and/or employ watchmen to protect
such Individual Property from damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the
extent not from the Replacement Reserve Fund, shall be deemed to have been
advanced under the Loan to Borrower and secured by the Security Instruments. For
this purpose, Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful
attorney-in-fact with


                                      104
<PAGE>
full power of substitution to complete or undertake the Replacements in the name
of Borrower. Such power of attorney shall be deemed to be a power coupled with
an interest and cannot be revoked. Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as
follows: (i) to use any funds in the Replacement Reserve Account for the purpose
of making or completing the Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes
and corrections to the Replacements as shall be necessary or desirable to
complete the Replacements; (iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors,
agents, architects and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (iv)
to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may
become Liens against any Individual Property, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v)
to execute all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may
be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend all
actions or proceedings in connection with any Individual Property or the
rehabilitation and repair of any Individual Property; and (vii) to do any and
every act which Borrower might do in its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
Agreement.

      (e) Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender responsible for
making or completing the Replacements; (ii) require Lender to expend funds in
addition to the Replacement Reserve Fund to make or complete any Replacement;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the Replacements; or (iv) obligate Lender
to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement.

      (f) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and representatives
(including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or inspector) or
third parties making Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3 to enter onto
each Individual Property during normal business hours (subject to the rights of
tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Replacements and all
materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans and shop
drawings relating to such Replacements which are or may be kept at each
Individual Property, and to complete any Replacements made pursuant to this
Section 7.3.3. Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to
cooperate with Lender or Lender's representatives or such other persons
described above in connection with inspections described in this Section
7.3.3(f) or the completion of Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3.

      (g) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may require an inspection of an Individual Property at Borrower's expense
prior to making a monthly disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account,
with respect to each Individual Property, in order to verify completion of the
Replacements for which reimbursement is sought. Lender may require that such
inspection be conducted by an appropriate independent qualified professional
selected by Lender and/or may require a copy of a certificate of completion by
an independent qualified professional acceptable to Lender prior to the
disbursement of any amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower shall
pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder, whether such inspection
is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified professional.

      (h) The Replacements and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any other
item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be constructed, installed or
completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialmen's or
other Liens.


                                      105
<PAGE>
      (i) Before each disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account relating
to actual physical work on the Improvements in excess of $200,000 with respect
to each Individual Property, Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender with
a search of title to the applicable Individual Property effective to the date of
the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's or materialmen's Liens
or other Liens of any nature have been placed against the applicable Individual
Property since the date of recordation of the related Security Instrument and
that title to such Individual Property is free and clear of all Liens (other
than the Lien of the related Security Instrument and other Permitted
Encumbrances).

      (j) All Replacements shall comply with all applicable Legal Requirements
of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the applicable
Individual Property and applicable insurance requirements including, without
limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental
regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

      (k) In addition to any insurance required under the Loan Documents,
Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided workmen's compensation insurance,
builder's risk, and public liability insurance and other insurance to the extent
required under Applicable Law in connection with a particular Replacement. All
such policies shall be in form and amount reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All
such policies which can be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss
payable to Lender or its assigns shall be so endorsed. Certified copies of such
policies shall be delivered to Lender

      7.3.4 Failure to Make Replacements.

      (a) It shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement if Borrower fails
to comply with any provision of this Section 7.3 and such failure is not cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice from Lender. Upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default, Lender may use the Replacement Reserve Fund (or any portion
thereof) for any purpose, including but not limited to completion of the
Replacements as provided in Sections 7.3.3(c) and 7.3.3(d), or for any other
repair or replacement to any Individual Property or toward payment of the Debt
in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply the Replacement Reserve Funds
shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any
portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on account of an Event of Default to
payment of the Debt or in any specific order or priority.

      7.3.5 Balance in the Replacement Reserve Account.

      The insufficiency of any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account shall
not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all preservation and
maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.


                                      106

      SECTION 7.4 Ground Lease Escrow Fund.

      In the event that the annual Ground Rent due pursuant to a Ground Lease is
in excess of $100.00, Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date an
amount (the "Monthly Ground Rent Deposit") that is estimated by Lender to be due
and payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease for all rent and any and all
other charges (the "Ground Rent") which may be due by Borrower under the Ground
Lease in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all sums
payable under the Ground Lease at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
dates due (said amounts, hereinafter called the "Ground Lease Escrow Fund"). The
Ground Lease Escrow Fund is for the purpose of paying all sums due under the
Ground Lease. Upon Borrower's failure to pay any Ground Rents pursuant to the
Ground Lease, Lender may, in its discretion, apply any amounts held in the
Ground Lease Escrow Fund to the payment of such Ground Rent; provided however,
that the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall not be deemed to create any
obligation on the part of Lender to pay any such Ground Rent from amounts on
deposit in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund. Such deposit may be increased by Lender
in the amount Lender deems is necessary in its reasonable discretion based on
any increases in the Ground Rent due under the Ground Lease.

      SECTION 7.5 UST Reserve Funds.

      7.5.1 Deposits.

      On the Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit with Lender $62,500.00 to
perform any Required Remediation for the Omaha Property. Amounts so deposited
with Lender shall be held by Lender in accordance with this Section. Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "UST Reserve Fund."
Borrower shall complete such Required Remediation within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the Closing Date. It shall be an Event of Default under this
Agreement if Borrower does not complete the Required Remediation in accordance
with the terms hereof within such one hundred eighty (180) day period. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender, at its option, may withdraw all UST
Reserve Funds from the UST Reserve Account and Lender may apply such funds
either to the completion of the Required Remediation or toward payment of the
Debt in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply UST Reserve Funds shall be in
addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      7.5.2 Release of UST Reserve Funds.

      Lender shall disburse to Borrower the UST Reserve Funds from the UST
Reserve Account upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following
conditions: (a) No Event of Default shall then exist, (b) Borrower shall have
delivered evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the Required
Remediation has been completed in accordance with all applicable Environmental
Laws (including, without limitation, obtaining any necessary permits, licenses,
approvals or letters from the applicable Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over monitoring and compliance of the Required Remediation
evidencing that the Required Remediation has been completed in accordance with
all applicable Environmental Laws (including a so-called "No Further Action
Letter")), and (c) at Lender's option, a title search for


                                      107
<PAGE>
such Individual Property indicating that such Individual Property is free from
all environmental Liens, claims and other encumbrances other than the Permitted
Encumbrances. Upon the earlier of (1) Borrower's completion of all Required
Remediation and the satisfaction of all of the requirements set forth in this
Section 7.5.2 with respect to such Required Remediation or (2) payment in full
by Borrower of all sums evidenced by the Note and secured by the Security
Instruments, Lender shall disburse to Borrower all of the UST Reserve Funds.

      SECTION 7.6 Reserve Funds, Generally.

      (a) Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security interest
in each of the Reserve Funds and the related Accounts and any and all monies now
or hereafter deposited in each Reserve Fund and related Account as additional
security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in accordance
herewith, the Reserve Funds and the related Accounts shall constitute additional
security for the Debt.

      (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may, in addition to
any and all other rights and remedies available to Lender, apply any sums then
present in any or all of the Reserve Funds to the payment of the Debt in any
order in its sole discretion.

      (c) The Reserve Funds shall not constitute trust funds and may be
commingled with other monies held by Lender.

      (d) The Reserve Funds shall be held in interest bearing accounts and all
earnings or interest on a Reserve Fund shall be added to and become a part of
such Reserve Fund and shall be disbursed in the same manner as other monies
deposited in such Reserve Fund, except that earnings or interest on the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund shall not be added to or become a part thereof and shall
be the sole property of and shall be paid to Lender.

      (e) Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any Reserve
Fund or related Account or the monies deposited therein or permit any lien or
encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1
Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be
filed with respect thereto.

      (f) Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from and
against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses,
damages, obligations and costs and expenses (including litigation costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected
with the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts or the performance of the
obligations for which the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts were
established, except to the extent arising from the fraud, illegal acts, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Lender, its agents or employees. Borrower
shall assign to Lender all rights and claims Borrower may have against all
Persons supplying labor, materials or other services which are to be paid from
or secured by the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts; provided, however, that
Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event of Default has
occurred and remains uncured.

      Individual Property, or if any other such event shall occur or condition
      shall exist, if the effect of such event or condition is to accelerate the
      maturity of any portion of the Debt or to permit Lender to accelerate the
      maturity of all or any portion of the Debt.

      (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default described in clauses (vi) or (vii) above) and at any time thereafter, in
addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take
such action, without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect
and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to all or any Individual


                                      112
<PAGE>
Property, including, without limitation, declaring the Debt to be immediately
due and payable, and Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or
remedies provided in the Loan Documents against Borrower and any or all of the
Properties, including, without limitation, all rights or remedies available at
law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described in clauses (vi) or
(vii) above, the Debt and all other obligations of Borrower hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents shall immediately and automatically become due and
payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such
notice or demand, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding.

      SECTION 8.2 Remedies.

      (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of
the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and
delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised
by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the
Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to all or any
Individual Property or any other Collateral. Any such actions taken by Lender
shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly,
successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender
may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and
remedies of Lender permitted by Applicable Law, equity or contract or as set
forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i)
Lender is not subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or rule,
and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender
shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its
remedies against the Properties and the other Collateral and each Security
Instrument has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

      (b) With respect to Borrower and the Properties, nothing contained herein
or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to resort
to any Individual Property or Collateral for the satisfaction of any of the Debt
in preference or priority to any other Individual Property or Collateral, and
Lender may seek satisfaction out of all of the Properties or any other
Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of the
Debt. In addition, Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially
foreclose the Security Instruments in any manner and for any amounts secured by
the Security Instruments then due and payable as determined by Lender in its
sole discretion including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i)
in the event Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment
of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may
foreclose one or more of the Security Instruments to recover such delinquent
payments, or (ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire
outstanding principal balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more of
the Security Instruments to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan
as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or more of the
Security Instruments as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial
foreclosures, the Properties shall remain subject to the


                                      113
<PAGE>
Security Instruments to secure payment of sums secured by the Security
Instruments and not previously recovered.

      (c) Lender shall have the right, from time to time, to sever the Note and
the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, Security Instruments
and other security documents (the "Severed Loan Documents") in such
denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of
evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower
shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the
request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender
shall request in order to effect the severance described in the preceding
sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower
hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful
attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and execute
all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower
ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided,
however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power
until three (3) days after notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of
Lender's intent to exercise its rights under such power. The Severed Loan
Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants not
contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations and warranties
contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower only as of the
Closing Date.

      SECTION 8.3 Remedies Cumulative; Waivers.

      The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's rights, powers
and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time
and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay
or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one or more
Defaults or Events of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to
be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to
impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

      IX. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

      SECTION 9.1 Sale of Notes and Securitization

            Lender may, at any time, sell, pledge, transfer or assign the Note,
this Agreement, the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents, and any
or all servicing rights with respect thereto, or grant participations therein or
issue mortgage pass-through certificates or other securities (the "Securities")
evidencing a beneficial interest in a rated or unrated public offering or
private placement (a "Securitization"). At the request of the holder of the Note
and, to the extent not already required to be provided by Borrower under this
Agreement, Borrower (subject to the limitations set forth at the end of this
Section 9.1) shall use its best efforts to satisfy the market standards to which
Lender customarily adheres or which may be reasonably


                                      114
<PAGE>
required in the marketplace or by the Rating Agencies in connection with a
Securitization or the sale of the Note or the participations or Securities,
including, without limitation, to:

      (a) (i) provide such financial and other information with respect to the
Properties, Borrower and the Manager, (ii) provide budgets relating to the
Properties and (iii) permit Lender or Lender's designees to perform or permit or
cause to be performed or permitted such site inspection, appraisals, market
studies, environmental reviews and reports (Phase I's and, if appropriate, Phase
II's), engineering reports and other due diligence investigations of the
Properties, as may be reasonably requested by the holder of the Note or the
Rating Agencies or as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the
Securitization (the "Provided Information"), together, if customary, with
appropriate verification and/or consents of the Provided Information through
letters of accountants or opinions of counsel of independent attorneys
acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

      (b) if required by the Rating Agencies, deliver (i) a revised Insolvency
Opinion, (ii) revised opinions of counsel as to due execution and enforceability
with respect to the Properties, Borrower, Guarantor, Indemnitor, Principal, the
Operating Lessee SPE Entities and their respective Affiliates and the Loan
Documents, and (iii) revised organizational documents for Borrower, Guarantor,
Indemnitor, Principal the Operating Lessee SPE Entities and their respective
Affiliates (including, without limitation, such revisions as are necessary to
comply with the provisions of Section 4.1.35 hereof), which counsel, opinions
and organizational documents shall be satisfactory to Lender and the Rating
Agencies;

      (c) if required by the Rating Agencies, deliver such additional tenant
estoppel letters, subordination agreements or other agreements from parties to
agreements that affect the Properties, reasonably requested by Lender and the
Rating Agencies

      (d) execute such amendments to the Loan Documents and organizational
documents as may be reasonably requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating
Agencies or otherwise to effect the Securitization; provided, however, that
Borrower shall not be required to modify or amend any Loan Document if such
modification or amendment would (i) materially increase Borrower's obligations
or out-of-pocket costs related to compliance with this Agreement, (except for
modifications and amendments required to be made pursuant to Section 9.1 (e)
below), (ii) change the interest rate, the stated maturity or the amortization
of principal set forth in the Note or (iii) modify or amend any other economic,
financial or payment term (or otherwise modify or amend in any material respect
any of the terms) of the Loan.

      (e) if Lender elects, in its sole discretion, prior to or upon a
Securitization, to split the Loan into two or more parts, or the Note into
multiple component notes or tranches which may have different interest rates,
amortization payments and principal amounts, Borrower agrees to cooperate with
Lender in connection with the foregoing and to execute the required
modifications and amendments to the Note, this Agreement and the Loan Documents
and to provide opinions necessary to effectuate the same. Such Notes or
components may be assigned different interest rates, so long as the initial
weighted average of such interest rates does not exceed the Applicable Interest
Rate and the scheduled amortization payments do not exceed the Scheduled
Amortization Payment; and


                                      115
<PAGE>
      (f) make such representations and warranties as of the closing date of the
Securitization with respect to the Properties, Borrower, and the Loan Documents
as are customarily provided in securitization transactions and as may be
reasonably requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies and
consistent with the facts covered by such representations and warranties as they
exist on the date thereof, including the representations and warranties made in
the Loan Documents.

      Other than costs and expenses which are otherwise the responsible of
Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents, in connection with
Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 9.1, Borrower shall
only be responsible for the payment of (i) Borrower's legal counsel and
accountants and (ii) any internal, administrative or clerical cost and expenses
incurred by Borrower.

      SECTION 9.2 Securitization Indemnification.

      (a) Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information may be
included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus supplement, private placement
memorandum, offering circular or other offering document (each a "Disclosure
Document") and may also be included in filings (an "Exchange Act Filing") with
the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or provided or made available to Investors or
prospective Investors in the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service
providers relating to the Securitization. In the event that the Disclosure
Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all Securities, Borrower
will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the Disclosure Document
by providing all current information necessary to keep the Disclosure Document
accurate and complete in all material respects.

      (b) Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final private placement memorandum or (ii) a preliminary and
final prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable, or (iii) collateral
and structured term sheets or similar materials, an indemnification certificate
(A) certifying that Borrower has carefully examined such memorandum or
prospectus or term sheets, as applicable, including without limitation, the
sections entitled "Special Considerations," "Description of the Mortgages,"
"Description of the Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged Property," "The Manager," "The
Borrower" and "Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan," and such sections
(and any other sections reasonably requested) do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading in any material respect, (B) indemnifying Lender (and
for purposes of this Section 9.2, Lender hereunder shall include its officers
and directors), the Affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank ("JPMorgan Chase") that has
filed the registration statement relating to the Securitization (the
"Registration Statement"), each of its directors, each of its officers who have
signed the Registration Statement and each Person who controls the Affiliate
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act (collectively, the "JPMorgan Chase Group"), and JPMorgan Chase,
each of its directors and each Person who controls JPMorgan Chase within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "Underwriter Group")


                                      116
<PAGE>
for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, the "Liabilities")
to which Lender, the JPMorgan Chase Group or the Underwriter Group may become
subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in such
sections described in clause (A) above, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated in such sections or necessary in order to make the statements in such
sections or in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading in any material respect and (C) agreeing to reimburse Lender, the
JPMorgan Chase Group and the Underwriter Group for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by Lender the JPMorgan Chase Group and the Underwriter Group
in connection with investigating or defending the Liabilities; provided,
however, that Borrower will be liable in any such case under clauses (B) or (C)
above only to the extent that any such Liability arises out of or is based upon
any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower in
connection with the preparation of the memorandum or prospectus or in connection
with the underwriting of the debt, including, without limitation, financial
statements of Borrower, operating statements, rent rolls, environmental site
assessment reports and property condition reports with respect to the
Properties. This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which
Borrower may otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification provided for in
Clauses (B) and (C) above shall be effective whether or not an indemnification
certificate described in (A) above is provided and shall be applicable based on
information previously provided by Borrower or its Affiliates if Borrower does
not provide the indemnification certificate.

      (c) In connection with filings under the Exchange Act, Borrower agrees to
indemnify (i) Lender, the JPMorgan Chase Group and the Underwriter Group for
Liabilities to which Lender, the JPMorgan Chase Group or the Underwriter Group
may become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state in the Provided Information a material
fact required to be stated in the Provided Information in order to make the
statements in the Provided Information, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made not misleading in any material respect and (ii) reimburse
Lender, the JPMorgan Chase Group or the Underwriter Group for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by Lender, the JPMorgan Chase Group or the
Underwriter Group in connection with defending or investigating the Liabilities.

      (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9.2
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
Section 9.2, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with
any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
(or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.
After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this
Section 9.2 the


                                      117
<PAGE>
indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, if the
defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party to
parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more
than one such separate counsel unless an indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to another indemnified party.

      (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnifications provided for in Section 9.2(b) or
(c) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party in
respect of any Liabilities (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein
which would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 9.2(b) or (c), the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such Liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) JPMorgan Chase's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to information
concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii) the
opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any
other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined solely by pro rata or per capita allocation.

      (f) The liabilities and obligations of both Borrower and Lender under this
Section 9.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the satisfaction
and discharge of the Debt.

      SECTION 9.3 Servicer.

      At the option of Lender or Agent, the Loan may be serviced by a
servicer/trustee (the "Servicer") selected by Lender or Agent and Lender or
Agent may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the Servicer pursuant to a servicing
agreement (the "Servicing Agreement") between Lender or Agent and Servicer.

      SECTION 9.4 Exculpation.

      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.4 and comparable
provisions in the Security Instruments or in the other Loan Documents, Lender
shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or any of Borrower's
Affiliates to perform and observe the obligations contained in this Agreement,
the Note or the Security Instruments by any action or


                                      118
<PAGE>
proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or any of
Borrower's Affiliates, except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action
for specific performance or other appropriate action or proceeding to enable
Lender to enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the Note, the Security
Instruments, the other Loan Documents, and the interest in the Properties, the
Rents and any other Collateral created by this Agreement, the Note, the Security
Instruments and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that any judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to
the extent of Borrower's interest in the Properties, in the Rents and in any
other Collateral. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the Note and the Security
Instruments, agrees that it shall not, except as otherwise provided in this
Section 9.4 and comparable provisions in the Security Instruments, sue for, seek
or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower or any of Borrower's
Affiliates in any such action or proceeding, under or by reason of or under or
in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instruments or the
other Loan Documents. The provisions of this Section shall not, however, (i)
constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or
secured by this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instruments or the other Loan
Documents; (ii) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower as a party defendant
in any action or suit for judicial foreclosure and sale under the Security
Instruments; (iii) except as set forth in this Section 9.4, affect the validity
or enforceability of any indemnity (including, without limitation, the
Environmental Indemnity), guaranty (including, without limitation, the
Guaranty), master lease or similar instrument made in connection with this
Agreement, the Note, the Security Instruments, or the other Loan Documents; (iv)
impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a receiver; (v) except
as set forth in this Section 9.4, impair the enforcement of the Assignment of
Leases; (vi) impair the right of Lender to enforce the provisions of Sections
10.2 of the Security Instruments or Sections 4.1.8, 4.1.28, 5.1.9 and 5.2.8
hereof; or (vii) impair the right of Lender to obtain a deficiency judgment or
other judgment on the Note against Borrower to the extent necessary to (A)
preserve or enforce its rights and remedies against any Individual Property or
(B) obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to which Lender would otherwise be
entitled under the terms of this Agreement or the Security Instruments; provided
however, Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the extent of the Insurance
Proceeds and/or Awards.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9.4 to the contrary,
Borrower shall be personally liable to Lender for the Losses Lender incurs to
the extent due to: (i) fraud or material misrepresentation in connection with
the execution and the delivery of this Agreement, the Note, the Security
Instrument, or the other Loan Documents; (ii) Borrower's or Operating Lessee's
misapplication or misappropriation of Rents received by Borrower or Operating
Lessee after the occurrence of an Event of Default; (iii) Borrower's or
Operating Lessee's misapplication or misappropriation of Security Deposits or
Rents collected more than thirty (30) days in advance; (iv) Borrower's or
Operating Lessee's misapplication or the misappropriation of Insurance Proceeds
or Awards; (v) Borrower's or Operating Lessee's failure to pay Taxes, Other
Charges (except to the extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have been
deposited in escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms of Section 7.2 hereof),
charges for labor or materials or other charges that can create Liens on the
Properties; (vi) Borrower's or Operating Lessee's failure to return or to
reimburse Lender for all Personal Property taken from any Properties by or on
behalf of Borrower or Operating Lessee and not replaced with Personal Property
of comparable utility and value; (vii) any act of intentional waste or arson to
the Collateral by Borrower, Principal, the Operating Lessee SPE Entities or


                                      119
<PAGE>
any Affiliate or thereof or by any Indemnitor or Guarantor; (viii) any fees or
commissions paid by Borrower to Principal, the Operating Lessee SPE Entities or
any Affiliate of Borrower, Principal, the Operating Lessee SPE Entities,
Indemnitor, or Guarantor in violation of the terms of this Agreement, the Note,
the Security Instruments or the other Loan Documents; (ix) Borrower's failure to
comply with the provisions of Sections 4.1.39 and 5.1.19 of this Agreement; (x)
any Loss resulting from a Casualty due to Borrower's failure to obtain the
insurance required pursuant to Section 6.1; (xi) Borrower's default under
Section 5.1.10 hereof (after ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to
Borrower), (xii) if any Ground Lease is modified or terminated other than in
accordance with the terms hereof, (xiii) any Loss resulting from the
Jacksonville Property's failure to comply with applicable zoning ordinances
relating to density or number of hotel rooms and (xiv) any Loss paid to Hilton
Inns, Inc. or any Affiliate thereof (including, without limitation, any
termination or similar fees by, or on behalf of, Operating Lessee) resulting
from a termination of the franchise license agreement(s) relating to the Hilton
Franchised Properties.

      (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to pursue
recourse liability as set forth in Subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL AND
VOID and shall be of no further force and effect and the obligation to repay the
Debt shall become a personal recourse obligation of Borrower (i) in the event of
Borrower's or Principal's default under Section 4.1.35 hereof or Operating
Lessee's default under Section 12 of the Operating Lease Subordination Agreement
(such that such failure was considered by a court as a factor in the court's
finding for a consolidation of the assets of Borrower, Principal and/or
Operating Lessee with the assets of another Person) or any Transfer in violation
of the provisions of Section 5.2.10 hereof or Article 7 of the Security
Instruments, (ii) if any Individual Property or any part thereof shall become an
asset, or if Borrower, Principal, Ground Lessor, an Operating Lessee SPE Entity,
Mezzanine Borrower, Mezzanine Principal, Junior Mezzanine Borrower or Junior
Mezzanine Principal shall be a debtor, in (A) a voluntary bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding
commenced by any Person (other than Lender, Mezzanine Lender or Junior Mezzanine
Lender) and, with respect to such involuntary proceeding, Borrower consents or
fails to object to such proceedings) or if Borrower, Principal, Ground Lessor,
an Operating Lessee SPE Entity, Mezzanine Borrower, Mezzanine Principal, Junior
Mezzanine Borrower or Junior Mezzanine Principal has acted in concert with,
colluded or conspired with the party to cause the filing of such involuntary
proceeding or (iii) an Event of Default contemplated by Section 8.1(xi)(b),
8.1(xi)(c) or 8.1(xxiv)(b) hereof has occurred (unless caused by, or at the
request of Lender, Mezzanine Lender or Junior Mezzanine Lender); provided,
however, with respect to this Section 9.4(c)(iii) only, Borrower shall only be
liable on a recourse basis for the Allocated Loan Amounts (plus interest thereon
and costs and expenses relating thereto) of the Individual Properties that were
the cause of such Event of Default.

      (d) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which
Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of
the Bankruptcy Code to file a claim against Borrower or Principal for the full
amount of the indebtedness secured by the Security Instruments or to require
that all Collateral shall continue to secure all of the indebtedness owing to
Lender in accordance with this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instruments and
the other Loan Documents.

      (b) WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR ACTION ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER THIS

SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN IN NEW


                                      121
<PAGE>
YORK, NEW YORK, AND APPELLATE COURTS FROM ANY THEREOF, AND (B) IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE AT ANY TIME TO THE LAYING ON VENUE OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
NOTE OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT, IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS
BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTE OR
THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS INSTRUMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO PRECLUDE LENDER FROM
BRINGING AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT HERETO IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE PRECEDING CONSENTS TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE,
THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH NEW YORK COURTS IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 5-1402 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK OR ANY CORRESPONDING OR SUCCEEDING PROVISIONS THEREOF.

      SECTION 10.4 Modification, Waiver in Writing.

      No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement, the Note, or of any other Loan Document, nor
consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

      SECTION 10.5 Delay Not a Waiver.

      Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender or Borrower in
insisting upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement,
or exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note
or under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to
declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

      SECTION 10.6 Notices.

      All notices or other written communications hereunder shall be deemed to

      SECTION 10.7 Trial by Jury.

      BORROWER AND LENDER HEREBY AGREE NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE
TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE
EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY


                                      123
<PAGE>
BY BORROWER AND LENDER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE
AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE.
BORROWER AND LENDER ARE HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN
ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER AND LENDER, AS
APPLICABLE.

      SECTION 10.8 Headings.

      The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

      SECTION 10.9 Severability.

      Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted
in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under Applicable
Law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

      SECTION 10.10 Preferences.

      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Lender shall have the
continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse and reapply any and all
payments by Borrower to any portion of the obligations of Borrower hereunder. To
the extent Borrower makes a payment or payments to Lender, which payment or
proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, State or federal law,
common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds
received, the obligations hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such payment or
proceeds had not been received by Lender.

      SECTION 10.11 Waiver of Notice.

      Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

      SECTION 10.12 Remedies of Borrower.

      In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement


                                      124
<PAGE>
or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such agent, as the case may be, has an
obligation to act reasonably or promptly, Borrower agrees that neither Lender
nor its agents shall be liable for any monetary damages, and Borrower's sole
remedies shall be limited to commencing an action seeking injunctive relief or
declaratory judgment. The parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding to
determine whether Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined by an action
seeking declaratory judgment.

      SECTION 10.13 Expenses; Indemnity.

      (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Borrower covenants and
agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to reimburse, Lender within five (5)
days of receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
Lender in connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of furnishing
all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without limitation any opinions
requested by Lender as to any legal matters arising under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents with respect to the Properties); (ii) Borrower's ongoing
performance of and compliance with Borrower's respective agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part
to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, confirming compliance with environmental and insurance requirements;
(iii) Lender's ongoing performance and compliance with all agreements and
conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part
to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any consents, amendments,
waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and any other documents or matters requested by Lender; (v) securing Borrower's
compliance with any requests made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement;
(vi) the filing and recording fees and expenses, title insurance and reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel for providing to Lender all required legal
opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and perfecting the
Liens in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents; (vii) enforcing or preserving any rights, in response to third party
claims or the prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or other
litigation, in each case against, under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the Properties, or any other security given for the
Loan; and (viii) enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments due
from Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to
the Properties or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the
credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out"
or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower
shall not be liable for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent
the same arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender. Any cost and expenses due and payable to Lender may be
paid from any amounts in the Lockbox Account.

      (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for Lender in connection


                                      125
<PAGE>
with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or
threatened, whether or not Lender shall be designated a party thereto), that may
be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Lender in any manner relating to
or arising out of (i) any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any
material misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however, that Borrower
shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such
Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable
because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum
portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under Applicable Law to the
payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Lender.

      (c) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless Lender and the Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA, the Code, any State statute or other similar law that may be required, in
Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur, directly or indirectly, as a
result of a default under Sections 4.1.8 or 5.2.8 hereof.

      (d) Other than in connection with a Securitization, Borrower covenants and
agrees to pay for or, if Borrower fails to pay, to reimburse Lender for, (i) any
fees and expenses incurred by any Rating Agency in connection with any Rating
Agency review of the Loan, the Loan Documents or any transaction contemplated
thereby or (ii) any consent, approval, waiver or confirmation obtained from such
Rating Agency pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and Lender shall be entitled to require payment of such fees
and expenses as a condition precedent to the obtaining of any such consent,
approval, waiver or confirmation.

      SECTION 10.14 Schedules and Exhibits Incorporated.

      The Schedules and Exhibits annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein
as a part of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body
hereof.

      SECTION 10.15 Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses.

      Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and
the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to the Loan Documents which
Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of the Loan Documents, and no
such unrelated counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by
Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such
documents and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset,
counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly
waived by Borrower.


                                      126
<PAGE>
      SECTION 10.16 No Joint Venture or Partnership; No Third Party
Beneficiaries.

      (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender.
Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership,
tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor
to grant Lender any interest in the Properties other than that of mortgagee,
beneficiary or lender.

      (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit
of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower
(or an Affiliate of either of the foregoing acting on behalf of Borrower or
Lender, as applicable) any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or
observance of any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions
to the obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

      SECTION 10.17 Publicity.

      All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or their
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents, to
Lender, JPMorgan Chase, or any of their Affiliates shall be subject to the prior
written approval of Lender, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, disclosure required by any federal or State
securities laws, rules or regulations, as determined by Borrower's counsel,
shall not be subject to the prior written approval of Lender.

      SECTION 10.18 Cross-Default; Cross-Collateralization; Waiver of
Marshalling of Assets.

      (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower upon
the security of its collective interest in the Properties and in reliance upon
the aggregate of the Properties taken together being of greater value as
collateral security than the sum of each Individual Property taken separately.
Borrower agrees that the Security Instruments are and will be
cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event of
Default under any of the Security Instruments shall constitute an Event of
Default under each of the other Security Instruments which secure the Note; (ii)
an Event of Default under the Note or this Agreement shall constitute an Event
of Default under each Security Instrument; (iii) each Security Instrument shall
constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket lien were placed on all
of the Properties as security for the Note; and (iv) such
cross-collateralization shall in no event be deemed to constitute a fraudulent
conveyance.

      (b) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower, for
itself and its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the
assets of Borrower, Mezzanine


                                      127
<PAGE>
Borrower and of the Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in
the event of foreclosure of all or any of the Security Instruments, and agrees
not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets,
the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration
of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or
affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Properties
for the collection of the Debt without any prior or different resort for
collection or of the right of Lender to the payment of the Debt out of the net
proceeds of the Properties in preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In
addition, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the
event of foreclosure of any or all of the Security Instruments, any equitable
right otherwise available to Borrower which would require the separate sale of
the Properties or require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any Individual
Property or any combination of the Properties before proceeding against any
other Individual Property or combination of Properties; and further in the event
of such foreclosure Borrower does hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at
the option of Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of
any combination of the Properties.

      SECTION 10.19 Waiver of Counterclaim.

      Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

      SECTION 10.20 Conflict; Construction of Documents; Reliance.

      In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and
any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.
The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent counsel
in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan Documents
and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing
their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that,
with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and
advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any
statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any parent,
subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any limitation
whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any
of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which govern the
Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of
Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower
hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on
the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of any such rights
or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real
estate financings and other real estate transactions and investments which may
be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business of Borrower or its
Affiliates.

      SECTION 10.21 Brokers and Financial Advisors.

      Borrower and Lender hereby represent that they have dealt with no
financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind


                                      128
<PAGE>
(including Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in any way relating
to or arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of
Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The provisions
of this Section 10.21 shall survive the expiration and termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Debt.

      SECTION 10.22 Prior Agreements.

      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire agreement
of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such parties,
whether oral or written, between Borrower and/or its Affiliates and Lender are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      SECTION 10.23 Counterparts.

      This Agreement may be executed in any number of duplicate originals and
each duplicate original shall be deemed to be an original. This Agreement may be
executed in several counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed an
original instrument and all of which together shall constitute a single
Agreement.

      SECTION 10.24 Liability.

      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower
and Lender and their respective successors and assigns forever.
