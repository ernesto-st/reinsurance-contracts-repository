with, each Underwriter as set forth below in this Section 1.

            (a) The Company has prepared and filed with the Commission a
      registration statement (file number 333-117804) on Form S-1, including a
      related preliminary prospectus, for registration under the Act of the
      offering and sale of the Securities. The Company may have filed one or
      more amendments thereto, including a related preliminary prospectus, each
      of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will next file
      with the Commission one of the following: either (1) prior to the
      Effective Date of such registration statement, a further amendment to such
      registration statement (including the form of final prospectus) or (2)
      after the Effective Date of such registration statement, a final
      prospectus in accordance with Rules 430A and 424(b). In the case of clause
      (2), the Company has included in such registration statement, as amended
      at the Effective Date, all information (other than Rule 430A Information)
      required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in such
      registration statement and the Prospectus. As filed, such amendment and
      form of final prospectus, or such final prospectus, shall contain all Rule
      430A Information, together with all other such required information, and,
      except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a
      modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished
      to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the
      Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information
      and other changes (beyond that contained in the latest Preliminary
      Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Execution Time,
      will be included or made therein.

            (b) On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did or will,
      and when the Prospectus is delivered to the Underwriters for use in
      connection with

2
<PAGE>

      this offering, and first filed (if required) in accordance with Rule
      424(b) and on the Closing Date (as defined herein) and on any date on
      which Option Securities are purchased, if such date is not the Closing
      Date (a "settlement date"), the Prospectus (and any supplements thereto)
      will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
      the Act and the rules thereunder; on the Effective Date and at the
      Execution Time, the Registration Statement did not or will not contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
      therein not misleading; and, on the Effective Date, the Prospectus, if not
      filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), will not, and on the date of any filing
      pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date and any settlement date,
      the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not, include
      any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
      necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
      circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
      however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the
      information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, or
      the Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in
      conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on

      described in the Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a
      foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each
      jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure
      to so qualify or be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to

      prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and the
      Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions

      granted to or by the Company or any Subsidiary to purchase shares of
      common stock or other securities of any Subsidiary and there are no
      commitments, plans or arrangements to issue any such securities or any

      fine or penalty levied against it, to the extent that any of the foregoing

      terms of such policies and instruments in all material respects; and there

      liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause; neither the
      Company nor any such Subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage
      sought or applied for; and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has
      any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing
      insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar
      coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its
      business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, except
      as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of any
      supplement thereto filed after the date hereof).

            (w) No Subsidiary of the Company is currently prohibited, directly

      Company or any other Subsidiary of the Company, except as described in or
      contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto filed
      after the date hereof).

      conduct their respective businesses except for such Governmental
      Authorizations the failure of which to possess would not reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the Governmental
      Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect; and neither the
      Company nor any such Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings
      relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate,
      authorization or permit which, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject
      of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or
      contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto filed
      after the date hereof); the Company and the Insurance Subsidiaries have
      filed with the appropriate governmental authorities (including regulatory
      authorities) all reports, documents or other information required to be

      permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
      authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
      with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is

            (z) The Company has not taken, directly or indirectly, any action
      designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected
      to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization
      or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate
      the sale or resale of the Securities.

            (aa) The Company and its Subsidiaries are (i) in compliance with any
      and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations

      Environmental Laws to conduct their respective businesses and (iii) have
      not received notice of any actual or potential liability under any
      environmental law, except where such non-compliance with Environmental
      Laws, failure to receive required permits, licenses or other approvals, or
      liability would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
      aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect, and except as set forth in
      or contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto
      filed after the date hereof). Except as set forth in the Prospectus,
      neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has been named as a

      the Securities to be sold by it hereunder free and clear of all liens,
      encumbrances, equities and claims and has duly endorsed such Securities in
      blank, and, assuming that each Underwriter acquires its interest in the
      Securities it has purchased from the Selling Stockholder without notice of
      any adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the New York
      Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC")), each Underwriter that has purchased such
      Securities delivered on the Closing Date to The Depository Trust Company
      or other securities intermediary by making payment therefor as provided
      herein, and that has had such Securities credited to the securities
      account or accounts of such Underwriters maintained with The Depository
      Trust Company or such other securities intermediary will have acquired a
      security entitlement (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(17) of the
      UCC) to such Securities purchased by such Underwriter, and no action based
      on an adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the UCC) may
      be asserted against such Underwriter with respect to such Securities.

            (b) The Selling Stockholder has not taken, directly or indirectly,
      any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably
      be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise,
      stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company
      to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

            (c) The Selling Stockholder has full right, power and authority to
      enter into this Agreement and to sell, assign, transfer and deliver the
      Securities to be sold by such Selling Stockholder hereunder. The Selling
      Stockholder has entered into and delivered to the Representatives a
      lock-up agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and the
      Selling Stockholder as full right, power and authority to enter into such
      lock-up agreement.

            (d) No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or
      governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by the
      Selling Stockholder of the transactions contemplated herein, except such
      as may have been obtained under the Act and such as may be required under
      the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and
      distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters and such other
      approvals as have been obtained.

            (e) Neither the sale of the Securities being sold by the Selling
      Stockholder nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein
      contemplated by the Selling Stockholder or the fulfillment of the terms
      hereof by the Selling Stockholder will conflict with, result in a breach
      or violation of, or constitute a default under (i) any law, (ii) the
      charter or code of regulations of the Selling Stockholder or (iii) the
      terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the
      Selling Stockholder is a party or bound, or any judgment, order or decree
      applicable to the Selling Stockholder of any court, regulatory body,
      administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction
      over the Selling Stockholder, except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii)
      above for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults as would not
      materially and adversely affect the validity of this Agreement or the
      ability of the Selling Stockholder to consummate the transactions
      contemplated hereby.

            (f) The sale of Securities by the Selling Stockholder pursuant
      hereto is not prompted by any non-public information concerning the
      Company or any of its subsidiaries.

            (g) In respect of any statements in or omissions from the
      Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any supplements thereto made
      in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing
      to the Company by the Selling Stockholder specifically for use in
      connection with the preparation thereof, the Selling Stockholder hereby
      makes the same representations and warranties to each Underwriter as the
      Company makes to such Underwriter under paragraph (i)(b) of this Section.

      pay for the Underwritten Securities, as set forth opposite such
      Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto. Said option may be exercised
      only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Underwritten Securities
      by the Underwriters. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at
      any time on or before the 30th day after the date of the Prospectus upon
      written notice by the Representatives to the Company and the Selling

Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder) by wire transfer payable in same-day
funds to the account specified by the Company (with respect to the Securities

Securities occurs after the Closing Date, the Company and the Selling
Stockholder will deliver to the Representatives on the settlement date for the
Option Securities, and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Option
Securities shall be conditioned upon receipt of, supplemental opinions,
certificates and letters confirming as of such date the opinions, certificates

            ARTICLE IV Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the
several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as
set forth in the Prospectus.

            ARTICLE V Agreements.

            Section 5.01 The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:

            (a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Registration
      Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment
      thereof, to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of
      the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the
      Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or any Rule 462(b)
      Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for
      your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment
      or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing
      sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective
      pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Prospectus is otherwise

15
<PAGE>

      required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Prospectus,
      properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form
      approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the
      applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and
      will provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives of
      such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives
      (1) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution
      Time, shall have become effective, (2) when the Prospectus, and any
      supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the
      Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration
      Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (3) when, prior to
      termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the
      Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (4) of
      any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the
      Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for
      any supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (5) of
      the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
      effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or
      threatening of any proceeding for that purpose of which the Company is
      aware and (6) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
      respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale
      in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding
      for such purpose. The Company will use its best effort to prevent the
      issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such
      qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal
      thereof.

            (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is
      required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of
      which the Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
      to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under
      which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend
      the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the
      Act or the rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the
      Representatives of any such event; (2) prepare and file with the
      Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this
      Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or
      omission or effect such compliance; and (3) supply any supplemented
      Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

            (c) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company
      shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in
      compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time, on the
      date of this Agreement, and the Company shall at the time of filing either
      pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration
      Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee
      pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act.

            (d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally
      available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings
      statement or

16
<PAGE>

      statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries which will satisfy the
      provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.

            (e) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for
      the Underwriters signed copies of the Registration Statement (including
      exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration
      Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a
      prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many
      copies of each Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and any
      supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.

            (f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of
      the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the
      Representatives may designate and will maintain such qualifications in
      effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities;
      provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do
      business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take
      any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other
      than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any
      jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or subject it to taxation in
      any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.

            (g) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of
      Citigroup Global Markets Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or
      otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to,
      or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by
      actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash
      settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or
      any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company),
      directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the
      filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or
      establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a
      call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange
      Act, any shares of Common Stock other than those being issued pursuant
      hereto or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable
      for, shares of Common Stock; or publicly announce an intention to effect
      any such transaction for a period of 180 days following the Execution
      Time, provided, however, that the Company may issue stock options,
      restricted stock and other awards pursuant to its employee or agent
      benefit plans described in the Prospectus (the "Benefit Plans"), issue and
      sell Common Stock pursuant to the Benefit Plans (or pursuant to an
      outstanding option or award issued under such plans) and the Company may
      issue Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the non-voting common
      stock of the Company outstanding at the Execution Time.

            and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
            in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires

            action, suit, proceeding or investigation that would reasonably be
            expected to result in the revocation, termination or suspension of

            advantage of profitable opportunities," "Risk Factors -- There are
            anti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents
            and in laws of the State of New Jersey that could delay or impede
            the removal of our directors and management and could make a merger,
            tender offer or proxy contest involving us more difficult, or could
            discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us,
            even if such a transaction were beneficial to the interest of our
            shareholders," "Business - Supervision and Regulation" and under
            Item 14 (Indemnification of Directors and Officers) in Part II of

            Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms
            of the Company's capital stock (including the Securities),

            encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its
            Subsidiaries pursuant to the charter or by-laws of the Company or

            under the heading "Certain Relationships and Related Party
            Transactions," the terms of any indenture, contract, lease,

            Securities by the Underwriters in the manner contemplated in this
            Agreement and in the Prospectus and such other approvals (specified
            in such opinion) as have been obtained;

                  (vii) the Registration Statement has become effective under
            the Act; any required filing of the Prospectus, and any supplements
            thereto, pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and
            within the time period required by Rule 424(b); to the knowledge of

            Statement and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements
            and other financial and statistical information contained therein,
            as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form

            that on the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained any
            untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material
            fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
            statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus as of its
            date and on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue
            statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material
            fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
            circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each
            case, other than the financial statements and other financial and
            statistical information contained therein, as to which such counsel
            need express no opinion);

            In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters
            involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the
            State of New York or the Federal laws of the United States, to the
            extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the
            opinion of Patricia Forsyth and (B) as to matters of fact, to the
            extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of
            the Company and public officials. References to the Prospectus in
            this paragraph (c) shall also include any supplements thereto at the
            Closing Date.

            (d) The Selling Stockholder shall have requested and caused Debra K.
      Crane, Esq., counsel for the Selling Stockholder, to have furnished to the
      Representatives their opinion dated the Closing Date and addressed to the
      Representatives, to the effect that:

                  (i) this Agreement and the lock-up agreement have been duly
            authorized, executed and delivered by the Selling Stockholder, and
            the Selling Stockholder has full legal right and authority to sell,
            transfer and deliver in the manner provided in this Agreement the
            Securities being sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder;

                  (ii) assuming that each Underwriter acquires its interest in
            the Securities it has purchased from the Selling Stockholder without
            notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of
            the UCC), each Underwriter that has purchased such Securities
            delivered on the Closing Date to The Depository Trust Company or
            other securities intermediary by making payment therefor as provided
            herein, and that has had such

            Securities credited to the securities account or accounts of such
            Underwriters maintained with The Depository Trust Company or such
            other securities intermediary will have acquired a security
            entitlement (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(17) of the UCC)
            to such Securities purchased by such Underwriter, and no action
            based on an adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of
            the UCC) may be asserted against such Underwriter with respect to
            such Securities;

                  (iii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any
            court or governmental agency or body is required for the
            consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the transactions
            contemplated herein, except such as may have been obtained under the
            Act and such as may be required under the blue sky laws of any
            jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the
            Securities by the Underwriters and such other approvals (specified
            in such opinion) as have been obtained; and

                  (iv) neither the sale of the Securities being sold by the
            Selling Stockholder nor the consummation of any other of the
            transactions herein contemplated by the Selling Stockholder or the
            fulfillment of the terms hereof by the Selling Stockholder will
            conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
            default under any law or the charter or Regulations of the Selling
            Stockholder or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or
            instrument known to such counsel and to which the Selling
            Stockholder is a party or bound, or any judgment, order or decree
            known to such counsel to be applicable to the Selling Stockholder of
            any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body
            or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Selling Stockholder.

            In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters
involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Ohio or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper
and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good
standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to
counsel for the Underwriters, and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they
deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Selling Stockholder
and public officials.

            (e) The Representatives shall have received from LeBoeuf, Lamb,
      Greene & MacRae, L.L.P., counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or
      opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives,
      with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Registration
      Statement, the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto filed
      after the date hereof) and other related matters as the Representatives
      may reasonably require, and the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall
      have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request
      for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

26
<PAGE>

            (f) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a
      certificate of the Company, signed on behalf of the Company and not in
      their personal capacity by the Chairman of the Board or the President and
      the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the
      Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have
      carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any
      supplements to the Prospectus and this Agreement and that:

                  (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this
            Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with
            the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has
            complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on
            its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing
            Date;

                  (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
            Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that
            purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge,
            threatened;

                  (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements
            included in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto
            filed after the date hereof), there has been no material adverse
            effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects,
            earnings, business or properties of the Company and its
            Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from
            transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth
            in or contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement
            thereto filed after the date hereof); and

                  (iv) no downgrading has occurred in the rating accorded to the
            financial strength or claims paying ability of the Company or any of
            the Insurance Subsidiaries by A.M. Best or any "nationally
            recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined
            by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; no
            downgrading has occurred in the rating according to the financial
            strength or claims paying ability of the Company or any of the
            Insurance Subsidiaries by Demotech; and no such organization has
            publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with
            possible negative implications, its rating of the financial strength
            or claims paying ability of the Company or any of the Insurance
            Subsidiaries.

            (g) The Selling Stockholder shall have furnished to the
      Representatives a certificate, signed by the Chief Executive Officer and
      the principal financial or accounting officer of the Selling Stockholder,
      dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the representations and
      warranties of the Selling Stockholder in this Agreement are true and
      correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date to the same
      effect as if made on the Closing Date.

            (h) The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche
      LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at
      the Closing Date, letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and
      as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the
      Representatives, confirming that they are an independent registered public
      accounting firm within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and
      regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and stating in effect
      that:

                  (i) in their opinion the audited consolidated financial
            statements and financial statement schedules included in the
            Registration Statement and the Prospectus and reported on by them
            comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
            accounting requirements of the Act and the related rules and
            regulations adopted by the Commission;

                  (ii) on the basis of certain specified procedures (but not an
            audit or a review in accordance with standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States)) which would not
            necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the
            comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the
            meetings of the board of directors of the Company and the
            Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who
            have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the
            Company and its Subsidiaries as to transactions and events
            subsequent to December 31, 2004, nothing came to their attention
            which caused them to believe that, with respect to the period
            subsequent to December 31, 2004, there were any changes, at a
            specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the
            letter, in the common stock of the Company or increase of long-term
            debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries as compared with the
            amounts shown on the December 31, 2004 audited balance sheet
            included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, or for
            the period from January 1, 2005 to such specified date there were
            any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the
            preceding year in net earned premiums of the Company and its
            Subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set
            forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied
            by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof
            unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the
            Representatives;

                  (iii) nothing came to their attention which caused them to
            believe that the information included in the Registration Statement
            and Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected
            Financial Data; other than the financial data with respect to fiscal
            year 2000), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information) and Item
            402 (Executive Compensation) is not in conformity with the
            applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; and

                  (iv) they have performed certain other specified procedures as
            a result of which they determined that certain information of an
            accounting,

28
<PAGE>

            financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting,
            financial or statistical information derived from the general
            accounting records of the Company and its Subsidiaries) set forth in
            the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, including the
            information set forth under the caption "Selected Historical
            Financial Data" (other than financial data with respect to fiscal
            year 2000) in the Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of
            the Company and its Subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal
            interpretation.

References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (h) include any supplement
   thereto at the date of the letter.

            (i) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of
      which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any
      amendment thereof) and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto
      filed after the date hereof), there shall not have been (i) any change or
      decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (h)
      of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a
      prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or
      otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its
      Subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in
      the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in
      the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto filed after the date
      hereof) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
      above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and
      adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the
      offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration
      Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Prospectus
      (exclusive of any supplement thereto filed after the date hereof).

            (j) Subsequent to the Execution Time, (A) there shall not have been
      any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any
      "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for
      purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended
      or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any
      such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change;
      and (B) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded to the
      financial strength or claims paying ability of the Company or any of the
      Insurance Subsidiaries by Demotech, A.M. Best or any "nationally
      recognized statistical rating organization" and no such organization shall
      have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with
      possible negative implications, its rating of the financial strength or
      claims paying ability of the Company or any of the Insurance Subsidiaries.

            (k) The Securities shall have been listed and admitted and
      authorized for trading on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to notice of
      issuance of the Securities, and reasonably satisfactory evidence of such
      actions shall have been provided to the Representatives.

29
<PAGE>

            (l) At the Execution Time, the Company shall have furnished to the
      Representatives a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto
      from each officer, director and 5% stockholder of the Company addressed to
      the Representatives; such letters shall be in force and effect as of the
      Execution Time and the Closing Date.

            (m) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such
      further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may
      reasonably request, including, without limitation, (i) a certificate
      signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company on behalf of the
      Company and not in his individual capacity confirming as of the time they
      were made the representations by the Company to Arthur Andersen LLP at the
      time of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
      and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2000, and (ii) a
      certificate signed by the Executive Vice President - Corporate Finance and
      Treasurer of the Company on behalf of the Company and not in his
      individual capacity as to (A) the consolidated financial statements of the
      Company and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2000, and (B)
      the statutory financial statements of Proformance for the years ended and
      as of December 31, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003
      and 2004.

            If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have
been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions
and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel
for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters
hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the
Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in
writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

            The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be
delivered at the office of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P., counsel for
the Underwriters, at 125 West 55th Street, New York, NY 10019, on the Closing
Date.

            ARTICLE VII Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of
the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to
the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not
satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because
of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or the Selling
Stockholder to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof
other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will
reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on
demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection
with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. If the Company is
required to make any payments to the Underwriters under this Section 7 because
of the Selling Stockholder's refusal, inability or failure to satisfy any
condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Sections 6(d) and
(g), the Selling Stockholder

30
<PAGE>

pro rata in proportion to the percentage of Securities to be sold shall
reimburse the Company on demand for all amounts so paid.

            ARTICLE VIII Indemnification and Contribution.

            (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Selling
      Stockholder and each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and
      agents of the Selling Stockholder and each Underwriter and each person who
      controls the Selling Stockholder and any Underwriter within the meaning of
      either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims,
      damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may
      become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state
      statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
      losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
      arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
      statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for
      the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment
      thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any
      amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon
      the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
      to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
      misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as
      incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
      connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
      liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be
      liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
      liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or
      alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in
      reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
      Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives
      specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in
      addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

            (b) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Citigroup
      Global Markets Inc., the directors, officers, employees and agents of
      Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and each person, who controls Citigroup
      Global Markets Inc. within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange
      Act ("Citigroup Entities"), from and against any and all losses, claims,
      damages and liabilities to which they may become subject under the Act,
      the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at
      common law or otherwise (including, without limitation, any legal or other
      expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating
      any such action or claim), insofar as such losses, claims damages or
      liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based
      upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
      contained in the prospectus wrapper material, if any, prepared by or with
      the consent of the Company for distribution in foreign jurisdictions in
      connection with the Directed Share Program attached to the Prospectus or
      any preliminary prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
      or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
      therein or necessary to make the

31
<PAGE>

      statement therein, when considered in conjunction with the Prospectus or
      any applicable preliminary prospectus, not misleading; (ii) caused by the
      failure of any Participant to pay for and accept delivery of the
      securities which immediately following the Effective Date of the
      Registration Statement, were subject to a properly confirmed agreement to
      purchase; or (iii) related to, arising out of, or in connection with the
      Directed Share Program, , except that this clause (iii) shall not apply to
      the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability is finally
      judicially determined to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence
      or willful misconduct of the Citigroup Entities.

            (c) The Selling Stockholder severally agrees to indemnify and hold
      harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who
      signs the Registration Statement, each Underwriter, the directors,
      officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who
      controls the Company or any Underwriter within the meaning of either the
      Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
      the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written
      information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Selling
      Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the
      foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
      liability which the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have.

            (d) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify
      and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers
      who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the
      Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and the
      Selling Stockholder, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each
      Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to
      such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such
      Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the
      documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement
      will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise
      have. The Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledge that the
      statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding
      delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan
      of Distribution," (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective
      participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to
      concessions and reallowances, (iii) the paragraph related to
      stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids, (iv) the
      paragraph relating to the availability of the Prospectus on the Internet
      and possible Internet distributions, and (v) the paragraph related to
      restrictions with respect to the underwriters' offering of the Securities
      in non-U.S. jurisdictions, in any Preliminary Prospectus and the
      Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on
      behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary
      Prospectus or the Prospectus.

            (e) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
      Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
      party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
      indemnifying party under this

32
<PAGE>

      Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
      thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not
      relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) above
      unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and
      such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of
      substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve
      the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other
      than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or
      (d) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of
      the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to
      represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is
      sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be
      responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by
      the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided,
      however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.
      Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to
      represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall
      have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and
      the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
      of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the
      indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such
      counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential
      defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified
      party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have
      reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it
      and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to
      those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party
      shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to
      represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of
      the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall
      authorize in writing the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at
      the expense of the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall not be
      liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
      consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment
      for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the
      indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
      settlement or judgment. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior
      written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or
      consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or
      threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
      indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not
      the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or
      action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
      unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising
      out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

            (f) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b),
      (c) or (d) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold
      harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Selling
      Stockholder and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate
      losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses
      reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same)
      (collectively "Losses") to which the

33
<PAGE>

      Company, the Selling Stockholder and one or more of the Underwriters may
      be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
      benefits received by the Company, by the Selling Stockholder and by the
      Underwriters from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that
      in no case shall (i) any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any
      agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities)
      be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or
      commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter
      hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
      sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Selling
      Stockholder and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is
      appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the
      relative fault of the Company, of the Selling Stockholder and of the
      Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted
      in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
      Benefits received by the Company and by the Selling Stockholder shall be
      deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before
      deducting expenses) received by each of them, and benefits received by the
      Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting
      discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of
      the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
      other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a
      material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
      relates to information provided by the Company, or the Selling Stockholder
      on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the
      parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and
      opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The
      Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would
      not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata
      allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account
      of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the
      provisions of this paragraph (f), no person guilty of fraudulent
      misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall
      be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
      fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person
      who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the
      Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an
      Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such
      Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning
      of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who
      shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the
      Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company; and
      each person who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the
      Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Selling Stockholder and each
      director of the Selling Stockholder shall have the same rights to
      contribution as the Selling Stockholder, subject in each case to the
      applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (f).

            (g) The liability of the Selling Stockholder under the Selling
      Stockholder's representations and warranties contained in Section 1 hereof
      and under the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
      Section 8 shall be limited to an amount equal to the initial public
      offering price of the Securities

34
<PAGE>

      sold by the Selling Stockholder to the Underwriters. The Company and the
      Selling Stockholder may agree, as among themselves and without limiting
      the rights of the Underwriters under this Agreement, as to the respective
      amounts of such liability for which they each shall be responsible.

            ARTICLE IX Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more
Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to
be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to
purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their
obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated
severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount
of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the
aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining
Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the
aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of
Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have
the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase
any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase
all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any
nondefaulting Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company. In the event
of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date
shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the
Representatives and the Company jointly shall determine in order that the
required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any
other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to
the Company, the Selling Stockholder and any nondefaulting Underwriter for
damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

            ARTICLE X Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to
termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given
to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any
time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have
been suspended by the Commission or the Nasdaq National Market or trading in
securities generally on the Nasdaq National Market or the New York Stock
Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been
established on the Nasdaq National Market or the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) a
banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State
authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of
hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or
other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to
make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable
to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by
the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto filed after the date
hereof).

            ARTICLE XI Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The
respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other
statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in
or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or

35
<PAGE>

on behalf of any Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company or any of
the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in
Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or
cancellation of this Agreement.

            ARTICLE XII Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing
and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be
mailed, delivered or telefaxed to the Citigroup Global Markets Inc. General
Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) with a confirming copy sent to the General

with a confirming copy sent to The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, at 9450
Seward Road, Fairfield, Ohio 45014, attention of the General Counsel.

            ARTICLE XIII Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the
officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in
Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation
hereunder.

            ARTICLE XIV Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York.

            ARTICLE XV Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more

                         Public Offering of Common Stock

                                                          _______ __, 2004

Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
As Representative of the several Underwriters,
c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
388 Greenwich Street
New York, New York  10013
Ladies and Gentlemen:

            This letter is being delivered to you in connection with the
proposed Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between National
Atlantic Holdings Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), The
Ohio Casualty Insurance Company as selling shareholder, and you as
representative of a group of Underwriters named therein, relating to an
underwritten public offering of Common Stock, no par value per share (the
"Common Stock"), of the Company.

            In order to induce you and the other Underwriters to enter into the
Underwriting Agreement, the undersigned will not, without the prior written
consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., (a) offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, (b) enter into any transaction which is designed
to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by
actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or
otherwise) by the undersigned or any affiliate of the undersigned or any person
in privity with the undersigned with respect to any shares of Common Stock or
any affiliate of the undersigned, directly or indirectly or in the filing of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in respect
of, or (c) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or
decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder with respect to,
any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible into,
or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, or publicly announce an
intention to effect any such transaction, for a period of 180 days after the
date of the Underwriting Agreement.

<PAGE>

            Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) if the undersigned is a
partnership, the partnership may transfer shares of capital stock (or any
securities convertible into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for capital stock)
to a partner of such partnership or by operation of law; (b) if the undersigned
is an individual, he or she may transfer shares of capital stock (or any
securities convertible into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for capital stock)
by gift, will, or intestate succession; and (c) the undersigned may transfer any
shares of capital stock (or any securities convertible into, exercisable for, or
exchangeable for capital stock) to an affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule
3b-18 of the regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange
Act")) of the undersigned; provided, however, that in any such case it shall be
a condition to the transfer that (i) each transferee execute an agreement
stating that the transferee is receiving and holding the shares of capital stock
(or any securities convertible into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for
capital stock) subject to the provisions of this Lock-Up Agreement, and there
shall be no further transfer of such shares of capital stock (or any securities
convertible into, exercisable for, or exchangeable for capital stock) except in
