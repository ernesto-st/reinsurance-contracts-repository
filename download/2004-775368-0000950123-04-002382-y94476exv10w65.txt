Seller and Parent, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to

                  3.1      Organization and Standing.

                  (a)      Each of Seller, Parent and the Company is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction, and each of Seller, Parent and the Company has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
Properties (including, without limitation, the Stock) and to conduct its
business as currently being conducted. The Company is duly qualified, licensed
to conduct business, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction set forth in
Schedule 3.1(b), except as noted thereon.

                  (b)      Schedule 3.1(b) is an accurate and complete list of
each Insurance Permit held by the Company and sets forth the scheduled
expiration date of each such Insurance Permit. True, correct and complete copies
of all of such Insurance Permits (as of a recent date) are attached to Schedule
3.1(b). Except as limited by state statute generally applicable to all companies
of a similar type as the Company or as set forth in such Schedule, the Company's
authority to write the lines and classes of insurance set forth on such Schedule
is unrestricted and the Company is not a party to any agreement or arrangement
with any regulatory official or agency limiting or restricting the Company's
ability to make full use of the Insurance Permits. Except as set forth in

withdrawn, modified, restricted or conditioned in any respect by a state
insurance regulatory authority, and no application for an Insurance Permit filed
by the Company within the last 12 months has been denied or withdrawn. No event
has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, suspension, lapse or
limitation of any Insurance Permit. The Company is not transacting and has not
transacted any insurance business in any jurisdiction requiring an Insurance
Permit or qualification in which it did not possess such Insurance Permit or
qualification.

                  (c)      Schedule 3.1(c) identifies each director and
executive officer of the Company as currently in effect and contains true and
correct copies of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws,
including all amendments thereto through, and as in effect on, the date hereof.

                  3.2      Authorization of Agreement. Each of Seller and Parent
has all requisite power to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action on the

Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder, and the execution, delivery
and performance of the

<PAGE>

Assignment and the Commutation Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
requisite action on the part of each of Parent and the Company. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of Seller and Parent and is the
valid and binding obligation of each of Seller and Parent enforceable against
each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy Exception.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Assignment and the Commutation Agreement will

stock of the Company consists of 10,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par
value per share, of which only the Stock (consisting of 3,500,000 shares of such

Stock are duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable.
Seller is the lawful owner, beneficially and of record, of all of the Stock and
has good and valid title to the Stock, free and clear of all Liens or
Restrictions, voting trusts or other voting agreements, contracts, calls,
commitments of any kind, including any such agreement, arrangement, commitment
or understanding restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend
rights or dispositions of the Stock. Upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser will acquire record and beneficial
ownership of the Stock, free and clear of any Liens or Restrictions, voting
trusts or other voting agreements, contracts, calls, commitments of any kind,
including any such agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding
restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or dispositions
of the Stock.

outstanding options, convertible securities, warrants or other rights to
subscribe for or purchase from Seller or the Company, and there are no plans,
contracts or commitments for the granting by Seller or the Company of rights to
acquire: (i) any capital stock or other ownership interests in the Company
including the Stock; or (ii) any securities convertible into or exchangeable for
any such capital stock or ownership interests in the Company.

                  3.5      Financial Statements. Seller has delivered to

Financial Statements fairly represent the financial position and the results of
operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods to which such

results of operations of the Company during the last 12 months that has had, or
could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has

                           sent; (6) each Assumption Agreement and the other
                           documents required to be executed and delivered in

         the business of Seller, Parent or the Company.

                  (ii)     Until the Closing Date, Purchaser shall hold any

right to review the Tax Return and schedule received from Purchaser pursuant to
the terms of this Section 5.3(e). Seller and Purchaser agree to consult each
other and resolve in good faith any issues arising under the terms of this
Section 5.3(e) as a result of the review of any such Tax Return and schedule
received from Purchaser and the amount of Tax, if any, due from Seller shall be
paid by Seller to Purchaser no later than two (2) days prior to the date of
filing of such Tax Return or the amount

                                       19
<PAGE>

of Tax due, if any, from Purchaser to Seller shall be paid by Purchaser to
Seller no later than three (3) days after the date of filing of such Tax Return.

                  (f)      Seller shall cause any Tax sharing agreement or
similar arrangement with respect to Taxes involving the Company, on the one
hand, and Seller, or any Affiliates of Seller, on the other hand, to be
terminated effective as of the Closing Date, so that to the extent any such
agreement or arrangement relates to the Company after the Closing Date, none of
the Company, Seller, nor its Affiliates shall have any obligation thereunder to
the other, whether to make payment or otherwise, under any such agreement or
arrangement for any past, present or future period.

                  (g)      Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, from the date hereof to and including the Closing Date, Seller,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser will not permit the Company to
directly or indirectly (i) make, change or revoke, or permit to be made, changed
or revoked, any election or method of accounting, with respect to Taxes
affecting the Company for Post-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) enter into, or permit
to be entered into, any closing or other agreement or settlement with respect to
Taxes of the Company affecting or relating to Post-Closing Tax Periods, or (iii)
enter into any transaction or series of transactions other than in the ordinary
course of business, or take any position on any Tax Return for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date that would
have the effect of increasing the Company's tax liability for any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

                  (h)      If (i) Seller receives a written notice from any
Taxing Authority proposing an audit or other examination of a Tax Return of the
Company for any Pre-Closing Period or (ii) a claim is made or threatened in
writing by any Taxing Authority that, if successful, may result in an indemnity
payment under Section 5.4(a) hereof (each a "Tax Claim"), Purchaser shall
promptly notify Seller in writing stating the nature and basis of such Tax
Claim, and the amount thereof, to the extent known. Failure to give such notice
shall not relieve Seller from any liability that it may have on account of this
indemnification or otherwise, unless and to the extent that Seller is materially
adversely prejudiced thereby. Seller will have the right, upon notification to
Purchaser within thirty (30) days of the date Purchaser notified Seller of such
Tax Claim, to assume at its own expense the control of any audit or other
defense of any Tax Claim with its own counsel. If Seller elects not to control
any audit or other defense of a Tax Claim, Purchaser shall have the authority to
settle without Seller's consent such Tax Claim. Seller's right to control a Tax
Claim will be limited to issues in respect of which amounts in dispute would be
paid by Seller or for which Seller would be liable pursuant to Section 5.4(a)
hereof. Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with Seller in contesting any
Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include providing records and information
that are reasonably available to the Company and relevant to such Tax Claim. All
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Purchaser related to such cooperation shall
be borne by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Seller shall not have the
right to control any issue involved in a Tax Claim unless Seller first
acknowledges in writing its obligation to fully indemnify Purchaser for the
Taxes asserted in connection with such issue; (ii) no settlement or disposition
of any Tax Claim shall be made without Purchaser's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and (iii) Purchaser and Seller
shall jointly control all proceedings involving any claims for Taxes

                                       20
<PAGE>

assessed in respect of a Straddle Period, and each party shall bear its own
out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to such claims.

                  (i)      Seller, Purchaser and the Company agree that for all
income Tax purposes, the taxable period of the Company shall be terminated as of
the close of business on the date of the Closing in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1) (other than transactions properly allocable
thereunder to the portion of the day after the Closing shall occur) and items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit shall be apportioned based upon a
closing of the books for Tax purposes in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b). No elections shall be made under either Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable allocation of a
year's items) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) (to ratably
allocate the items for the month which includes the Closing Date). Seller,
Purchaser and the Company further agree to file all Tax Returns, handle the
contest of any audit and otherwise act for all Tax purposes consistent with the
provisions of this Section 5.3(i).

                  5.4      Indemnifications, Assumptions of Liability and
Related Matters.

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(e), (f) and
(g) and 5.5(b) hereof, Parent and Seller, jointly and severally, shall pay and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, Transferee and the Company from:
(i) all liability of the Company for Taxes (other than any Tax constituting a
part of the 2004 Filing Fees) assessed in respect of, and all costs and expenses
of Tax audits or the preparation of Tax Returns for, all Pre-Closing Periods,
and the Seller's portion of any Straddle Period; (ii) all liability resulting by
reason of the several liability of the Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law or regulation or
by reason of the Company having been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date; (iii) all liability of the Company in respect of Taxes of any
other Person or entity pursuant to any agreement or contract, whether written or
unwritten, entered into on or before the Closing Date, or as a transferor or
successor, by contract or otherwise; and (iv) all liability arising as a result
of a breach of the representations provided in Section 3.7 hereof, or the
failure of Seller to perform its obligations pursuant to Section 5.3 or Section
5.6 hereof. In the case of any Straddle Period, Parent and Seller shall be
solely responsible for all Taxes (other than any Tax constituting a part of the
2004 Filing Fees) of the Company (and that portion of the Company's costs for
the preparation of each such Tax Return and Tax Audits) attributable to the
portion of the period ending on, and that includes, the Closing Date, and
Purchaser shall be solely responsible and shall indemnify Seller for all Taxes
imposed on the income or operations of the Company and attributable to the
portion of the period beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, the portion of any Tax (other than any Tax constituting a part of the
2004 Filing Fees) that is attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period up to
and including the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is not
based on gross or net income, premiums, sales or gross receipts (including real
property taxes), the total amount of such Tax for the period in question
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case
of any Tax that is based on any of gross income, premiums, sales or gross
receipts, the Tax that would be due with respect to the portion of the Straddle
Period through and including the Closing Date, if such portion of the Straddle
Period were a separate taxable period, except that exemptions, allowances,
deductions,

                                       21
<PAGE>

credits or graduated rates that are calculated or applied on an annual basis
(such as the deduction for depreciation or capital allowances) shall be
apportioned on the basis of the gross income, premiums, sales or gross receipts
for each such period, or if not based upon such gross income, premiums, sales or
gross receipts, then on a per diem basis.

                  (b)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(e) and (g)
hereof, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, Transferee and the Company from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, guaranty fund assessment or similar
obligation, costs, expenses (together with reasonable attorneys' fees and all
costs and expenses of enforcing such right of indemnification against Parent),
Taxes and penalties, if any, arising out of or based upon the employment of any
individual or entity or arising with respect to or out of any Employee Benefit
Plan including, without limitation, any liability: (i) to the PBGC or any other
person under Title IV of ERISA; (ii) with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under
Title IV of ERISA; (iii) with respect to any notice and benefit continuation
requirements of COBRA; (iv) with respect to any noncompliance with ERISA or any
other applicable laws, or with the terms of the Employee Benefit Plan; (v) any
excise tax imposed under Sections 4971 through 4980F of the Code; (vi) with
respect to any failure to make any contribution to the Employee Benefit Plan;
and (vii) with respect to any suit, proceeding or claim which is brought against
the Company, its officers or directors, any Employee Benefit Plan or any
fiduciary or former fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan; provided, however,
that Parent's obligation to indemnify Purchaser, Transferee and the Company
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.4(b) shall not apply to any loss,
claim, damage, liability, guaranty fund assessment or similar obligation, cost
or expense (together with reasonable attorneys' fees and all costs and expenses
of enforcing such right of indemnification) which (A) relates to any individual
or entity that was not employed by, and performed no services for, the Company
prior to the Closing Date; (B) is based upon or arose out of an act taken by or
omission by the Company, Transferee or Purchaser with respect to an event
occurring after the Closing Date which event has no connection, directly or
indirectly, with any Employee Benefit Plan or employment arrangement for which
the Company had (prior to the Closing Date), or a pre-Closing ERISA Affiliate
had, an obligation or potential obligation; or (C) is based upon or arose out of
any employee benefit plan which was not maintained by the Company or a
pre-Closing ERISA Affiliate prior to the Closing Date, or with respect to which
neither the Company nor any pre-Closing ERISA Affiliate had any obligations
which arose before the Closing Date. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller to the same extent as Parent's indemnity of Purchaser set forth in this
Section 5.4(b) with respect to the matters described in clauses (A), (B) and (C)
of this proviso.

                  (c)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(e), (f) and
(g) and 5.5(b) hereof, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless Purchaser, Transferee and the Company and their respective
directors, officers and employees (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees")
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, guaranty fund
assessments or similar obligations, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and all costs and expenses of enforcing such right of
indemnification against Parent) and penalties, if any (collectively, the
"Purchaser Losses"), arising out of, based upon or with respect to: (i) any
breach of or failure by Seller, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to
perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or undertakings to be
performed or complied with by any of them under the Company Reinsurance
Agreements, the Parent

                                       22
<PAGE>

Reinsurance Agreement, the Assignment or the Commutation Agreement; (ii) any
breach of or failure by Seller, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to
perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or undertakings to be
performed or complied with by any of them under this Agreement; (iii) any breach
of any representation or warranty made by Seller or Parent in this Agreement or
in any certificate, instrument or other documentation delivered pursuant hereto;
and (iv) any liability of the Company (whether known or unknown at the time of
execution of this Agreement) based on or arising out of any act, omission or
event occurring prior to the Closing.

                  (d)      Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(e), (f) and
(g) hereof, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and Seller and their respective directors, officers and
employees (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, guaranty fund assessments or similar
obligations, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and all costs
and expenses of enforcing such right of indemnification against Purchaser) and
penalties, if any (collectively, the "Seller Losses"), arising out of, based
upon or with respect to: (i) any breach of or failure by Purchaser to perform or
comply with any of the covenants, agreements or undertakings to be performed or
complied with by Purchaser under this Agreement; (ii) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement; (iii) any
liability of the Company (other than any liability for which Parent is obligated
to indemnify Purchaser, Transferee and the Company under this Section 5.4) based
on or arising out of any act, omission or event occurring after the Closing; and
(iv) all liability of the Company for Taxes assessed in respect of all taxable
periods beginning after the Closing Date.

                  (e)      For the purposes of administering the indemnification
provisions of this Section 5.4 (except for any Tax Claim subject to Section
5.3(h) hereof), the following procedures shall apply from and after the Closing
Date:

                  (i)      An indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor of
         any Indemnification Event reasonably promptly following (A) the receipt
         of notice by the indemnified party of the commencement of any action or
         proceeding, (B) such indemnified party becoming aware of the assertion
         of any claim against such indemnified party, or (C) the discovery by
         such indemnified party of any loss giving rise to indemnity pursuant to
         this Section 5.4. Such notification shall indicate whether such
         indemnified party is requesting indemnification with respect to such
         Indemnification Event and the amount of indemnification initially
         anticipated. The failure to notify the Indemnitor of any
         Indemnification Event shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnity
         obligation, unless and to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially
         and actually prejudiced thereby.

                  (ii)     After notification is given as required by Section
         5.4(e)(i) of this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall be entitled (but is
         not obligated) to assume the defense or settlement of any such action
         or proceeding, or to participate in any negotiations or proceedings to
         settle or otherwise eliminate any claim. Any indemnified party is
         hereby authorized prior to the date on which it receives written notice
         from the Indemnitor that the Indemnitor intends to assume the defense,
         settlement or other disposition of such action or proceeding, to file
         any motion, answer or other pleading and to take such other

                                       23
<PAGE>

         action which the indemnified party shall reasonably deem necessary to
         protect its interest or that of the Indemnitor until the date on which
         the indemnified party receives such notice from the Indemnitor,
         provided that, prior to filing such motion, answer or other pleading or
         taking such other action, the indemnified party shall have made
         reasonable efforts to consult with the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor
         fails to confirm in writing within one month of the date of the
         notification referred to above that the Indemnitor will assume the
         defense, the indemnified party may engage counsel to defend, settle or
         otherwise dispose of such action or proceeding, and in such event the
         indemnified party shall pursue the defense or settlement of any such
         action or proceeding in good faith and the Indemnitor shall remain
         liable and responsible for all losses in connection therewith,
         including the indemnified party's costs, attorneys' fees and expenses,
         all as and when incurred by such indemnified party.

                  (iii)    In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense
         or settlement with respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor
         shall be entitled to assume such defense or settlement with counsel of
         its own choosing, provided that (except with respect to Tax audits
         subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(h) of this Agreement): (A) the
         indemnified party (and its counsel) shall be entitled to continue to
         participate at its own cost in any such action or proceeding or in any
         negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any claim
         for which indemnification is being sought (it being understood that the
         Indemnitor shall be entitled to make all final determinations with
         respect to the defense or (subject to clause (B) hereof) settlement of
         such action, proceeding or claim); and (B) unless the settlement of an
         action, proceeding or claim involves only the payment of dollar damages
         (all of which are to be paid by the Indemnitor), the Indemnitor shall
         not be entitled to settle, compromise, decline to appeal, or otherwise
         dispose of any such action, proceeding or claim without the consent or
         agreement of the indemnified party (which consent will not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed).

                  (iv)     In any case where an Indemnitor shall have assumed
         the defense or settlement of any action, proceeding or claim and the
         indemnified party is entitled to continue to participate in such
         action, proceeding or claim, and shall have elected to do so, it shall
         do so at its own expense. In no event shall an Indemnitor be liable to
         any indemnified party for the cost of employing or using in-house legal
         counsel regardless of whether such Indemnitor has, or has not, assumed
         the defense or settlement of such action, proceeding or claim.

                  (v)      In the event indemnification is requested, the
         Indemnitor, its representatives and agents shall have reasonable access
         to the books, records and other Documents of the indemnified party or
         parties seeking such indemnification to the extent reasonably requested
         by the Indemnitor in connection with the Indemnitor's defense or
         settlement of any action, proceeding or claim; provided, however, that
         such access shall be provided upon reasonable prior notice, during
         normal business hours and in such manner as not to interfere
         unreasonably with the operation of the business of the indemnified
         party or parties and shall only take place in the presence of a
         representative of the indemnified party or parties unless otherwise so
         agreed; and provided, further, that the indemnified party shall not be
         required to disclose any information with respect to

                                       24
<PAGE>

         itself or any of its Affiliates (or former Affiliates), other than the
         Company, and shall not be required to participate in the defense of any
         action, proceeding or claim to be indemnified under this Agreement
         (except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement), unless
         such disclosure or participation is required or reasonably necessary in
         the defense of any action, proceeding or claim to be indemnified under
         this Agreement, in which case the indemnified party shall be fully
         reimbursed for the reasonable costs of such participation.

                  (vi)     From the date of this Agreement, each party agrees
         that, except as provided below, it shall retain all Documents with
         respect to all material matters pertaining to the Company (except to
         the extent that such Documents in the possession of Seller at the
         Closing and relating to the Company may be transferred at the Closing
         to the possession of Purchaser or the Company). Before disposing of or
         otherwise destroying any such Documents, the possessor thereof shall
         give reasonable notice to such effect and deliver to the other party,
         at the other party's expense and upon its request, a copy of any such
         Documents. In addition, each party to this Agreement agrees to use its
         best efforts to cause its employees (and in the case of Purchaser, the
         employees of the Company) to cooperate with and assist the other party
         in connection with any claim, action or proceeding for which indemnity
         is sought under this Agreement or with respect to which either party
         has elected to participate in the defense.

                  (vii)    Following payment by an indemnified party of any
         amount for which it is entitled to indemnity, the indemnified party may
         demand in writing that the Indemnitor reimburse the indemnified party
         for such payment. Such written demand shall set forth the basis and
         amount of such payment in reasonable detail and include a copy of any
         supporting invoice, demand(s) against which payment(s) were made and
         all supporting documentation. If reimbursement is not made by the
         Indemnitor within 30 calendar days of receipt by the Indemnitor of such
         demand for which the parties agree the Indemnitor is liable, interest
         shall thereafter accrue and be payable on the amount to which the
         indemnified party is entitled at a rate equal to 6% per annum until
         paid; provided however, if the Indemnitor disputes the amount demanded
         or the basis for indemnification or disputes that the party seeking
         indemnification is entitled thereto, and fails to pay all amounts due
         within 30 days after a final determination is made in favor of the
         indemnified party, interest shall be payable from and after the 31st
         day after such final determination at a rate equal to 10% per annum. If
         an amount paid by the Indemnitor pursuant to this Section 5.4 is
         finally determined not to have been due from the Indemnitor, the
         indemnified party shall return the amount so paid together with
         interest at a rate of 6% per annum from the date payment was made by
         the Indemnitor until the 30th day after such final determination, and
         at a rate of 10% per annum thereafter, until the date such payment is
         received by the Indemnitor.

                  (f)      (i)     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
         the contrary, for purposes of the indemnification provisions set forth
         in this Article V, all Material Adverse Effect, materiality and
         correlative qualifications included in any of the representations and
         warranties contained in this Agreement shall be disregarded (including
         for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and for
         purposes of

                                       25
<PAGE>


         determining the amount of Purchaser Losses or Seller Losses, as the
         case may be, associated with a breach).

                  (ii)     Subject to Section 5.4(f)(iii) below, Parent shall
         not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section
         5.4(c)(iii) for any breach of any of the representations or warranties
         made by Seller or Parent until such time as the total amount of the
         Purchaser Losses (including the Purchaser Losses arising from such
         breach and all other Purchaser Losses arising from any other breaches
         of the same representation or warranty or any other representation or
         warranty) that have been suffered or incurred by the Purchaser
         Indemnitees exceeds $50,000 in the aggregate. At such time as the total
         amount of such Purchaser Losses exceeds $50,000 in the aggregate, the
         Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against the
         full amount of such Purchaser Losses (and not merely the portion of
         such Purchaser Losses exceeding $50,000).

                  (iii)    The limitation on Parent's indemnification
         obligations that is set forth in Section 5.4(f)(ii) above shall not
         apply to any breach of any of the representation and warranties set
         forth in Section 3.3 (Capital Stock of the Company), Section 3.4
         (Interests in Securities of the Company), Section 3.7 (Tax Returns and
         Reports), Section 3.12 (Form of Capital and Surplus), Section 3.15
         (Employee Matters) and Section 3.18 (Brokers and Finders).

                  (iv)     Subject to Section 5.4(f)(v) below, Purchaser shall
         not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section
         5.4(d)(ii) for any breach of any of the representations or warranties
         made by Purchaser until such time as the total amount of the Seller
         Losses (including the Seller Losses arising from such breach and all
         other Seller Losses arising from any other breaches of the same
         representation or warranty or any other representation or warranty)
         that have been suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds
         $50,000 in the aggregate. At such time as the total amount of such
         Seller Losses exceeds $50,000 in the aggregate, the Seller Indemnitees
         shall be entitled to be indemnified against the full amount of such
         Seller Losses (and not merely the portion of such Seller Losses
         exceeding $50,000).

                  (v)      The limitation on Purchaser's indemnification
         obligations that is set forth in Section 5.4(f)(iv) above shall not

                  5.5      Closing Date Statement of Assets and Closing Date
Balance Sheet.

                  (a)      Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in the
preparation of the Closing Date Statement of Assets. The Closing Date Statement
of Assets shall be prepared as of the close of business on the business day
immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall set forth the value of all
tangible assets of the Company (other than deferred Tax assets). Assets included
on the Closing Date Statement of Assets shall be valued as follows: (i) cash and
cash equivalents shall be valued at face value and (ii) investment securities
traded in a recognized public market shall be valued at their closing composite
price as reported by Bloomberg LP or, if such values are not reported by
Bloomberg LP, for the preceding business day as reported by the Wall Street
Journal (if there is no closing price, then the average bid and asked prices
shall be used); provided, however, that if the investment security is quoted
only on a yield or discount rate basis, then such security shall be valued at
the price calculated in accordance with generally accepted financial practice
for the mean of the quoted bid and asked yield or rate. Seller shall prepare the
Closing Date Balance Sheet reflecting the Closing Date Shareholder's Equity
based upon the Closing Date Statement of Assets, and shall deliver the Closing
Date Statement of Assets and the Closing Date Balance Sheet reflecting the
Closing Date Shareholder's Equity to Purchaser no later than 6:00 p.m. on the
business day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

                  (b)      The parties agree that Filing Fees for the year
ending December 31, 2004 ("2004 Filing Fees") shall be allocated between the
Seller and Purchaser in accordance with this Section 5.5(b) and that such
allocation shall be binding on the parties for purposes of calculating the
Purchase Price regardless of the actual amount of the 2004 Filing Fees and
regardless of when such 2004 Filing Fees are actually paid. First, the parties
hereto stipulate and agree that the total amount used to calculate 2004 Filing
Fees for purposes of this Section 5.5(b) shall be the aggregate amount of 2003
Filing fees as shown on Schedule 3.8(b). Next, it is agreed that one-fourth of
such Filing Fee shall be chargeable to the Seller and three-fourths of such
Filing Fees shall be chargeable to the Purchaser as follows: From the amount
equal to one-fourth of the 2004 Filing Fees shall be deducted all amounts
actually paid by the Company prior to the Closing Date. If the resulting balance
is less than zero, such negative balance shall considered a prepaid expense and
shall be shown as an asset on the Closing Date Balance Sheet. If the resulting
balance is positive, such amount shall be shown as an accrued unpaid expense on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet. No other accrued unpaid or prepaid expense shall
be shown on the Closing Date Balance Sheet for 2004 Filing Fees. The foregoing
adjustments shall constitute complete settlement and discharge amount the
parties with respect to the 2004 Filing Fees and the indemnification obligation
set forth in Section 5.4 shall not apply with regard to any 2004 Filing Fees,
provided, nothing in this Section 5.5(b) shall relieve Seller from any
obligation as otherwise set froth in this Agreement resulting from a breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.8(b).

                  5.6      Transfer Taxes. Seller shall cause all appropriate
stock transfer Tax stamps to be affixed to the certificate or certificates
representing the Stock. Seller, the Company and Purchaser shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, applications or other
documents regarding any real property transfer, transfer gains or other similar
transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with the sale of the Stock
(other than the stock transfer taxes mentioned above) pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). Any Transfer Taxes shown as due on such
returns shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.

                                       27

                  5.7      Conduct of Business by Purchaser. Purchaser covenants
that it shall not, and it shall not permit the Company to, take any action that
would cause the Company to incur any liability whatsoever until the day
following the Closing Date including, without limitation, the commencement of
operations by the Company, the hiring of employees or insurance agents for the
Company, the writing of any insurance business by the Company or engaging in any
reinsurance or other business by the Company, amending or modifying any
governing document of the Company or the taking of any other action whatsoever
which obligates the Company to act or omit to act.

                  5.8      Change of Name. As promptly as practicable after the
Closing, the Company shall change its name so that the Company does not have the
word "Aegis" in its name, and the Company shall cease using the word "Aegis" in
any of its business dealings.

                  5.9      Disclosure of Confidential Information. Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective officers and
directors not to, disclose any Confidential Information after the date hereof to
any third party, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative
process or, in the opinion of its counsel, by other requirements of law. It is
acknowledged and agreed that unauthorized use of any Confidential Information
would cause irreparable injury constituting the proper subject of injunctive
relief and specific performance, in addition to providing Purchaser an action
for damages.

                  5.10     Compliance with Delaware Insurance Laws. During the
period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause
the Company to, comply with all of the requirements of Delaware insurance laws.

                  5.11     Notification of Changes.

                  (a)      Seller and/or Parent, as the case may be, shall,
after the first notice or occurrence thereof but not later than the Closing
Date, promptly notify Purchaser in writing of any event or the existence of any
state of facts that would (i) make any of its representations and warranties in
this Agreement untrue or (ii) reasonably be likely to constitute a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Purchaser shall, after the first notice or occurrence
thereof but not later than the Closing Date, promptly notify Seller in writing
of any event or the existence of any state of facts that would (i) make any of
its representations and warranties in this Agreement untrue or (ii) materially
impair the ability of Purchaser to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

                  5.12     Acquisition Proposals. From the date hereof through
the Closing Date, neither Seller nor Parent shall, nor shall Seller or Parent
permit any of their respective Affiliates or any of the officers, directors,
employees, representative or agents of Seller, Parent or any of such Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, to solicit, initiate or participate in any way in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information or assistance to,
or enter into any agreement with, any person or group of persons (other than
Purchaser) concerning any acquisition of a substantial equity interest in, or in
a merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution, or disposition of assets of
the Company, or any disposition of any of the securities of the Company (other
than sales of

                                       28
<PAGE>

investment securities in its investment portfolio with the prior written consent
of Purchaser) (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"), or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other person to do or seek
to do any of the foregoing. Seller and/or Parent, as the case may be, shall
promptly communicate to Purchaser the terms of any Acquisition Proposal which it
or any such other person may receive.

                  5.13     Assignment. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Company to, execute and deliver the Assignment.

                  5.14     Commutation Agreement. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to, execute and deliver the
Commutation Agreement.

                  5.15     Payment of Brokers' or Finders' Fees. At the Closing,
(i) Purchaser will pay the finder's fee due to Merger & Acquisition Services,
Inc., and (ii) Seller will reimburse Purchaser for one-half of the finder's fee
payable to Merger & Acquisition Services, Inc.; provided, however, that the
amount of such reimbursement payment by Seller shall not exceed $50,000.

                  5.16     Preparation of Statutory Financial Statements. With
respect to any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which Statutory
Financial Statements are required to be filed, Seller shall prepare, on a basis
consistent with past practices, all Statutory Financial Statements of the
Company, and Seller shall promptly provide to Purchaser, at least fifteen (15)
business days prior to the due date, including any extensions, for the filing
thereof, such Statutory Financial Statements together with such other
information reasonably relevant to such Statutory Financial Statements,
including schedules and work papers. Following receipt of any Statutory
Financial Statements prepared by Seller, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller
if it disputes any of the information contained in such Statutory Financial
Statements. The parties shall cooperate to promptly resolve any such dispute.
During a transitional period not to exceed six months following the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with such assistance in the preparation of
Statutory Financial Statements of the Company as may reasonably be requested by
Purchaser or the Company.

nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of any of
its covenants or agreements or willful breach of its representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement prior to termination of this Agreement or
any obligations hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                      TERMINATION OF OBLIGATIONS AND WAIVER
                       OF CONDITIONS; PAYMENT OF EXPENSES

                  In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant
to Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement, all further obligations of the parties
under this Agreement shall terminate without further liability of either Parent
and Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, to the other, and
each party will pay all of its own costs and expenses incident to the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance of, and
compliance with,

                                       34
<PAGE>

all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement on its part to be
performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of
counsel, provided that the obligations of the parties under Section 8.3 and the
obligations of Purchaser under Section 5.1(a)(ii) shall survive any such
termination. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3(b) or Section
6.3(c) shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies available to each
of Parent and Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, under
applicable law, including the right to recover all expenses, costs and other
damages, but no party shall be entitled to incidental or consequential damages
including loss of anticipated profits. If any of the conditions specified in
Section 6.1 have not been satisfied, Purchaser may, nevertheless, at its
election waive such conditions in writing and proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any of the conditions specified in Section
6.2 have not been satisfied, Parent and Seller may, nevertheless, at their
election waive such conditions in writing and proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated, each party will pay all of its own costs and
expenses in connection therewith.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                     GENERAL

                  8.1      Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented except upon execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived in writing at any
time by or on behalf of the party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be
binding only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
or shall constitute a waiver of such provision, and no waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of
any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver.

                  8.2      Integrated Contract. This Agreement and the Schedules
and Exhibits to this Agreement (which constitute part of this Agreement) and the
other documents and writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto
(including, without limitation, the Company Agreements, the Assignment and the
Commutation Agreement) contain the entire understanding of the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

                  8.3      Publicity. From the date hereof until the Closing
Date, the parties will consult with each other and will mutually agree by
written consent upon any publication or press release of any nature with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld) and shall not issue any such publication or press
release prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
securities exchange or any securities exchange regulation, in which case the
party proposing to issue such publication or

                                       35
<PAGE>

press release shall use reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the
other party before issuing any such publication or press release.

                  8.4      Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations
between the parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles regarding the
choice of law.

                  8.5      Jurisdiction. (a) The parties hereto hereby consent
and agree that they shall commence any action with respect to any claims or
disputes between or among the parties hereto pertaining to this Agreement, the
Company Agreements, the Assignment or the Commutation Agreement or to any matter
arising out of or related to such agreements in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, so long as the action falls within the
subject matter jurisdiction of such court; in the event any such action shall be
determined by the court to be outside its subject matter jurisdiction, then the
parties agree to commence any such action in the state courts of New York
located in New York County. The parties hereto expressly submit and consent in
advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in any such court,
and hereby waive any objection which it may have based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens and hereby consent to the
granting for such legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by such
court. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to it at its address given
pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof. Subject to the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed or operate to affect the right of Purchaser, Seller or
Parent to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law, or to
preclude the enforcement by Purchaser, Seller or Parent of any judgment or order
obtained in the forum specified in this subsection or the taking of any action
under this Agreement, the Company Agreements, the Assignment or the Commutation
Agreement to enforce the same in any other appropriate forum or jurisdiction.

                  (b)      To the extent that Purchaser, Seller or Parent has or
may hereafter acquire any immunity from the jurisdiction of any court or from
any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect
to such party or such party's property, Purchaser, Seller and Parent hereby
irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of their respective obligations under
this Agreement, the Company Agreements, the Assignment and the Commutation
Agreement.

                  8.6      Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and
other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in
writing and sufficiently given, upon receipt or three days after deposit in the
United States mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested) or by telex, facsimile or other written form of electronic
communication, to the respective parties as follows:
