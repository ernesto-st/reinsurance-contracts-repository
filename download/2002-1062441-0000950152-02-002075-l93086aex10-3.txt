ARTICLE 2. THE CREDITS


         Section 2.1 REVOLVING COMMITMENT

                  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each
Lender having a Revolving Commitment severally agrees to make Revolving Loans to
the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate
principal amount that will not result in (a) such Lender's Revolving Credit
Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment, or (b) the aggregate
Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders exceeding the Available Revolving
Amount. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

         Section 2.2 LOANS AND BORROWINGS

         (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting
of Revolving Loans made by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with
their respective Revolving Commitments. The failure of any applicable Lender to
make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder, PROVIDED that the Revolving Commitments of the
applicable Lenders are several, and no Lender shall be responsible for any other
Lender's failure to make Loans as required. Subject to Section 3.4, after the
Restatement Date each new Borrowing (other than a Swingline Borrowing) shall be
comprised entirely of (i) Revolving Loans and (ii) ABR Loans or Eurodollar
Loans, as applicable, in each case as the Borrower may request in accordance
herewith. Each Swingline Borrowing shall be a Swingline Loan. Each applicable
Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or
foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan, PROVIDED that any
exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.

         (b) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000. At the time that each ABR
Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000, PROVIDED that an
ABR




                                      -25-
<PAGE>

Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire
unused balance of the Available Revolving Amount or in an aggregate amount that
is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated
by Section 2.8(d). Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the
same time, PROVIDED that there shall not at any time be more than a total of 5
Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

         (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after (i) the Revolving Maturity Date, in the case of Revolving Loans, (ii) the
A Term Maturity Date, in the case of A Term Loans, or (iii) the B Term Maturity
Date, in the case of B Term Loans.

         Section 2.3 REQUESTS FOR BORROWINGS

                  To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three
Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an
ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day
before the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form
approved by the Administrative Agent signed by the Borrower. Each such
telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information
in compliance with Section 2.2:

                  (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

                  (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
         Day;

                  (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
         Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (iv) the location and number of the Borrower's account to
         which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 2.4; and

                  (v) a reasonably detailed calculation of each of the Senior
         Leverage Ratio and, at all times on and after December 31, 2002, the
         Leverage Ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis immediately after
         giving effect to such Borrowing.

                  If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then
the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. Promptly following receipt of
a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent
shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of
such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3,
Swingline Borrowings shall be made in accordance with Section 2.9, and not this
Section 2.3.

         Section 2.4 FUNDING OF BORROWINGS

         (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00
p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most
recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made only as provided in Section 2.9. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly
crediting or otherwise transferring the amounts so received, in like funds, to
an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent and
designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, PROVIDED that
ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.8(d) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the
Issuing Bank, PROVIDED FURTHER that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the
repayment of a Swingline Loan as provided in Section 2.9(c) shall be remitted by
the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender.

         (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section,
paragraph (d) of Section 2.8 or paragraph (c) of Section 2.9 and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
that would be otherwise applicable to such Borrowing. If such Lender pays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

         Section 2.5 TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITMENTS

         (a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall
terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date.

         (b) On each date below, the Revolving Commitments shall be
automatically reduced by an amount equal to (i) the total of the Revolving
Commitments as of September 30, 2003 MULTIPLIED BY (ii) the percentage set forth
below adjacent to such date:

multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $500,000.

that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice

condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Revolving
Commitments hereunder shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving
Commitments hereunder shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in

                                         balance of the B Term Loans
========================================================================

         (d) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the debt of the Borrower to such Lender resulting
from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

         (e) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

         (f) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs
(d) or (e) of this Section shall, to the extent not inconsistent with any
entries made in any promissory note, be prima facie evidence of the existence
and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, PROVIDED that the failure of
any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.

         Section 2.7 PREPAYMENT OF LOANS

         (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time
to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this
Section, PROVIDED that each prepayment of a Term Loan shall be allocated to the
A Term Loans and the B Term Loans, on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans.

         (b) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are
received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any
Prepayment/Reduction Event, then, immediately after such Net Proceeds are
received, (i) the Borrower shall prepay the A Term Loans and the B Term Loans,
on a pro rata basis, in an aggregate amount equal to (A) in the case of each



                                      -30-
<PAGE>

Prepayment/Reduction Event within the meaning of clause (e) of such defined term
(1) 100% of the first $50,000,000 of aggregate Net Proceeds from all such
Prepayment/Reduction Events occurring on or after the Restatement Date, (2) in
the event that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all such Prepayment/Reduction
Events occurring on or after the Restatement Date shall exceed $50,000,000, 75%
of the amount of such excess that is less than or equal to $25,000,000 (E.G., if
the aggregate Net Proceeds from all such Prepayment/Reduction Events occurring
on or after the Restatement Date equals $75,000,000, then the required
prepayment would be $68,750,000 (100% of the first $50,000,000 PLUS 75% of the
next $25,000,000)), and (3) in the event that the aggregate Net Proceeds from
all such Prepayment/Reduction Events occurring on or after the Restatement Date
shall exceed $75,000,000, 50% of the amount of such excess, (B) in the case of
each Prepayment/Reduction Event within the meaning of clauses (a), (b) or (c) of
such defined term, 95% of the Net Proceeds from each such Prepayment/Reduction
Event, and (C) in the case of each other Prepayment/Reduction Event, 100% of the
Net Proceeds from each such Prepayment/Reduction Event, and (ii) following the
repayment of the A Term Loans and the B Term Loans in full, the Borrower shall
prepay the Revolving Loans in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the excess of
such Net Proceeds over the portion thereof, if any, used to prepay the A Term
Loans and the B Term Loans and (B) the outstanding Revolving Loans.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Lenders having outstanding
B Term Loans may elect to forfeit any prepayment of a B Term Borrowing under
this Section 2.7(b), PROVIDED that all such Lenders make such an election with
respect to such prepayment. To make such an election, such Lenders shall notify
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof by telephone not later than
one Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have advised such Lenders
of such prepayment in accordance with Section 2.7(e). Each such telephonic
election shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery
or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written election in a form approved
by the Administrative Agent and signed by each such Lender. Promptly following
receipt of such election, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of
the details thereof, and any amount that, but for this provision, would have
been applied to the B Term Loans shall instead be applied to the A Term Loans.

         (c) In the event of any partial reduction or termination of the
Revolving Commitments, then (i) at or prior to the date of such reduction or
termination, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
applicable Lenders of the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures after giving
effect thereto and (ii) if such sum would exceed the Available Revolving Amount
after giving effect to such reduction or termination, then the Borrower shall,
on the date of such reduction or termination, prepay Revolving Borrowings in an
amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

         (d) OTHER MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

                  (i) If on any day the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure
         exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, within one Business Day
         of such day, prepay the Revolving Loans in an amount equal to the
         lesser of (1) such excess and (2) the aggregate Revolving Credit
         Exposure. Until such excess has been prepaid, the Borrower shall not be
         entitled to borrow additional Revolving Loans.




                                      -31-
<PAGE>

                  (ii) If on the last Business Day of any calendar month, the
         aggregate sum of the cash and cash equivalents of the Loan Parties
         exceeds $7,500,000, the Borrower shall, within three Business Days of
         such day, prepay the Revolving Loans in an amount equal to the lesser
         of (1) such excess and (2) the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure.
         Until such excess has been prepaid, the Borrower shall not be entitled
         to borrow additional Revolving Loans.

                  (iii) Substantially simultaneously with the issuance of the
         Senior Secured Notes, the Borrower will prepay the Term Loans in full
         as provided in Section 7.1(a)(viii).

                  (iv) Substantially simultaneously with the issuance of the
         Subordinated ABRY Notes, the Borrower will prepay Loans as provided in
         Section 7.1(a)(vii).

         (e) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid, PROVIDED that, if a notice of
prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of
the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.5, then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.5. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing hereunder (other than
Swingline Borrowings) shall, when added to the amount of each concurrent
prepayment of other Borrowings (other than Swingline Borrowings), be in an
integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $2,000,000. Each prepayment of a
Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid
Borrowing. Each prepayment of A Term Loans or B Term Loans shall be applied
ratably among the remaining installments of principal required under Section
2.6(b) or 2.6(c), as applicable. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the extent required by Section 3.1.

         Section 2.8 LETTERS OF CREDIT

         (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in dollars
for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent
and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability
Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of
this Credit Agreement and the terms and conditions of any letter of credit
application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by
the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms
and conditions of this Credit Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein contained, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to
issue any Letter of Credit if prior thereto or simultaneously therewith, the
Borrower shall not have borrowed Revolving Loans.




                                      -32-
<PAGE>

         (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE; AMENDMENT; RENEWAL; EXTENSION; CERTAIN
CONDITIONS. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date
of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended,
renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the
amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
and such other information as shall be necessary to issue, amend, renew or
extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower
also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard
form in connection with any request for, and prior to the issuance of, a Letter
of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only
if (and, upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of
Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after
giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC
Exposure shall not exceed $5,000,000 and (ii) the sum of the total Revolving
Credit Exposures shall not exceed the Available Revolving Amount.

         (c) EXPIRATION DATE. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date that is one year after the
date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is ten Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date, PROVIDED that
any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year
periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date that is ten Business
Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date).

         (d) REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, then the Issuing Bank shall either (1) notify
the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank therefor, in which case the Borrower
shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an
amount equal to such LC Disbursement and any accrued interest thereon not later
than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is
made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior
to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on such date, or if such notice has not been
received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than
1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 12:00 noon, New York
City time, on the day of receipt or (ii) the Business Day immediately following
the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received
prior to such time on the day of receipt, PROVIDED that, if the LC Disbursement
is equal to or greater than $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the
conditions of borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.3
or Section 2.9 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or
a Swingline Loan, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing, or (2) notify the
Administrative Agent that the Issuing Bank is requesting that the applicable
Lenders make an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement and any accrued interest thereon, in which case (i) the
Administrative



                                      -33-
<PAGE>

Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of the
amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of such ABR Revolving Borrowing,
and (ii) each Lender shall, whether or not any Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, any representation or warranty shall be accurate, any condition
to the making of any loan hereunder shall have been fulfilled, or any other
matter whatsoever, make the Loan to be made by it under this paragraph by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative
Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders,
(A) on such date, in the event that such Lender shall have received notice of
such ABR Revolving Borrowing prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, or (B) if
such notice has not been received by such Lender prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (X) the Business Day
that such Lender receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 12:00
noon, New York City time, on the day of receipt or (Y) the Business Day
immediately following the day that such Lender receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt. Such Loans
shall, for all purposes hereof, be deemed to be an ABR Revolving Borrowing
referred to in Section 2.1(a) and made pursuant to Section 2.3, and the Lenders
obligations to make such Loans shall be absolute and unconditional. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Issuing Bank by
promptly crediting or otherwise transferring the amounts so received, in like
funds, to the Issuing Bank for the purpose of repaying in full the LC
Disbursement and all accrued interest thereon.

         (e) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the applicable Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender having a Revolving Commitment, and
each such Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate
amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. If the Borrower fails
to make any payment required by paragraph (d) of this Section, or if any such
sum paid by the Borrower is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any
reason, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect
thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Each applicable Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of an amount
equal to the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided
in Section 2.4 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.4 shall
apply, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, to the payment obligations of the applicable Lenders),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the
Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice
to the Lenders, (A) on such date, in the event that such Lender shall have
received notice thereof prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, or (B) if such
notice has not been received by such Lender prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (X) the Business Day that
such Lender receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 12:00
noon, New York City time, on the day of receipt or (Y) the Business Day
immediately following the day that such Lender receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the applicable Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment in respect of such LC Disbursement from the
Borrower pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that



                                      -34-
<PAGE>

Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing
Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or
Swingline Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. Each
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations
pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the
occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the
Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever; PROVIDED, however, that
no Lender shall be obligated to make any payment to the Administrative Agent for
any wrongful LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank as a result of acts or
omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the
Issuing Bank.

         (f) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrower's obligations to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Credit Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Credit Agreement, or any term or provision therein or
herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit
proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing
Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document
that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other
event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither any Credit Party nor any of their
respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason
of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any
payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation,




                                      -35-
<PAGE>

regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance
with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

         (g) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following
its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for
payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of
such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC
Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the
Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

         (h) INTERIM INTEREST. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
PROVIDED that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, then Section 3.1(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing
Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

         (i) CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of
the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative
Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the
applicable Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure with respect to
Letters of Credit as of such date PLUS any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become
effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
Article 8. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral
for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this
Credit Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other
than any interest earned on the investment of such deposit, which investments
shall be in direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations the
principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United
States of America, in each case maturing no later than the expiry date of the
Letter of Credit giving rise to the relevant LC Exposure, such deposit shall not
bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate
in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not
been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC
Exposure at such time or, if




                                      -36-
<PAGE>

the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC
Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
Credit Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such
amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the
Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
or waived.

         Section 2.9 SWINGLINE LOANS

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline
Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower in dollars from time to
time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date to the tenth
Business Day preceding the Revolving Maturity Date in an aggregate principal
amount at any time outstanding that will not result in the Swingline Exposure
exceeding $5,000,000 or result in the sum of the total Revolving Credit
Exposures exceeding the Available Revolving Amount, PROVIDED that the Swingline
Lender shall not be obligated to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an
outstanding Swingline Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Swingline Lender
shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan if (i) prior thereto or
simultaneously therewith the Borrower shall not have borrowed Revolving Loans,
(ii) any applicable Lender shall be in default of its obligations under this
Credit Agreement or (iii) any Credit Party shall have notified the Swingline
Lender and the Borrower in writing at least one Business Day prior to the
Borrowing Date with respect to such Swingline Loan, that the conditions set
forth in Section 5.2 have not been satisfied and such conditions remain
unsatisfied as of the requested time of the making of such Swingline Loan. Each
Swingline Loan shall be due and payable on the maturity thereof, PROVIDED that
in no event shall such maturity be later than the tenth Business Day preceding
the Revolving Maturity Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
contained, all Swingline Loans shall at all times consist of ABR Borrowings.

         (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of the
relevant Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
(i) the aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested date
(which shall be a Business Day) and (iii) the maturity date of the requested
Swingline Loan which shall be not later than seven Business Days after the
making of such Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender will make the requested
amount available promptly on that same day, to the Administrative Agent (for the
account of the Borrower as set forth in Section 2.4) who, thereupon, will
promptly make such amount available to the Borrower in like funds as provided
therein or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.8(d) by remittance to the Issuing
Bank. Each Swingline Loan shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $100,000 and not less than $100,000.

         (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any
Business Day notify the Administrative Agent that the Swingline Lender is
requesting that the applicable Lenders make an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an
amount equal to the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the
Swingline Loans, in which




                                      -37-
<PAGE>

case (i) the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the
details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of
such ABR Revolving Borrowing, and (ii) each Lender shall, regardless of whether
any Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any representation or
warranty shall be accurate, any condition to the making of any loan hereunder
shall have been fulfilled, or any other matter whatsoever, make the Loan to be
made by it under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for
such purpose by notice to the Lenders, (A) on such date, in the event that such
Lender shall have received notice of such ABR Revolving Borrowing prior to 12:00
noon, New York City time, or (B) if such notice has not been received by such
Lender prior to such time on such date, then not later than 1:00 p.m., New York
City time, on (X) the Business Day that such Lender receives such notice, if
such notice is received prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of
receipt or (Y) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Lender
receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the
day of receipt. Such Loans shall, for all purposes hereof, be deemed to be an
ABR Revolving Borrowing referred to in Section 2.1(a) and made pursuant to
Section 2.3, and the Lenders obligations to make such Loans shall be absolute
and unconditional. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to
the Swingline Lender by promptly crediting or otherwise transferring the amounts
so received, in like funds, to the Swingline Lender for the purpose of repaying
in full the Swingline Loans and all accrued interest thereon.

         (d) If the Borrower fails to make any payment with respect to a
Swingline Loan, or if any such sum paid by the Borrower is required to be
refunded to the Borrower for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each applicable Lender of the applicable Swingline Loan, the payment then due
from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage
thereof. Each applicable Lender shall purchase a participation in such Swingline
Loan by paying to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of an
amount equal to the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.4 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.4 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the applicable
Lenders), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the
Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice
to the Lenders, (A) on such date, in the event that such Lender shall have
received notice thereof prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, or (B) if such
notice has not been received by such Lender prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (X) the Business Day that
such Lender receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 12:00
noon, New York City time, on the day of receipt or (Y) the Business Day
immediately following the day that such Lender receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so
received by it from the applicable Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment in respect of such Swingline Loan from the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
Swingline Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Swingline Lender, then to such Lenders and the
Swingline Lender as their interests may appear. Each Lender acknowledges and
agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph
in respect of Swingline Loans is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and



                                      -38-
<PAGE>

continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

         Section 2.10 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SETOFFS

         (a) Each Loan Party shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal of Loans, LC
Disbursements, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Sections 3.5, 3.6,
3.7 or 10.3, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its office at One Wall Street, New
York, New York, or such other office as to which the Administrative Agent may
notify the other parties hereto, except payments to be made to the Issuing Bank
or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments
pursuant to Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 10.3 shall be made directly to the
Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be
due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

         (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal of Loans,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest, fees and commissions then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest,
fees and commissions then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees and commissions then
due to such parties and (ii) second, towards payment of principal of Loans and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal of Loans and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

         (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of, or
interest on, any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline
Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the
aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements or
Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any
other applicable Lender, then the applicable Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans of other applicable
Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall
be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of, and accrued interest on, their respective Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, PROVIDED that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made



                                      -39-
<PAGE>

by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Credit Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other
than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the
provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Loan Party consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable
law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Loan Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the applicable Credit Parties hereunder that such Loan
Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Loan Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to such Credit Parties the amount due.
In such event, if such Loan Party has not in fact made such payment, then each
such Credit Party severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Credit Party with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

         (e) If any Credit Party shall fail to make any payment required to be
made by it pursuant to Sections 2.4(b), 2.8(e) or 2.9(d), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Credit Party to satisfy such Credit Party's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

ARTICLE 3. INTEREST, FEES, YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.


         Section 3.1 INTEREST

         (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

         (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable Margin.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if

                           (i) an Event of Default (other than under paragraphs
         (a) or (b) of Article 8) has occurred and is continuing and the
         Administrative Agent, at the request of or with the consent of Required
         Lenders, so elects by notice to the Borrower then, so long as such
         Event of Default is continuing and such notice has not been rescinded
         by the Administrative Agent at the request of or with the consent of
         Required Lenders, or




                                      -40-
<PAGE>

                           (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing under paragraphs (a) or (b) of Article 8, then, so long as
         such Event of Default is continuing,

all principal of and interest on each Loan and each fee and other amount payable
by the Borrower hereunder shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment,
at a rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of principal of any Loan, 2% PLUS
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding
paragraphs of this Section or (B) in the case of any other amount, 2% PLUS the
Alternate Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Margin relating to ABR Loans.

         (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan, PROVIDED that (i) interest accrued pursuant
to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event
of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than the prepayment of an ABR
Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on
the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment, and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.

         (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate,
Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent,
and such determination shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error.

         Section 3.2 INTEREST ELECTIONS

         (a) Each Borrowing (other than a Swingline Loan) initially shall be of
the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the applicable Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings which
may not be converted or continued.

         (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.3 if the Borrower were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the




                                      -41-
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved
by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

         (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.2:

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
         applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
         different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
         each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
         pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified
         for each resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
         Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; and

                  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
         Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing.

         (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof
and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

         (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request
prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such
Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, (i) no outstanding
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

         Section 3.3 FEES

         (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender having a Revolving Commitment, a commitment fee, which
shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Commitment Fee Margin on the daily
amount of the unused Revolving Commitment PLUS the Swingline Exposure of such
Lender during the period from and including the Restatement Date to but
excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates. Accrued
commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each month, each
date on which the Revolving Commitments are permanently reduced and on the date
on which the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date
to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). Fees under Section 3.3(a) of the Existing Credit Agreement which are
accrued and unpaid as of the Restatement Date shall be payable in accordance
with the provisions of such Section.



                                      -42-
<PAGE>


         (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in
Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Margin on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Restatement Date to but excluding the later of the date
on which such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which
such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the Issuing Bank for its
own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum
separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Issuing Bank on the average
daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Restatement Date to but excluding the later of the date
of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases
to be any such LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
or processing of drawings thereunder. Accrued participation fees and fronting
fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each month, commencing on
the first such date to occur after the date hereof; PROVIDED that all such fees
shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and
any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank
pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within ten days after demand. All
participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). Fees under Section 3.3(b) of the
Existing Credit Agreement which are accrued and unpaid as of the Restatement
Date shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of such Section.

         (c) On the Restatement Date, the Borrower shall (i) pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender that shall have executed and
delivered this Credit Agreement on or prior to the Restatement Date, an amount
equal to 0.40% of the aggregate sum of such Lender's Revolving Commitment (as
such Revolving Commitment is reduced on the effectiveness of this Credit
Agreement) PLUS the outstanding principal balance of such Lender's Term Loans
and (ii) all other fees and other amounts due and payable on or prior to the
Restatement Date, including, to the extent invoiced, reimbursement or payment of
all out-of-pocket expenses required to be reimbursed or paid by the Borrower
hereunder.

         (d) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Credit Party, for its own
account, fees and other amounts payable in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between the Borrower and such Credit Party.

         (e) All fees and other amounts payable hereunder shall be paid on the
dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to
the Issuing Bank, in each case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the
case of commitment and Letter of Credit participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees
and other amounts paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

<PAGE>

         Section 3.4 ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST

                  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
         shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
         means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO
         Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by any applicable
         Lender that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for
         such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
         such Lender of making or maintaining its Loan included in such
         Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
applicable Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the
applicable Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any
Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall
be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         Section 3.5 INCREASED COSTS; ILLEGALITY

         (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
         the account of, or credit extended by, any Credit Party (except any
         such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

                  (ii) impose on any Credit Party or the London interbank market
         any other condition affecting this Credit Agreement, any Eurodollar
         Loans made by such Credit Party or any participation therein or any
         Letter of Credit or participation therein,

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Credit Party of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or the cost to such
Credit Party of issuing, participating in or maintaining any Letter of Credit
hereunder or to increase the cost to such Credit Party or to reduce the amount
of any sum received or receivable by such Credit Party hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or otherwise), then, subject to Section 3.5(c), the Borrower
will pay to such Credit Party such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Credit Party for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

         (b) If any Credit Party determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Credit Party's capital or on the capital of such Credit Party's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement or the Loans made,
the Letters of Credit issued or participations therein held by such Credit

<PAGE>

Party to a level below that which such Credit Party or such Credit Party's
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Credit Party's policies and the policies of such Credit
Party's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then, subject to
Section 3.5(c), from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Credit Party
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Credit Party or such
Credit Party's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

         (c) A certificate of a Credit Party setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Credit Party or its holding company, as applicable,
as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Credit Party the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 3.5(a) or Section 3.5(b), in no event shall the Borrower have any
obligation to reimburse any Lender pursuant to such Sections for any additional
costs incurred or reductions suffered by such Lender more than 90 days prior to
receipt by the Borrower of such certificate.

         (d) Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 3.5(c), failure or
delay on the part of any Credit Party to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Credit Party's right to demand
such compensation.

         (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if,
after the Effective Date, any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any
Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by
written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent:

                  (i) such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not
         thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such
         Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and
         ABR Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into
         Eurodollar Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing or
         to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue a
         Eurodollar Borrowing, as applicable, for an additional Interest Period
         shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or
         a request to continue an ABR Loan as such for an additional Interest
         Period or to convert a Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as
         applicable), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn;
         and

                  (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar
         Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such
         Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans, as of
         the effective date of such notice as provided in the last sentence of
         this paragraph.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) of this
paragraph, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have
been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such
Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied
to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the
conversion of,




                                      -45-
<PAGE>

such Eurodollar Loans, as applicable. For purposes of this paragraph, a notice
to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made
by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently
applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be
effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.

         Section 3.6 BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS

                  In the event of (a) the payment or prepayment (voluntary or
otherwise) of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of
an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.7(e) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period or maturity date applicable thereto as a result of a request by any
Borrower pursuant to Section 3.8(b), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall
compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such
event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an
amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to
such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal
amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it
to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable
amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of
any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         Section 3.7 TAXES

         (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan
Party hereunder and under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, PROVIDED
that, if such Loan Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that, after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the applicable Credit
Party receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii)
such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.




                                      -46-
<PAGE>

         (c) Each Loan Party shall indemnify each Credit Party, within ten days
after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes paid by such Credit Party on or with respect to any payment by or on
account of any obligation of such Loan Party under the Loan Documents (including
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Credit Party, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Credit Party, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
relevant Loan Party is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

         Section 3.8 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS

         (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.5, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.7,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans or Letters of Credit (or any
participation therein) hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Sections 3.5 or 3.7, as applicable, in the future
and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

         (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.5, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.7, in
an aggregate amount in excess of $25,000, then the Borrower may, at its sole
expense (including the fees referred to in Section 10.4(b)) and effort, upon
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 10.4), all its interests, rights and



                                      -47-
<PAGE>

obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); PROVIDED that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is
being assigned, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.5 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 3.7, such assignment will result in a reduction
in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any
such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require
such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

ARTICLE 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  The Borrower represents and warrants to the Credit Parties
that:

         Section 4.1 ORGANIZATION; POWERS

                  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as
now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every
jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

         Section 4.2 AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY

                  The Transactions are within the corporate, partnership or
other analogous powers of each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries to the
extent it is a party thereto and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate, partnership or other analogous and, if required, equityholder action.
Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries to the extent it is a party thereto and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation thereof, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally.

         Section 4.3 GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS

                  The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval
of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental
Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and
effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter,
by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or
result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a
right



                                      -48-
<PAGE>

thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (other than Liens
permitted by Section 7.2).

         Section 4.4 FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

         (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Credit Parties (i) its
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 containing the
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders equity and
cash flows of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
public accountants, (ii) its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2001, containing the consolidated balance sheet and statements of income and
cash flows of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal quarter
and the portion of the fiscal year then ended certified by its chief financial
officer, and (iii) financial projections for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
for the period January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2002. The consolidated
financial statements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and
cash flows of the Borrower and consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and
for the indicated periods in accordance with GAAP and are consistent with the
books and records of the Borrower (which books and records are correct and
complete), subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in
the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

         (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters, the Borrower is unaware that the
Borrower or any Subsidiary has any material undisclosed liability (contingent or
otherwise). Except for Disclosed Matters, since September 30, 2001, there has
been no material adverse change in the business, assets, operations, prospects
or condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

         (c) [RESERVED]

         Section 4.5 PROPERTIES

         (a) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has good title to, or
valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to its
business, except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with its
ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties for their intended purposes.

         (b) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries owns, or is entitled to
use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for
any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.




                                      -49-
<PAGE>

         (c) Schedule 4.5 sets forth the address of each real property that is
owned or leased by the Borrower or any of the Domestic Subsidiaries.

         (d) Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries have received
notice of, or have knowledge of, any pending or contemplated condemnation
proceeding affecting any Mortgaged Property or any sale or disposition thereof
in lieu of condemnation. Neither any Mortgaged Property nor any interest therein
is subject to any right of first refusal, option or other contractual right to
purchase such Mortgaged Property or interest therein.

         Section 4.6 LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries (i) that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other
than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve any Loan Document or any
Transaction.

         (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters, and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries (i) have failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to
obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required
under any Environmental Law, (ii) have become subject to any Environmental
Liability, (iii) have received notice of any claim with respect to any
Environmental Liability or (iv) know of any basis for any Environmental
Liability.

         (c) Since the Restatement Date, there has been no change in the status
of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted
in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.7 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND AGREEMENTS

                  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable
to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments
binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

         Section 4.8 INVESTMENT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS

                  Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries are (a) an
"investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.




                                      -50-
<PAGE>

         Section 4.9 TAXES

                  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has timely filed or
caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been filed and
has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except
(a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its
books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.10 ERISA

                  No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability
is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated benefit
obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of
the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $8,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $8,000,000 the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

         Section 4.11 DISCLOSURE

                  The Borrower has disclosed to the Credit Parties all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any
of the Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the reports, financial statements, certificates
or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
to any Credit Party in connection with the negotiation of the Loan Documents or
delivered thereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
be reasonable at the time.

         Section 4.12 SUBSIDIARIES

                  Schedule 4.12 sets forth the name of, and the ownership
interest of the Borrower in, each Subsidiary and identifies each Subsidiary that
is a Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case as of the Restatement Date.




                                      -51-
<PAGE>

         Section 4.13 INSURANCE

                  Schedule 4.13 sets forth a description of all insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of the
Restatement Date. As of the Restatement Date, all premiums in respect of such
insurance that are due and payable have been paid.

         Section 4.14 LABOR MATTERS

                  As of the Restatement Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or
slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law
dealing with such matters, except where any such violations, individually and in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. All material payments due from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for
which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account
of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.
The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any right of
termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any
collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is
bound.

         Section 4.15 SOLVENCY

                  Immediately after the consummation of each Transaction and
immediately following the making of each Loan, if any, and the issuance of each
Letter of Credit, if any, made or issued on the date thereof and after giving
effect to the application of the proceeds of such Loan and such Letter of
Credit, (a) the fair value of the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of
the property of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
their debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) each of the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors will be able to pay its debts and
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) each of the Borrower and the
Subsidiary Guarantors will not have unreasonably small capital with which to
conduct the business in which it is engaged as such business is now conducted
and is proposed to be conducted following such date.

         Section 4.16 SECURITY DOCUMENTS

         (a) Each of the Supplemental Security Agreement and the Security
Agreement is effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security
interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Supplemental Security Agreement or
the Security Agreement) and, when (i) the pledged property constituting such
Collateral is delivered to the Administrative Agent, (ii) financing statements
in appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 6 to the
Perfection Certificate, (iii) all other applicable filings under the Uniform




                                      -52-
<PAGE>

Commercial Code or otherwise that are required under the Loan Documents are
made, and (iv) all control agreements required by the terms of the Supplemental
Security Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by the appropriate
parties thereto, each of the Supplemental Security Agreement and the Security
Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such Collateral and
such Supplemental Collateral (other than the Intellectual Property (as defined
in the Security Agreement) and other than Deposit Accounts and Securities
Accounts (as defined in the Supplemental Security Agreement) with respect to
which a control agreement is not required to be delivered pursuant to the
Supplemental Security Agreement), in each case prior and superior in right to
any other Person, other than with respect to Liens expressly permitted by
Section 7.2.

         (b) When the Security Agreement is filed in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, the Security
Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors in
the Intellectual Property (as defined in the Security Agreement) in which a
security interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registering a
security agreement, financing statement or analogous document in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, as
applicable, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other
than with respect to Liens expressly permitted by Section 7.2 (it being
understood that subsequent recordings in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and the United States Copyright Office may be necessary to perfect a Lien
on registered trademarks, trademark applications and copyrights acquired by the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors after the Restatement Date).

         (c) The Mortgages, if any, are effective to create, subject to the
exceptions listed in each title insurance policy covering such Mortgage, in
favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured
Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of the right, title and
interest of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors in and to the Mortgaged
Properties thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and when such Mortgages are
filed in the appropriate offices, such Mortgages shall constitute a Lien on, and
security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Borrower and the
Subsidiary Guarantors in such Mortgaged Properties and the proceeds thereof, in
each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other than with
respect to the rights of Persons pursuant to Liens expressly permitted by
Section 7.2.

         Section 4.17 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS

         (a) Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries are engaged
principally, or as one of their important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of buying or carrying Margin Stock.

         (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly
or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, to purchase,
acquire or carry any Margin Stock or for any purpose that entails a violation
of, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the regulations of the
Board, including Regulation T, U or X.

the applicable Collateral in a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or
(ii) as a result of the Administrative Agent's failure to maintain possession of
any stock certificates, promissory notes or other instruments delivered to it
under the Security Documents; or

         (o) a Change in Control shall occur;

(A) then, and in every such event (other than an event described in clause (h)

such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required

<PAGE>

demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
the Borrower.

ARTICLE 9. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Credit Parties as shall be
necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.2), and (c) except
as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Borrower, any of the Subsidiaries or any other Loan
Party that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Credit Parties as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 10.2) or in the absence of its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not
to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Credit Party (and,
promptly after its receipt of any such notice, it shall give each Credit Party
and the Borrower notice thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii)
the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder
or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth therein, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness thereof or any other
agreement, instrument or other document or (v) the




                                      -75-
<PAGE>

satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 5 or elsewhere herein, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that no such delegation shall
serve as a release of the Administrative Agent or waiver by the Borrower of any
rights hereunder. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform
any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Credit Parties and the Borrower. Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation
with the Borrower, to appoint a successor (a) from among the Lenders, or (b)
with the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed or, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, required), other than a Lender. If no successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Credit
Parties, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.3 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative
Agent.

                  Each Credit Party acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party and
based on such documents and information as it



                                      -76-
<PAGE>


has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
this Credit Agreement. Each Credit Party also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Credit Party and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon any Loan Document, any related agreement or
any document furnished thereunder.

                  Notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary,
no Agent acting in such capacity other than the Administrative Agent shall have
any duty or obligation under the Loan Documents.

ARTICLE 10. MISCELLANEOUS


         Section 10.1 NOTICES

         Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly

telecopy, as follows:

         (a) if to the Borrower, to it at Penton Media, Inc., 1300 East 9th

         Section 10.2 WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS

         (a) No failure or delay by any Credit Party in exercising any right or
power under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and



                                      -77-
<PAGE>

remedies of the Credit Parties under the Loan Documents are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any
Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
the issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Credit Party may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

         (b) Neither this Credit Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders, PROVIDED
that no such agreement shall (i) increase any Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or any LC Disbursement, or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any
fees or other amounts payable under the Loan Documents, or reduce the amount of
any scheduled reduction of the Revolving Commitments, without the written
consent of each Credit Party affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date
of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or any LC Disbursement, or any
interest thereon, or any fees or other amounts payable under the Loan Documents,
or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, postpone the
scheduled date of reduction or expiration of the Revolving Commitments, or
postpone the final expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving
Maturity Date, without the written consent of each Credit Party affected
thereby, (iv) change any provision hereof in a manner that would alter the pro
rata sharing of payments required by any Loan Document, without the written
consent of each Credit Party, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section
or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying
the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any
rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release any Subsidiary
Guarantor from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement (except as expressly
provided in the Guarantee Agreement or as a result of the termination of the
existence of such Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section
7.3), or limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written
consent of each Lender, or (vii) release any of the Collateral from the Liens of
the Loan Documents (except as expressly provided in the Security Agreement or in
connection with a transaction permitted by Section 7.3), without the consent of
each Lender, and PROVIDED, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify
or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the
Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be.

         Section 10.3 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER

         (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
herein, the preparation and administration of this Credit Agreement or any
amendments,



                                      -78-
<PAGE>

modifications or waivers of the provisions of any Loan Document (whether or not
the transactions contemplated thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand
for payment thereunder, (iii) all fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the
Lender's professionals agreed to by the Borrower, and (iv) all out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by any Credit Party, including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for any Credit Party, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents,
including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans or Letters of Credit.

         (b) The Borrower shall indemnify each Credit Party and each Related
Party thereof (each such Person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold
each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or
delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any
other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or
the use of the proceeds thereof including any refusal of the Issuing Bank to
honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented
in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such
Letter of Credit, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of
the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto, PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

         (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under paragraphs
(a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, an amount equal to the
product of such unpaid amount MULTIPLIED BY a fraction, the numerator of which
is the sum of such Lender's Revolving Commitment PLUS the outstanding principal
balance of such Lender's A Term Loan PLUS the outstanding principal balance of
such Lender's B Term Loan and the denominator of which is the sum of the total
of all Lenders' Revolving Commitments PLUS the outstanding principal balance of
all Lenders' A Term Loans PLUS the outstanding principal balance of all Lenders'
B Term Loans (in each case determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of, PROVIDED that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as applicable, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative
Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.




                                      -79-
<PAGE>

         (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, any Loan Document or any agreement, instrument or other document
contemplated thereby, the Transactions or any Loan or any Letter of Credit or
the use of the proceeds thereof.

         (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly but in
no event later than ten days after written demand therefor.

         Section 10.4 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

         (a) The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Credit Party (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each Credit Party) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of any Loan Document.

         (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it),
PROVIDED that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate or an Approved Fund of a Lender, the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of an assignment of all or any portion of a Revolving Commitment or
obligations in respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the Issuing
Bank and/or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be), must give its prior
written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate or an Approved Fund of a Lender or an assignment of the entire
remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment, the amount of
the Revolving Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$5,000,000 unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, (iii) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance together with, unless otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent, a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (iv) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under the Loan Documents (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's



                                      -80-
<PAGE>

rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5,
3.6, 3.7 and 10.3). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under the Loan Documents that does not comply with this paragraph
shall be treated for purposes of the Loan Documents as a sale by such Lender of
a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e)
of this Section.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Revolving Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error,
and the Borrower and each Credit Party may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Credit
Party, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

         (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Credit Agreement unless it
has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

         (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or any Credit
Party, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each such
bank or other entity being called a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to it),
PROVIDED that (i) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Loan
Parties and the Credit Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the
Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of any Loan Documents, PROVIDED that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the
first proviso to Section 10.2(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 to the same extent as
if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.8 as though it were a
Lender, PROVIDED that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.10(c)
as though it were a Lender.



                                      -81-
<PAGE>

         (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Sections 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7 than the Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.7 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.7(e) as though
it were a Lender.

         (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest, PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations under the
Loan Documents or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a
party hereto.

         Section 10.5 SURVIVAL

                  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Credit Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of any Loan Document and the
making of any Loans and the issuance of any Letter of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that any Credit Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or
incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal
of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any LC Disbursement or any fee or any
other amount payable under the Loan Documents is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 10.3 and Article 9
shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and the LC
Disbursements, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Credit Agreement or
any provision hereof.

         Section 10.6 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS

                  This Credit Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by
different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute
but one contract. This Credit Agreement and any separate letter agreements with
respect to fees payable to any Credit Party constitute the entire contract among
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all
previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.1, this Credit Agreement shall
become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together, bear the signatures of the Borrower and Required Lenders,
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the




                                      -82-
<PAGE>

benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Lenders, the Issuing
Bank, the Swingline Lender and the other parties hereto, and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Credit
Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Credit Agreement.

         Section 10.7 SEVERABILITY

                  In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Credit Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being
understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in
any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

         Section 10.8 RIGHT OF SETOFF

                  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by it to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all
the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Credit
Agreement held by it, irrespective of whether or not it shall have made any
demand under this Credit Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each the Lenders and their respective Affiliates under
this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) that it may have.

         Section 10.9 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS

         (a) THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City,
and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Credit Agreement shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party may otherwise have to bring
any action or



                                      -83-
<PAGE>

proceeding relating to this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents against
the Borrower, or any of its property, in the courts of any jurisdiction.

         (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents
in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

         (d) Each party to this Credit Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.1. Nothing in this
Credit Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Credit Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         Section 10.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         Section 10.11 HEADINGS

                  Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used
herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Credit
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Credit Agreement.

         Section 10.12 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any
time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges
and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law
(collectively the "CHARGES"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM
RATE") that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the
Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest
payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all of the charges
payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the maximum rate and, to the
extent lawful, the interest and the charges that would have been payable in
respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this
Section shall be cumulated, and the interest and the




                                      -84-
<PAGE>

charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the maximum rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

         Section 10.13 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

                  Each Credit Party agrees to use reasonable precautions to keep
confidential, in accordance with their customary procedures for handling
confidential information of the same nature, all information supplied by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to this Credit Agreement that (a) is clearly
identified by such Person as being confidential at the time the same is
delivered to such Credit Party, or (b) constitutes any financial statement,
financial projections or forecasts, budget, compliance certificate, audit
report, management letter or accountants' certification delivered hereunder
("INFORMATION"), PROVIDED, however, that nothing herein shall limit the
disclosure of any such Information (i) to such of their respective Related
Parties as need to know such Information, (ii) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, or
requested by any bank regulatory authority, (iii) on a confidential basis, to

available to any of the Credit Parties on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or (C) was, is or becomes available
to the Credit Parties on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to any
of them by the Borrower or any Subsidiary; and (viii) to the extent the Borrower
shall have consented to such disclosure in writing.

         Section 10.14 SAVINGS CLAUSE

                  This Credit Agreement is intended solely as an amendment of,
and contemporaneous restatement of, the terms and conditions of the Existing
Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that this Credit Agreement and the commitments
and extensions of credit provided hereunder represent an amendment to, but not a
novation or discharge of, the credit facilities provided by the Existing Credit
Agreement. Nothing in this Credit Agreement is intended to affect the right of
any Credit Party (including any "Credit Party" under and as defined in the
Existing Credit Agreement) to payment of any amount due under the Existing
Credit Agreement for the period prior to the Restatement Date, and such right
shall be determined under the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement. The
Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that any choses in action or other
rights created in favor of any Credit Party (including any "Credit Party" under
and as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) or any of its successors or
assigns arising out of the representations and warranties of the Borrower
contained in or delivered in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement
(including the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1 and 4.11
thereof and any other representations and warranties delivered in connection
with the making of extensions of credit), shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Credit Agreement.

         Section 10.15 RESTATEMENT DATE AFFIRMATIONS AND RELEASE

or equity, which such Loan Party ever had, now has or hereafter can, shall or
may have against such Credit Party or any Related Party of such Credit Party

        FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PENTON MEDIA, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "BORROWER"), hereby promises to pay to the order of
(the "LENDER") the unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by the Lender to
the Borrower, in the amounts and at the times set forth in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 8, 2002, among the Borrower, the
Lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Bank One, NA
and Fleet National Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents, and The Bank of New York,
as Administrative Agent (as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), and to pay interest from
the date hereof on the principal balance of such Loans from time to time
outstanding at the rate or rates and at the times set forth in the Credit
Agreement, in each case at the office of the Administrative Agent located at One
Wall Street, New York, New York, or at such other place as the Administrative
Agent may specify from time to time, in lawful money of the United States in
immediately available funds. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used
herein with the same meanings.

        The Loans evidenced by this Note are prepayable in the amounts, and
under the circumstances, and their respective maturities are subject to
acceleration upon the terms, set forth in the Credit Agreement. This Note is
subject to, and should be construed in accordance with, the provisions of the
Credit Agreement and is entitled to the benefits and security set forth in the
Loan Documents.

        The Lender is hereby authorized to record on the schedule annexed
hereto, and any continuation sheets that the Lender may attach hereto, (a) the
date of each Loan made by the Lender to the Borrower, (b) the class, Type and
amount thereof, (c) the interest rate (without regard to the Applicable Margin)
and Interest Period applicable to each Eurodollar Loan and (d) the date and
amount of each conversion of, and each payment or prepayment of the principal
of, any such Loan. The entries made in such schedule shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein,
PROVIDED that the failure to so record or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance
with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

        Except as specifically otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement, the
Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice
of protest and all other demands, protests and notices in connection with the
execution, delivery, performance, collection and enforcement of this Note.


<PAGE>


        Whenever in this Note either party hereto is referred to, such reference
shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party. The
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder
or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be void) except
as expressly permitted by the Loan Documents. No failure or delay of the Lender

unconditionally agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all
claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in such
Federal court. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or

Note shall affect any right that the Lender may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Note or the other Loan Documents against
the Borrower, or any of its property, in the courts of any jurisdiction.

        The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may

                             ----------------------

                                                                   March 8, 2002
                                                              New York, New York

        FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PENTON MEDIA, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "BORROWER"), hereby promises to pay to the order of THE BANK OF
NEW YORK (the "SWINGLINE LENDER") the unpaid principal amount of the Swingline
Loans made by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower, in the amounts and at the
times set forth in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March
8, 2002, among the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A.,
as Syndication Agent, Bank One, NA and Fleet National Bank, as Co-Documentation
Agents, and The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (as the same may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "CREDIT
AGREEMENT"), and to pay interest from the date hereof on the principal balance
of such Swingline Loans from time to time outstanding at the rate or rates and
at the times set forth in the Credit Agreement, in each case at the office of
the Administrative Agent located at One Wall Street, New York, New York, or at
such other place as the Administrative Agent may specify from time to time, in
lawful money of the United States in immediately available funds. Terms defined
in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings.

        The Swingline Loans evidenced by the Swingline Note are repayable in the
amounts, and their respective maturities are subject to acceleration upon the
terms, set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Swingline Note is subject to, and
should be construed in accordance with, the provisions of the Credit Agreement
and is entitled to the benefits and security set forth in the Loan Documents.

        The Swingline Lender is hereby authorized to record on the schedule
annexed hereto, and any continuation sheets that the Swingline Lender may attach
hereto, (a) the date of each Loan made by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower,
(b) the amount thereof, (c) the maturity date applicable to each Swingline Loan
and (d) the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of the principal of,
any such Swingline Loan. The entries made in such schedule shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein,
PROVIDED that the failure to so record or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Swingline Loans in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

        Except as specifically otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement, the
Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice
of protest and all other

demands, protests and notices in connection with the execution, delivery,
performance, collection and enforcement of the Swingline Note.

        Whenever in the Swingline Note either party hereto is referred to, such
reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party.
The Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations
hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment shall be
void) except as expressly permitted by the Loan Documents. No failure or delay
of the Swingline Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right
or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. Neither the Swingline Note nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified, nor shall any departure therefrom be consented to,
except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Borrower and the
Swingline Lender with respect to which such waiver, amendment, modification or
consent is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section
10.2 of the Credit Agreement.

        THE SWINGLINE NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

        All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given
as provided in Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement.

        The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court
or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to the Swingline Note or the other Loan Documents, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all
claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in such
Federal court. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in the
Swingline Note shall affect any right that the Swingline Lender may otherwise
have to bring any action or proceeding relating to the Swingline Note or the
other Loan Documents against the Borrower, or any of its property, in the courts
of any jurisdiction.

         The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to the Swingline Note or the other Loan Documents in
any court referred to in the preceding paragraph hereof. The

subsequent version or amendment to any Article of the UCC.

         Section 1.3 GRANT OF SECURITY

                  (a) GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST: As security for the payment or
performance, as applicable, in full of the Obligations, each Grantor hereby
bargains, sells, conveys, assigns, sets over, mortgages, pledges, hypothecates
and transfers to the Administrative Agent (and its successors and assigns), for
the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, and hereby grants to the
Administrative Agent (and its successors and assigns), for the ratable benefit
of the Secured Parties, a security interest (the "SECURITY INTEREST") in all of
such Grantor's right, title and interest in, to and under the following, in each
case whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising and wherever
located (all of which



                                     - 3 -

being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "COLLATERAL"): (i) all
Investment Related Property, (ii) to the extent not otherwise included in clause
(i) of this Section, all Collateral Records, Collateral Support and Supporting
Obligations in respect of any of the foregoing, (iii) to the extent not
otherwise included in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section, the account referred
to in Section 3.2(c)(ii) and all funds and other property from time to time in,
or credited to, such account or any Deposit Account or Securities Account, and
(iv) to the extent not otherwise included in clauses (i) through (iii) of this
Section, all Proceeds, products, substitutions, accessions, rents and profits of
or in respect of any of the foregoing.

                (b) REVISIONS TO UCC. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
expressly understood and agreed that, to the extent the UCC is revised after the
date hereof such that the definition of any of the foregoing terms included in
the description or definition of the Collateral is changed, the parties hereto
desire that any property which is included in such changed definitions, but
which would not otherwise be included in the Security Interest on the date
hereof, nevertheless be included in the Security Interest upon the effective
date of such revision. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the
Security Interest is intended to apply immediately on the Applicable Date to all
of the Collateral to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, regardless
of whether any particular item of the Collateral was then subject to the UCC.

ARTICLE 2.    SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS; NO ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITY

    Section 2.1 SECURITY FOR OBLIGATIONS

                This Supplemental Security Agreement secures, and the Collateral
is collateral security for, the prompt and complete payment or performance in
full when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration,
acceleration, demand or otherwise (including the payment of amounts that would
become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 262(a) of
Title 11 of the United States Code, or any similar provision of any other
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar law), of all Obligations
with respect to each Grantor.

    Section 2.2 NO ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITY

                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Security
Interest is granted as security only and shall not subject the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party to, or in any way alter or modify, any
obligation or liability of any Grantor with respect to or arising out of the
Collateral.

        identify it in the conduct of its business or in the ownership of its
        properties, (B) in the location of its chief executive office, principal
        place of business, any office in which it maintains books or records

        3.2, any office or facility at which any such Collateral is located
        (including the establishment of any such new office or facility), (C) in
        its identity or legal or organizational structure or its jurisdiction of
        formation, or (D) in its Federal Taxpayer Identification Number. It
        agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in the preceding
        sentence unless all filings have been made under the UCC or otherwise
        that are required in order for the Administrative Agent to continue at
        all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected
        security interest in all the Collateral with the priority required
        hereby.

                         (ii) It shall maintain, at its own cost and expense,

        or held by it or on its behalf as is consistent with its current

        used in industries that are the same as or similar to those in which it
        is engaged, but in any event to include complete accounting Records

        and all actions necessary to defend title to the Collateral owned or
        held by it or on its behalf against all Persons and to defend the
        Security Interest in such Collateral and the priority thereof against
        any Lien or other interest not expressly permitted by the Loan
        Documents, and in furtherance thereof, it shall not take, or permit to
        be taken, any action not otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan
        Documents that could impair the Security Interest or the priority
        thereof or any Secured Party's rights in or to such Collateral.

                (iv) The Administrative Agent and such Persons as the
Administrative Agent may designate shall have the right, at the cost and expense
of such Grantor, to inspect all of its Records (and to make extracts and copies
from such Records), to discuss its affairs with its officers and independent
accountants and to verify under reasonable procedures the validity, amount,
quality, quantity, value, condition and status of, or any other matter relating
to, the Collateral owned or held by or on behalf of such Grantor, including, in
the case of Collateral in the possession of any third person, by contacting
contract parties or other obligors thereon or any third person possessing such
Collateral for the purpose of making such a verification. The Administrative
Agent shall have the absolute right to share on a confidential basis any
information it gains from such inspection or verification with any Secured
Party.

                (v) At its option, the Administrative Agent may discharge past
due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other
encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral owned or held by or
on behalf of such Grantor, and not permitted by the Loan Documents, and may pay
for the maintenance and preservation of such Collateral to the extent such
Grantor fails to do so as required by the Loan Documents, and such Grantor
agrees, jointly with the other Grantors and severally, to reimburse the
Administrative Agent on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; PROVIDED,
however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any
Grantor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to cure or perform, any
covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes, assessments,
charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance
as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

                (vi) It shall remain liable to observe and perform all the
conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each
contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral owned or held by it
or on its behalf, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and
it agrees, jointly with the other Grantors and severally, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties from and against
any and all liability for such performance.

                (vii) It shall not make, or permit to be made, an assignment,
pledge or hypothecation of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf,
or grant any other Lien in respect of such Collateral, except as expressly
permitted by the Loan Documents. Except for Liens expressly permitted by the
Loan Documents, it shall not make or permit to be made any transfer of such
Collateral, and it shall remain at all times in possession of such Collateral,
except that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall notify it that an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and that, during the
continuance thereof, it shall not sell, convey, lease, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any such Collateral (which notice may be given by telephone
if promptly confirmed in writing), it may use and dispose of such Collateral in
any lawful manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Supplemental
Security Agreement or any other Loan Document.

    Section 3.2 INVESTMENT RELATED PROPERTY

                (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each of the Grantors,
jointly with the other Grantors and severally, represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties that Schedule 3.2 hereto or
to the applicable Supplement sets forth, as of the Applicable Date, all of the
Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts included in the Collateral owned or
held by or on behalf of such Grantor.

                (b) REGISTRATION IN NOMINEE NAME; DENOMINATIONS. Each Grantor

the name of its nominee (as pledgee or as sub-agent) or the name of the
applicable Grantor, endorsed or assigned, where applicable, in blank or in favor
of the Administrative Agent, (ii) at the Administrative Agent's request, such
Grantor will promptly give to the Administrative Agent copies of any material
notices or other communications received by it with respect to any Investment

shall at all times have the right to exchange any certificates, instruments or
other documents representing or evidencing any Investment Related Property owned
or held by or on behalf of such Grantor for certificates, instruments or other
documents of smaller or larger denominations for any purpose consistent with
this Supplemental Security Agreement.

                (c)  VOTING AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

        exercise any and all voting and/or other consensual rights and powers
        inuring to an owner of the Investment Related Property, or any part
        thereof, for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Supplemental
        Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
        such Grantor will not be entitled to exercise any such right if the
        result thereof could materially and adversely affect the rights inuring
        to a holder of the Investment Related Property or the rights and
        remedies of any of the Secured Parties under this Supplemental Security
        Agreement or any other Loan Document or the ability of any of the
        Secured Parties to exercise the same.

                                 (B)     The Administrative Agent shall execute
        and deliver to each Grantor, or cause to be executed and delivered to
        each Grantor, all such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments
        as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling it to
        exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled
        to exercise pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(A) and to receive the cash
        payments it is entitled to receive pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(C).

                                 (C)     Each Grantor shall be entitled to
        receive, retain and use any and all cash dividends, interest and
        principal paid on the Investment Related Property owned or held by it or
        on its behalf to the extent and only to the extent that such cash

dividends, interest and principal paid or payable in cash or otherwise in
connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of
capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other
than distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect
of the Investment Related Property, whether paid or payable in cash or
otherwise, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification
of the outstanding securities of any issuer of any Investment Related Property
or received in exchange for any Investment Related Property, or any part
thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation,
acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or
otherwise, shall be and become part of the Collateral, and, if received by such
Grantor, shall not be commingled with any of its other funds or property but
shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent hereunder and shall be forthwith delivered
to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement).

                (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:

                         (A)     All rights of each Grantor to dividends,
interest or principal that it is authorized to receive pursuant to subsection
(c)(i)(C) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the
Administrative Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and
authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest or principal, as
applicable. All dividends, interest and principal received by or on behalf of
any Grantor contrary to the provisions of this Section shall be held in trust
for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other
property or funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith delivered to the
Administrative Agent upon demand in the same form as so received (with any
necessary endorsement). Any and all money and other property paid over to or
received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection (c)(ii)(A) shall be retained by the Administrative Agent in an
account to be established in the name of the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, upon receipt of such money or other
property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2.
Subject to the provisions of this subsection (c)(ii)(A), such account shall at

and the Administrative Agent shall at all times have the sole right to make
withdrawals therefrom and to exercise all rights with respect to the funds and
other property from time to time therein or credited thereto as set forth in the
Loan Documents. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, the
Administrative Agent shall, within five Business Days after all such Events of
Default have been cured or waived, repay to the applicable Grantor all cash
dividends, interest and principal (without interest) that such Grantor would
otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of subsection (c)(i)(C)
and which remain in such account.

                                 (B)     All rights of each Grantor to exercise
        the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise
        pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(A), and the obligations of the
        Administrative Agent under subsection (c)(i)(B), shall cease, and all
        such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent,
        which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise
        such voting and consensual rights and powers, PROVIDED that, unless
        otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
        shall have the right from time to time following and during the
        continuance of an Event of Default to permit such Grantor to exercise
        such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, the
        applicable Grantor will have the right to exercise the voting and
        consensual rights and powers that it would otherwise be entitled to
        exercise pursuant to the terms of subsection (c)(i)(A).

                (d) CASH AND INVESTMENT PROPERTY. Each Grantor covenants and
agrees that (i) with respect to each of its Deposit Accounts existing on the
date hereof and set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, it shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to the Administrative Agent, by no later than April 15, 2002, a
duly executed Deposit Account Control Agreement with respect to each such
Deposit Account (other than a Deposit Account that at all times has less than
(A) $25,000 on deposit therein, and (B) when aggregated with all other Deposit
Accounts that are not subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement in favor of
the Administrative Agent, $100,000 on deposit therein), (ii) it shall not at any
time establish or maintain any other Deposit Account without first delivering to
the Administrative Agent a duly executed Deposit Account Control Agreement with
respect to such Deposit Account, (iii) with respect to each of its Securities
Accounts existing on the date hereof and set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, it
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Administrative Agent, by no
later than April 15, 2002, a duly executed Securities Account Control Agreement
with respect to each such Securities Account, (iv) it shall not at any time
establish or maintain any other Securities Account without first delivering to
the Administrative Agent a duly executed Securities Account Control Agreement
with respect to such Securities Account, and (v) it shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, no less frequently than every other Business Day all of its
Investment Related Property (other than Deposit Accounts and Securities
Accounts) into one or more such Deposit Accounts or Securities Accounts. Prior
to the delivery of a "Notice of Exclusive Control" under the applicable Control
Agreement, and pursuant to the terms thereof and the other Loan Documents, each
Deposit Account and/or Securities Account shall at all times be under the
"control" (within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC) of the Administrative
Agent or an agent of the Administrative Agent, and no Grantor shall have access
to or any right to draw upon or withdraw any cash or other funds therefrom,
except for purposes not otherwise prohibited by the Loan Documents.

ARTICLE 4.   FURTHER ASSURANCES

                Each Grantor hereby covenants and agrees, at its own cost and
expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and/or cause to be duly filed all such
further agreements, instruments and other documents (including favorable legal
opinions in connection with any Transaction), and take all such further actions,
that the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request to
preserve, protect and perfect (including as a result of any revisions to Article
9 of the UCC in any jurisdiction or the effectiveness thereof or any other
change in applicable law) the Security Interest granted by it and




                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>


the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and
taxes required in connection with its execution and delivery of this
Supplemental Security Agreement, the granting by it of the Security Interest and
the filing of any financing statements or other documents in connection herewith
or therewith. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to file one or
more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to
all or any part of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf without
the signature of such Grantor and agrees that a photographic or other
reproduction of this Supplemental Security Agreement or of a financing statement
signed by such Grantor shall be sufficient as a financing statement and may be
filed as a financing statement in any and all jurisdictions. Each Grantor hereby
further irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to file a Record or
Records, including financing statements, in all jurisdictions and with all
filing offices that the Administrative Agent may determine, in its sole and
absolute discretion, are necessary, advisable or prudent to perfect the Security
Interest granted by it and agrees that such financing statements may describe
the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf in the same manner as
described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that
describes such Collateral in any other manner that the Administrative Agent may
determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, is necessary, advisable or
prudent to perfect the Security Interest granted by such Grantor, including
describing such property as "all assets" or "all personal property."

ARTICLE 5. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT

                Each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as its
true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of carrying out the
provisions of this Supplemental Security Agreement and taking any action and
executing any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable
and coupled with an interest, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, with power of
substitution for such Grantor and in such Grantor's name or otherwise, for the
use and benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and at such
other time or times permitted by the Loan Documents, (i) to receive, endorse,
assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money
orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral owned or held by
it or on its behalf or any part thereof; (ii) to demand, collect, receive
payment of, give receipt for, and give discharges and releases of, any of such
Collateral; (iii) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or
proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to
collect or otherwise realize on any of the Collateral owned or held by it or on
its behalf or to enforce any rights in respect of any of such Collateral; (iv)
to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or
proceedings relating to any of such Collateral; (v) to notify, or to require
such Grantor to notify, obligors to make payment directly to the Administrative
Agent, and (vi) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with
respect to or otherwise deal with any of such Collateral, and to do all other
acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Supplemental
Security Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent
were the absolute owner of such Collateral for all purposes; PROVIDED, however,
that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any commitment or to
make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency




                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>


of any payment received by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party,
or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to
any of the Collateral or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or
any property covered thereby, and no action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party with respect to any of the
Collateral shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in favor of
such Grantor or to any claim or action against the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party. The provisions of this Article shall in no event relieve
any Grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents with respect to any of the Collateral or impose any obligation on the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to proceed in any particular
manner with respect to any of the Collateral, or in any way limit the exercise
by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any other or further
right that it may have on the date of this Supplemental Security Agreement or
hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other Loan Document, by law or
otherwise. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed
to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section
9-610(b) of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York or its equivalent in
other jurisdictions (or any successor provision).

ARTICLE 6.   REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

    Section 6.1 REMEDIES GENERALLY

                (a) GENERAL RIGHTS. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of
Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf to the Administrative Agent on
demand, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right,
with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for
performance, to take possession of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its
behalf and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where such
Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing
such Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a
secured party under the UCC or other applicable law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent
shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law,
to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral owned or held by or on
behalf of such Grantor, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on
any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the
Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall be
irrevocably authorized at any such sale of such Collateral constituting
securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective
bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are
purchasing such Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a
view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such
sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and
deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such
purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from
any claim or right on the part of the applicable Grantor, and such Grantor
hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay,
valuation and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the
future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.

                (b) SALE OF COLLATERAL. The Administrative Agent shall give each
Grantor ten days' written notice (which such Grantor agrees is reasonable notice
within the meaning of Sections 9-611




                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>


and 9-612 of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York or its equivalent in
other jurisdictions (or any successor provisions)), of the Administrative
Agent's intention to make any sale of any of the Collateral owned or held by or
on behalf of such Grantor. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall
state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's
board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which
such sale is to be made and the day on which such Collateral will first be
offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held
at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places
as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such
sale. At any such sale, the Collateral to be sold may be sold in one lot as an
entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole
and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so,
regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been
given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any
public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so
adjourned. In case any sale of any of the Collateral is made on credit or for
future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative
Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but
the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such
purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold
and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like
notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private)
sale made pursuant to this Section, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase,
free (to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any right of redemption,
stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of such Grantor (all said rights being
also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), any of the
Collateral offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any
claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from such Grantor as a credit
against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the
terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further
accountability to such Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, (i) a written
agreement to purchase any of the Collateral shall be treated as a sale thereof,
(ii) the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to
such agreement, and (iii) no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of any of
the Collateral subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the
Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of
Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an
alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the
Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to
foreclose upon any of the Collateral and to sell any of the Collateral pursuant
to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or
pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the
provisions of this Article shall be deemed to conform to the commercially
reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the UCC as in effect in
the State of New York or its equivalent in other jurisdictions (or any successor
provisions). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor
agrees as follows: (A) if the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral owned or
held by it or on its behalf pursuant to this Article are insufficient to pay all
the Obligations, it shall be liable for the resulting deficiency and the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel employed by the Administrative Agent or
any other Secured Party to collect such deficiency, (B) it hereby waives any
claims against the Administrative Agent arising by reason of the fact that the
price at which any such Collateral may have been sold at any private sale
pursuant to this Article was



                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>


less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the
Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such
Collateral to more than one offeree, (C) there is no adequate remedy at law for
failure by it to comply with the provisions of this Section and that such
failure would not be adequately compensible in damages, and therefore agrees
that its agreements in this Section may be specifically enforced, (D) the
Administrative Agent may sell any such Collateral without giving any warranties
as to such Collateral, and the Administrative Agent may specifically disclaim
any warranties of title or the like, and (E) the Administrative Agent shall have
no obligation to marshall any such Collateral.

    Section 6.2  APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF SALE

                The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any
collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of
cash (except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11 of the Credit Agreement,
Section 3.7(b)(v)), as follows:

                         FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
        expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such
        hereunder or under any other Loan Document) in connection with such
        collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Supplemental
        Security Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Obligations,
        including all out-of-pocket court costs and the reasonable fees and
        expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances
        made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan
        Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other reasonable out-of-pocket
        costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right
        or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

                         SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the
        amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata
        in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the
        date of any such distribution); and

                         THIRD, to the applicable Grantor, its successors or
        assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.

The Administrative Agent shall have sole and absolute discretion as to the time
of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this
Supplemental Security Agreement. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the
Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute
or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the
Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient
discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such
purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any
part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer
or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.

    Section 6.3  INVESTMENT RELATED PROPERTY

                In view of the position of each Grantor in relation to the
Investment Related Property, or because of other current or future
circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or
hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in
purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in
effect being called the "FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS") with respect to any
disposition of the Investment Related Property permitted hereunder. Each Grantor
understands that compliance with the Federal securities laws might very strictly
limit the course of conduct of the Administrative Agent if the Administrative
Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Investment Related
Property, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any
subsequent transferee of any Investment Related Property could dispose of the
same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting
the Administrative Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the
Investment Related Property under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities
laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Grantor recognizes
that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Administrative Agent may,
with respect to any sale of the Investment Related Property, limit the
purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such
Investment Related Property for their own account, for investment, and not with
a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and
agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Administrative
Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) may proceed to make such a sale
whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such
Investment Related Property, or any part thereof, shall have been filed under
the Federal securities laws and (ii) may approach and negotiate with a single
potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees
that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the
seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the
event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility
or liability for selling all or any part of the Investment Related Property at a
price that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in
good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the
possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the
sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a
single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section will apply
notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the
quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the
Administrative Agent sells any such Investment Related Property.

    Section 6.4  REGISTRATION, ETC.

                Each Grantor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, if for any reason the Administrative Agent
desires to sell any of the Investment Related Property owned or held by or on
behalf of such Grantor at a public sale, it will, at any time and from time to
time, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, use its best efforts
to take or to cause, where applicable, the issuer of such Investment Related
Property to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents,
as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the
Administrative Agent to permit the public sale of such Investment Related
Property. Each Grantor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each




                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

other Secured Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors,
affiliates and controlling Persons from and against all loss, liability,
expenses, costs of counsel (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel), and claims (including the costs of investigation) that they may incur,
insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim, as applicable, relates to
such Grantor or any of its property, and arises out of or is based upon any
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or
arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof
not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue
statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such
Grantor or the issuer of such Investment Related Property, as applicable, by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party expressly for use therein. Each
Grantor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its
best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause, where applicable, the
issuer of such Investment Related Property to qualify, file or register, any of
the Investment Related Property owned or held by or on behalf of such Grantor
under the Blue Sky or other securities laws of such states as may be requested
by the Administrative Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective,
all such qualifications, filings or registrations. Each Grantor will bear all
costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations under this Section. Each
Grantor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by it
to comply with the provisions of this Section and that such failure would not be
adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees that its agreements
contained in this Section may be specifically enforced.

ARTICLE 7. REIMBURSEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                Each Grantor agrees, jointly with the other Grantors and
severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent the amount of any and all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the fees, other charges and
disbursements of counsel and of any experts or agents, that the Administrative
Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this Supplemental
Security Agreement relating to such Grantor or any of its property, (ii) the
custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon, any of the Collateral owned or held by or on behalf of such
Grantor, (iii) the exercise, enforcement or protection of any of the rights of
the Administrative Agent hereunder relating to such Grantor or any of its
property, or (iv) the failure by such Grantor to perform or observe any of the
provisions hereof. Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under
the other Loan Documents, each of the Grantors agrees, jointly with the other
Grantors and severally, to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other
Indemnitees against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and related out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable counsel fees, other charges and disbursements, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as
a result of (a) the execution or delivery by such Grantor of this Supplemental
Security Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, or the performance by such Grantor of its
obligations under the Loan Documents and the other transactions contemplated
thereby or (b) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, PROVIDED
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and




                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee. Any amounts payable as provided hereunder shall
be additional Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents.
The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in full force and
effect regardless of the termination of this Supplemental Security Agreement or
any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any term or provision of this Supplemental Security
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party. All amounts due under
this Section shall be payable within ten days of written demand therefor and
shall bear interest at the rate specified in Section 3.1 of the Credit
Agreement.

ARTICLE 8.   WAIVERS; AMENDMENT

        No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent in exercising any power
or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of
this Supplemental Security Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to
any departure by any Grantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be permitted by this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on any Grantor in any case shall entitle such Grantor
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Neither this Supplemental Security Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, or any departure therefrom
consented to, except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by, between or among the Administrative Agent and the Grantor or Grantors
with respect to which such waiver, amendment, other modification or consent is
to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 10.2 of the
Credit Agreement.

ARTICLE 9.   SECURITY INTEREST ABSOLUTE

                All rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Security
Interest and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and
unconditional irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the
Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of
the Obligations, or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the
foregoing, (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other waiver, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or any consent to any departure from, the
Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
relating to any of the foregoing, (iii) any exchange, release or non-perfection
of any Lien on any other collateral, or any release or waiver, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or consent under, or departure from, any
guaranty, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (iv) any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Obligations or in respect of this
Supplemental Security Agreement or any other Loan Document.

<PAGE>

ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION; RELEASE

                This Supplemental Security Agreement and the Security Interest
shall terminate when all the Obligations have been finally and indefeasibly paid
in full in cash, the Credit Parties have no further commitment to lend or
otherwise extend credit under the Credit Agreement. Upon (i) any sale, transfer
or other disposition permitted by the Loan Documents (other than any sale,
transfer or other disposition of any Collateral that would, immediately after
giving effect thereto, continue to be Collateral but for the release of the
security interest therein pursuant to this clause) or (ii) the effectiveness of
any written consent to the release of the Security Interest in any Collateral
pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement, the Security Interest in such
Collateral shall be automatically released. In connection with any termination
or release pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall execute and
deliver to the applicable Grantor, at its own cost and expense, all UCC
termination statements and similar documents that such Grantor may reasonably
request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of
documents pursuant to this Article shall be without recourse to or warranty by
the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party.

ARTICLE 11. ADDITIONAL GRANTORS

                Upon execution and delivery after the date hereof by the
Administrative Agent and a Subsidiary of a Supplement, such Subsidiary or
subsidiary, as applicable, shall become a Grantor hereunder with the same force
and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein (each an "ADDITIONAL
GRANTOR"). The execution and delivery of any Supplement shall not require the
consent of any other Grantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each
Grantor hereunder and each other Loan Party and other party (other than a Credit
Party) under the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the addition of any Additional Grantor as a party to this
Supplemental Security Agreement.

ARTICLE 12. NOTICES

                All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and
given as provided in Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement. All communications
and notices hereunder to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be given
to it at its address for notices set forth in such Section, and all
communications and notices hereunder to any other Grantor shall be given to it
at its address for notices set forth on Schedule I hereto or to the applicable
Supplement, with, in the case of any Grantor other than the Borrower, a copy to
the Borrower.

ARTICLE 13. BINDING EFFECT; SEVERAL AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS

                Whenever in this Supplemental Security Agreement any of the
parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the
successors and assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises and agreements
by or on behalf of any Grantor that are contained in this Supplemental Security
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and its
successors and assigns. This Supplemental Security Agreement shall become
effective as to any Grantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such
Grantor shall have been delivered to the




                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>


Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf
of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Grantor
and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and
shall inure to the benefit of such Grantor, the Administrative Agent and the
other Secured Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that
no Grantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or
any interest herein or in any of the Collateral (and any such attempted
assignment shall be void), except as expressly contemplated by this Supplemental
Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents. This Supplemental Security
Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each of the
Grantors and may be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or
released with respect to any Grantor without the approval of any other Grantor
and without affecting the obligations of any other Grantor hereunder.

ARTICLE 14. SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY

                All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
by the Grantors herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Supplemental Security Agreement
or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and shall survive the
execution and delivery of any Loan Document and the making of any Loan,
regardless of any investigation made by the Secured Parties or on their behalf,
and shall continue in full force and effect until this Supplemental Security
Agreement shall terminate. In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Supplemental Security Agreement or in any other Loan Document
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being
understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in
any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

ARTICLE 15. GOVERNING LAW

        THIS SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

ARTICLE 16. COUNTERPARTS

        This Supplemental Security Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute
but one contract (subject to Article 13), and shall become effective as provided
in Article 13. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Supplemental Security
Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Supplemental Security Agreement.

ARTICLE 17. HEADINGS

        Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are
for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Supplemental Security
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Supplemental Security Agreement.

ARTICLE 18. JURISDICTION; VENUE; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS

                Each Grantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City,
and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Supplemental Security Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Supplemental Security
Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Supplemental Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents against such
Grantor or any of its property in the courts of any jurisdiction. Each Grantor
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Supplemental Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents in
any foregoing court referred to in this Article. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Article 12. Nothing in this
Supplemental Security Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

ARTICLE 19. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS SUPPLEMENTAL
SECURITY AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS ARTICLE.

                       TO SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT

                               FORM OF SUPPLEMENT
                               ------------------

        SUPPLEMENT NO. __, dated as of           , to the SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY
AGREEMENT, dated as of March 8, 2002, among PENTON MEDIA, INC, a Delaware
corporation (the "BORROWER"), the subsidiaries of the Borrower party thereto,
and THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as administrative agent under the Credit Agreement
referred to in the next paragraph (as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT").

        Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as
of March 8, 2002, among the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto, Bank of
America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Bank One, NA (formerly known as The First
National Bank of Chicago), as Documentation Agent, Fleet National Bank, as
Co-Syndication Agent, and The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "CREDIT
AGREEMENT"). Capitalized terms (and the term "subsidiary") used herein and not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit
Agreement and the Supplemental Security Agreement.

        The Grantors have entered into the Supplemental Security Agreement in
order to induce the Credit Parties to enter into the Credit Agreement. Article
11 of the Supplemental Security Agreement provides that additional Subsidiaries
may become Grantors under the Supplemental Security Agreement by execution and
delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement. The undersigned
Subsidiary (the "NEW GRANTOR") is executing this Supplement in accordance with
the requirements of the Credit Agreement to become a Grantor under the
Supplemental Security Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make
additional Loans and as consideration for Loans previously made.

        Accordingly, the Administrative Agent and the New Grantor hereby agree
as follows:

         Section 1. In accordance with Article 11 of the Supplemental Security
Agreement, the New Grantor by its signature below becomes a Grantor under the
Supplemental Security Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally
named therein as a Grantor, and the New Grantor hereby agrees to all the terms
and provisions of the Supplemental Security Agreement applicable to it as a
Grantor thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New Grantor, as
security for the payment and performance in full of the Obligations, does hereby
create and grant to the Administrative Agent (and its successors and assigns),
for the benefit of the Secured Parties (and their successors and assigns), a
security interest in and lien on all of the New Grantor's right, title and
interest in and to the Collateral (as defined in the Supplemental Security
Agreement) owned or held by or on behalf of the New Grantor. Each reference to a
"Grantor" in the Supplemental Security Agreement shall be deemed to include the
New Grantor. The Supplemental Security Agreement is hereby incorporated herein
by reference.

         Section 2. The New Grantor represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties that (i) this Supplement has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it


<PAGE>


and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, (ii) set forth on the Schedules attached hereto are true and complete
schedules of all of the information that would have been required to have been
delivered by or on behalf of the New Grantor pursuant to the Supplemental
Security Agreement and the Schedules thereto if the New Grantor had been
originally named in the Supplemental Security Agreement, and (iii) the
representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor under the Supplemental
Security Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date hereof based upon
the applicable information referred to in clause (ii) of this Section.

         Section 3. This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by each
party hereto on a different counterpart), each of which shall constitute an
original, but both of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one
contract. This Supplement shall become effective when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken together,
bear the signatures of the New Grantor and the Administrative Agent. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of this Supplement by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Supplement.

         Section 4. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Supplemental
Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

         Section 5. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         Section 6. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Supplement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein and in the Supplemental Security Agreement shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself
affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties
hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

         Section 7. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing
and given as provided in Article 12 of the Supplemental Security Agreement. All
communications and notices hereunder to the New Grantor shall be given to it at
the address set forth in the applicable Schedule hereto, with a copy to the
Borrower.

         Section 8. The New Grantor agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent
for its out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this Supplement, including the
fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel for the Administrative Agent.

         Section 11. CHOICE OF LAW

                This Deposit Account Control Agreement and the Deposit Account

Depository Institution's jurisdiction (within the meaning of Section 9-304 of
the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time (including any
successor thereto) in the State of New York), and the Deposit Account shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New

Control Agreement.

         Section 13. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DEPOSIT
ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS DEPOSIT ACCOUNT CONTROL
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.

         Section 14. MISCELLANEOUS

                         (a)     This Deposit Account Control Agreement does
not create any obligation or duty of the Depository Institution other than those
expressly set forth herein.

                         (b)     No amendment, supplement or other modification
of this Deposit Account Control Agreement, or any waiver of any right hereunder,
shall be binding on any party to this Deposit Account Control Agreement, unless
it is in writing and signed by each of the parties to this Deposit Account
Control Agreement.

                         (c) Section headings have been inserted in this
Deposit Account Control Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Deposit
Account Control Agreement.

                         (d) In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Deposit Account Control Agreement should be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself
affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

                         (e) The provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby.

                         (f) This Deposit Account Control Agreement and the
exhibits hereto constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

OF TERMINATION"), or (b) delivery by the Securities Intermediary of all of the

         Section 13. CHOICE OF LAW

                This Securities Account Control Agreement and the Securities
Account shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of New York. Regardless of any other provision in any other agreement, for
purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, the State of New York shall be deemed
to be the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction (within the meaning of Section
8-110 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time (including
any successor thereto) in the State of New York), and the Securities Account (as
well as the security entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard

counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together,
shall constitute but one contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this
Securities Account Control Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Securities
Account Control Agreement.

         Section 15. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
SECURITIES ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF




                                       9
<PAGE>

ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS SECURITIES ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         Section 16. MISCELLANEOUS

                         (a)     This Securities Account Control Agreement does
not create any obligation or duty of the Securities Intermediary other than
those expressly set forth herein.

                         (b)     No amendment, supplement or modification of
this Securities Account Control Agreement, or any waiver of any right hereunder,
shall be binding on any party to this Securities Account Control Agreement
unless it is in writing and signed by each of the parties to this Securities
Account Control Agreement.

                         (c)     Section headings have been inserted in this
Securities Account Control Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect
the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this
Securities Account Control Agreement.

                         (d)     In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Securities Account Control Agreement should be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself
affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

                         (e)     The provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby.

                         (f)      This Securities Account Control Agreement and
the exhibits hereto constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to
the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

        I. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Security Agreement.

        II. The Borrower has requested that the Administrative Agent and the
Required Lenders agree to amend the Security Agreement upon the terms and
conditions contained in this Amendment, and the Administrative Agent and the
Required Lenders are willing so to agree.

        Accordingly, in consideration of the Recitals and the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

        1. Section 1(b) of the Security Agreement is hereby amended by inserting
the following defined terms therein in appropriate alphabetical order:

                "CASH MANAGEMENT SERVICES" means treasury, depository and other
        cash management services and/or automated clearing house transfers of
        funds.

                "DESIGNATED CASH MANAGER" means, during the period beginning on
        the fifth Business Day following the date upon which the Administrative
        Agent and the Lenders receive a Notice of Designation (the "INITIAL
        NOTICE") and ending on the fourth Business Day following the date upon
        which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders receive a subsequent
        Notice of Designation, the Lender (and its Affiliates) designated as
        such in the Initial Notice; PROVIDED that KeyBank, National Association
        (and its Affiliates) shall be deemed to be the Designated Cash Manager
        until the fourth Business Day following the date, if any, upon which the
        Administrative Agent and the Lenders receive a Notice of Designation
        designating another Lender as the Designated Cash Manager.

                "LEISUREHUB" means, Leisurehub.com Ltd., a company organized
        under the laws of England.

                "PENTON MEDIA FRANCE" means, Penton Media France SAS, a company
        organized under the laws of France.




<PAGE>


                "NOTICE OF DESIGNATION" means any written notice delivered by
        the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that expressly
        designates one of the Lenders as the Designated Cash Manager.

        2. The defined term "Obligations" contained in Section 1 of the Security
Agreement is hereby amended by (i) replacing the word "and" appearing
immediately prior to clause (c) of such definition with a comma, and (ii)
inserting the following immediately prior to the period appearing at the end of
such definition:

        ", and (d) except to the extent otherwise agreed upon in writing by a
        Lender, all obligations of the Borrower, monetary or otherwise, in
        respect of any overdrafts and/or other liabilities for Cash Management
        Services rendered to the Borrower by such Lender at the time such Lender
        was the Designated Cash Manager ("CASH MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS"),
        PROVIDED that (i) Cash Management Obligations in excess of $2,000,000
        outstanding at any one time ("EXCESS CASH MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS") shall
        conclusively be deemed not to be "Obligations", and (ii) in determining
        which such Cash Management Obligations, if any, constitute Excess Cash
        Management Obligations, priority shall be given to Cash Management
        Obligations that are first in time (E.G., such that the Cash Management
        Obligations that were later in time shall be deemed to be Excess Cash
        Management Obligations).

        3. The defined term "Secured Parties" contained in Section 1 of the
Security Agreement is hereby amended by (i) replacing the phrase "and (d)"
appearing on the last line of such definition with the phrase "and (e)", and
(ii) inserting the following new clause (d) immediately after clause (c) of such
definition:

           ", (d) at any time, each Lender (and its Affiliates) holding Cash
        Management Obligations that do not constitute Excess Cash Management
        Obligations,"

        4. The following term contained in Section 1 of the Security Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

        "PLEDGED EQUITY" means, with respect to any Grantor, all right, title
        and interest of such Grantor in any Equity Interests (other than the
        Equity Interests of ComMunic, Leisurehub (provided that Leisurehub is
        dissolved by no later than July 15, 2002) and Penton Media France),
        whether now or hereafter acquired or arising in the future, PROVIDED
        that "Pledged Equity" shall not include any outstanding capital stock of
        a "controlled foreign corporation" as defined in the Code in excess of
        65% of the voting power of all classes of capital stock of such
        corporation entitled to vote.

        5. On and as of the date hereof, each Loan Party hereby (a) reaffirms
and admits the validity and enforceability of the Loan Documents and all of its
obligations thereunder, (b) agrees and admits that it has no defenses to or
offsets against any such obligation, except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Loan Documents, and (c) represents and warrants that no Event of Default has
occurred




                                     - 2 -

and is continuing, and each of the representations and warranties made by it in
the Loan Documents is true and correct with the same effect as though such
representation and warranty had been made on such date, except representations
and warranties made only as of a specific date, which such Loan Party reaffirms
were true and correct as of such date.

        6. In all other respects the Security Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and no amendment in respect of any term or condition of the
Security Agreement contained herein shall be deemed to be an amendment in
respect of any other term or condition contained in any Loan Document.

        7. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts all of
which, taken together, shall constitute one Amendment. In making proof of this
Amendment, it shall only be necessary to produce the counterpart executed and
delivered by the party to be charged.

        8. THIS AMENDMENT IS BEING EXECUTED AND DELIVERED IN, AND IS INTENDED TO
BE PERFORMED IN, THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCEABLE IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICT OF LAWS.

                (b)  COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS. Each Grantor hereby covenants and
agrees as follows:

                         (i) It will promptly notify the Administrative Agent in
        writing of any change (A) in its legal name or in any trade name used to
        identify it in the conduct of its business or in the ownership of its
        properties, (B) in the location of its chief executive office, principal
        place of business, any office in which it maintains books or records
        relating to any of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf
        or, except to the extent permitted by Section 3.1(b)(vii) or Section
        3.2, any office or facility at which any such Collateral is located
        (including the establishment of any such new office or facility), (C) in
        its identity or legal or organizational structure or its jurisdiction of
        formation, or (D) in its Federal Taxpayer Identification Number. It
        agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in the preceding
        sentence unless all filings have been made under the UCC or otherwise
        that are required in order for the Administrative Agent to continue at
        all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected
        security interest in all the Collateral with the priority required
        hereby.

                         (ii) It shall maintain, at its own cost and expense,
        such complete and accurate Records with respect to the Collateral owned
        or held by it or on its behalf as is consistent with its current
        practices and in accordance with such prudent and standard practices
        used in industries that are the same as or similar to those in which it
        is engaged, but in any event to include complete accounting Records
        indicating all payments and proceeds received with respect to any part
        of such Collateral, and, at such time or times as the Administrative
        Agent may reasonably request, promptly to prepare and deliver to the
        Administrative Agent a duly certified schedule or schedules in form and
        detail satisfactory to the Administrative Agent showing the identity and
        amount of any and all such Collateral.

                         (iii) It shall, at its own cost and expense, take any
        and all actions necessary to defend title to the Collateral owned or
        held by it or on its behalf against all Persons and to defend the
        Security Interest in such Collateral and the priority thereof against
        any Lien or other interest not expressly permitted by the Loan
        Documents, and in furtherance thereof, it shall not take, or permit to
        be taken, any action not otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan
        Documents that could impair the Security Interest or the priority
        thereof or any Secured Party's rights in or to such Collateral.

                (iv) The Administrative Agent and such Persons as the
Administrative Agent may designate shall have the right, at the cost and expense
of such Grantor, to inspect all of its Records (and to make extracts and copies
from such Records), to discuss its affairs with its officers and independent
accountants and to verify under reasonable procedures the validity, amount,
quality, quantity, value, condition and status of, or any other matter relating
to, the Collateral owned or held by or on behalf of such Grantor, including, in
the case of Collateral in the possession of any third person, by contacting
contract parties or other obligors thereon or any third person possessing such
Collateral for the purpose of making such a verification. The Administrative
Agent shall have the absolute right to share on a confidential basis any
information it gains from such inspection or verification with any Secured
Party.

                (v) At its option, the Administrative Agent may discharge past
due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other
encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral owned or held by or
on behalf of such Grantor, and not permitted by the Loan Documents, and may pay
for the maintenance and preservation of such Collateral to the extent such
Grantor fails to do so as required by the Loan Documents, and such Grantor
agrees, jointly with the other Grantors and severally, to reimburse the
Administrative Agent on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any
Grantor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to cure or perform, any
covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes, assessments,
charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance
as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.

                (vi) It shall remain liable to observe and perform all the
conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each
contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral owned or held by it
or on its behalf, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and
it agrees, jointly with the other Grantors and severally, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties from and against
any and all liability for such performance.

                (vii) It shall not make, or permit to be made, an assignment,
pledge or hypothecation of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf,
or grant any other Lien in respect of such Collateral, except as expressly
permitted by the Loan Documents. Except for Liens expressly permitted by the
Loan Documents, it shall not make or permit to be made any transfer of such
Collateral, and it shall remain at all times in possession of such Collateral,
except that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall notify it that an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and that, during the
continuance thereof, it shall not sell, convey, lease, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any such Collateral (which notice may be given by telephone
if promptly confirmed in writing), it may use and dispose of such Collateral in
any lawful manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Supplemental
Security Agreement or any other Loan Document.

held by or on behalf of such Grantor.

                (b) REGISTRATION IN NOMINEE NAME; DENOMINATIONS. Each Grantor
hereby agrees that (i) without limiting Article 5, the Administrative Agent, on
behalf of the Secured Parties, shall have the right (in its sole and absolute
discretion) to hold any Investment Related Property in its own name as pledgee,
the name of its nominee (as pledgee or as sub-agent) or the name of the
applicable Grantor, endorsed or assigned, where applicable, in blank or in favor
of the Administrative Agent, (ii) at the Administrative Agent's request, such
Grantor will promptly give to the Administrative Agent copies of any material
notices or other communications received by it with respect to any Investment
Related Property registered in its name, and (iii) the Administrative Agent
shall at all times have the right to exchange any certificates, instruments or
other documents representing or evidencing any Investment Related Property owned
or held by or on behalf of such Grantor for certificates, instruments or other
documents of smaller or larger denominations for any purpose consistent with
this Supplemental Security Agreement.

                (c)  VOTING AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

                         (i)    Unless and until an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing:

                                 (A)     Each Grantor shall be entitled to
        exercise any and all voting and/or other consensual rights and powers
        inuring to an owner of the Investment Related Property, or any part
        thereof, for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Supplemental
        Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
        such Grantor will not be entitled to exercise any such right if the
        result thereof could materially and adversely affect the rights inuring
        to a holder of the Investment Related Property or the rights and
        remedies of any of the Secured Parties under this Supplemental Security
        Agreement or any other Loan Document or the ability of any of the
        Secured Parties to exercise the same.

                                 (B)     The Administrative Agent shall execute
        and deliver to each Grantor, or cause to be executed and delivered to
        each Grantor, all such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments
        as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling it to
        exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled
        to exercise pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(A) and to receive the cash
        payments it is entitled to receive pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(C).

                                 (C)     Each Grantor shall be entitled to
        receive, retain and use any and all cash dividends, interest and
        principal paid on the Investment Related Property owned or held by it or
        on its behalf to the extent and only to the extent that such cash
        dividends, interest and

                                      - 8 -

<PAGE>

principal are not prohibited by, and otherwise paid in accordance with, the
terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and
applicable laws. All non-cash dividends, interest and principal, and all
dividends, interest and principal paid or payable in cash or otherwise in
connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of
capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other
than distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect
of the Investment Related Property, whether paid or payable in cash or
otherwise, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification
of the outstanding securities of any issuer of any Investment Related Property
or received in exchange for any Investment Related Property, or any part
thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation,
acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or
otherwise, shall be and become part of the Collateral, and, if received by such
Grantor, shall not be commingled with any of its other funds or property but
shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent hereunder and shall be forthwith delivered
to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement).

                (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:

                         (A)     All rights of each Grantor to dividends,
interest or principal that it is authorized to receive pursuant to subsection
(c)(i)(C) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the
Administrative Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and
authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest or principal, as
applicable. All dividends, interest and principal received by or on behalf of
any Grantor contrary to the provisions of this Section shall be held in trust
for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other
property or funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith delivered to the
Administrative Agent upon demand in the same form as so received (with any
necessary endorsement). Any and all money and other property paid over to or
received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection (c)(ii)(A) shall be retained by the Administrative Agent in an
account to be established in the name of the Administrative Agent, for the
ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, upon receipt of such money or other
property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2.
Subject to the provisions of this subsection (c)(ii)(A), such account shall at
all times be under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent,
and the Administrative Agent shall at all times have the sole right to make
withdrawals therefrom and to exercise all rights with respect to the funds and
other property from time to time therein or credited thereto as set forth in the
Loan Documents. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, the
Administrative Agent shall, within five Business Days after all such Events of
Default have been cured or waived, repay to the applicable Grantor all cash
dividends, interest and principal (without interest) that such Grantor would
otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of subsection (c)(i)(C)
and which remain in such account.

<PAGE>

                                 (B)     All rights of each Grantor to exercise
        the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise
        pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(A), and the obligations of the
        Administrative Agent under subsection (c)(i)(B), shall cease, and all
        such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent,
        which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise
        such voting and consensual rights and powers, PROVIDED that, unless
        otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
        shall have the right from time to time following and during the
        continuance of an Event of Default to permit such Grantor to exercise
        such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, the
        applicable Grantor will have the right to exercise the voting and
        consensual rights and powers that it would otherwise be entitled to
        exercise pursuant to the terms of subsection (c)(i)(A).

                (d) CASH AND INVESTMENT PROPERTY. Each Grantor covenants and
agrees that (i) with respect to each of its Deposit Accounts existing on the
date hereof and set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, it shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to the Administrative Agent, by no later than April 15, 2002, a
duly executed Deposit Account Control Agreement with respect to each such
Deposit Account (other than a Deposit Account that at all times has less than
(A) $25,000 on deposit therein, and (B) when aggregated with all other Deposit
Accounts that are not subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement in favor of
the Administrative Agent, $100,000 on deposit therein), (ii) it shall not at any
time establish or maintain any other Deposit Account without first delivering to
the Administrative Agent a duly executed Deposit Account Control Agreement with
respect to such Deposit Account, (iii) with respect to each of its Securities
Accounts existing on the date hereof and set forth in Schedule 3.2 hereto, it
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Administrative Agent, by no
later than April 15, 2002, a duly executed Securities Account Control Agreement
with respect to each such Securities Account, (iv) it shall not at any time
establish or maintain any other Securities Account without first delivering to
the Administrative Agent a duly executed Securities Account Control Agreement
with respect to such Securities Account, and (v) it shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, no less frequently than every other Business Day all of its
Investment Related Property (other than Deposit Accounts and Securities
Accounts) into one or more such Deposit Accounts or Securities Accounts. Prior
to the delivery of a "Notice of Exclusive Control" under the applicable Control
Agreement, and pursuant to the terms thereof and the other Loan Documents, each
Deposit Account and/or Securities Account shall at all times be under the
"control" (within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC) of the Administrative
Agent or an agent of the Administrative Agent, and no Grantor shall have access
to or any right to draw upon or withdraw any cash or other funds therefrom,
except for purposes not otherwise prohibited by the Loan Documents.

ARTICLE 4.   FURTHER ASSURANCES

                Each Grantor hereby covenants and agrees, at its own cost and
expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and/or cause to be duly filed all such
further agreements, instruments and other documents (including favorable legal
opinions in connection with any Transaction), and take all such further actions,
that the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably request to
preserve, protect and perfect (including as a result of any revisions to Article
9 of the UCC in any jurisdiction or the effectiveness thereof or any other
change in applicable law) the Security Interest granted by it and

                                     - 10 -

<PAGE>

the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and
taxes required in connection with its execution and delivery of this
Supplemental Security Agreement, the granting by it of the Security Interest and
the filing of any financing statements or other documents in connection herewith
or therewith. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to file one or
more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to
all or any part of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf without
the signature of such Grantor and agrees that a photographic or other
reproduction of this Supplemental Security Agreement or of a financing statement
signed by such Grantor shall be sufficient as a financing statement and may be
filed as a financing statement in any and all jurisdictions. Each Grantor hereby
further irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to file a Record or
Records, including financing statements, in all jurisdictions and with all
filing offices that the Administrative Agent may determine, in its sole and
absolute discretion, are necessary, advisable or prudent to perfect the Security
Interest granted by it and agrees that such financing statements may describe
the Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf in the same manner as
described herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral that
describes such Collateral in any other manner that the Administrative Agent may
determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, is necessary, advisable or
prudent to perfect the Security Interest granted by such Grantor, including
describing such property as "all assets" or "all personal property."

ARTICLE 5.    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT

                Each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as its
true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of carrying out the
provisions of this Supplemental Security Agreement and taking any action and
executing any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable
and coupled with an interest, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, with power of
substitution for such Grantor and in such Grantor's name or otherwise, for the
use and benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and at such
other time or times permitted by the Loan Documents, (i) to receive, endorse,
assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money
orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral owned or held by
it or on its behalf or any part thereof; (ii) to demand, collect, receive
payment of, give receipt for, and give discharges and releases of, any of such
Collateral; (iii) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or
proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to
collect or otherwise realize on any of the Collateral owned or held by it or on
its behalf or to enforce any rights in respect of any of such Collateral; (iv)
to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or
proceedings relating to any of such Collateral; (v) to notify, or to require
such Grantor to notify, obligors to make payment directly to the Administrative
Agent, and (vi) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with
respect to or otherwise deal with any of such Collateral, and to do all other
acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Supplemental
Security Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent
were the absolute owner of such Collateral for all purposes; PROVIDED, however,
that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any commitment or to
make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency

                                     - 11 -

<PAGE>

of any payment received by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party,
or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to
any of the Collateral or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or
any property covered thereby, and no action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party with respect to any of the
Collateral shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in favor of
such Grantor or to any claim or action against the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party. The provisions of this Article shall in no event relieve
any Grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents with respect to any of the Collateral or impose any obligation on the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to proceed in any particular
manner with respect to any of the Collateral, or in any way limit the exercise
by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any other or further
right that it may have on the date of this Supplemental Security Agreement or
hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other Loan Document, by law or
otherwise. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed
to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section
9-610(b) of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York or its equivalent in
other jurisdictions (or any successor provision).

ARTICLE 6.   REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

    Section 6.1 REMEDIES GENERALLY

                (a) GENERAL RIGHTS. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of
Collateral owned or held by it or on its behalf to the Administrative Agent on
demand, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right,
with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for
performance, to take possession of the Collateral owned or held by it or on its
behalf and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where such
Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing
such Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a
secured party under the UCC or other applicable law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent
shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law,
to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral owned or held by or on
behalf of such Grantor, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on
any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the
Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall be
irrevocably authorized at any such sale of such Collateral constituting
securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective
bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are
purchasing such Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a
view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such
sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and
deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such
purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from
any claim or right on the part of the applicable Grantor, and such Grantor
hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay,
valuation and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the
future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.

                (b) SALE OF COLLATERAL. The Administrative Agent shall give each
Grantor ten days' written notice (which such Grantor agrees is reasonable notice
within the meaning of Sections 9-611

                                     - 12 -

<PAGE>
and 9-612 of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York or its equivalent in
other jurisdictions (or any successor provisions)), of the Administrative
Agent's intention to make any sale of any of the Collateral owned or held by or
on behalf of such Grantor. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall
state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's
board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which
such sale is to be made and the day on which such Collateral will first be
offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held
at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places
as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such
sale. At any such sale, the Collateral to be sold may be sold in one lot as an
entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole
and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be
obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so,
regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been
given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any
public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so
adjourned. In case any sale of any of the Collateral is made on credit or for
future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative
Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but
the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such
purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold
and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like
notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private)
sale made pursuant to this Section, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase,
free (to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any right of redemption,
stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of such Grantor (all said rights being
also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), any of the
Collateral offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any
claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from such Grantor as a credit
against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the
terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further
accountability to such Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, (i) a written
agreement to purchase any of the Collateral shall be treated as a sale thereof,
(ii) the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to
such agreement, and (iii) no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of any of
the Collateral subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the
Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of
Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an
alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the
Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to
foreclose upon any of the Collateral and to sell any of the Collateral pursuant
to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or
pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the
provisions of this Article shall be deemed to conform to the commercially
reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the UCC as in effect in
the State of New York or its equivalent in other jurisdictions (or any successor
provisions). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor
agrees as follows: (A) if the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral owned or
held by it or on its behalf pursuant to this Article are insufficient to pay all
the Obligations, it shall be liable for the resulting deficiency and the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel employed by the Administrative Agent or
any other Secured Party to collect such deficiency, (B) it hereby waives any
claims against the Administrative Agent arising by reason of the fact that the
price at which any such Collateral may have been sold at any private sale
pursuant to this Article was


                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>


less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the
Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such
Collateral to more than one offeree, (C) there is no adequate remedy at law for
failure by it to comply with the provisions of this Section and that such
failure would not be adequately compensible in damages, and therefore agrees
that its agreements in this Section may be specifically enforced, (D) the
Administrative Agent may sell any such Collateral without giving any warranties
as to such Collateral, and the Administrative Agent may specifically disclaim
any warranties of title or the like, and (E) the Administrative Agent shall have
no obligation to marshall any such Collateral.

    Section 6.2 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF SALE

                The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any
collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of
cash (except as otherwise provided in Section 6.11 of the Credit Agreement,
Section 3.7(b)(v)), as follows:

                         FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
        expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such
        hereunder or under any other Loan Document) in connection with such
        collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Supplemental
        Security Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Obligations,
        including all out-of-pocket court costs and the reasonable fees and
        expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances
        made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan
        Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other reasonable out-of-pocket
        costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right
        or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

                         SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the
        amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata
        in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the
        date of any such distribution); and

                         THIRD, to the applicable Grantor, its successors or
        assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.

The Administrative Agent shall have sole and absolute discretion as to the time
of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this
Supplemental Security Agreement. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the
Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute
or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the
Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient
discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such
purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any
part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer
or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.

                                     - 14 -

    Section 6.3 INVESTMENT RELATED PROPERTY

                In view of the position of each Grantor in relation to the
Investment Related Property, or because of other current or future
circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or
hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in
purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in
effect being called the "FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS") with respect to any
disposition of the Investment Related Property permitted hereunder. Each Grantor
understands that compliance with the Federal securities laws might very strictly
limit the course of conduct of the Administrative Agent if the Administrative
Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Investment Related
Property, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any
subsequent transferee of any Investment Related Property could dispose of the
same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting
the Administrative Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the
Investment Related Property under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities
laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Grantor recognizes
that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Administrative Agent may,
with respect to any sale of the Investment Related Property, limit the
purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such
Investment Related Property for their own account, for investment, and not with
a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and
agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Administrative
Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) may proceed to make such a sale
whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such
Investment Related Property, or any part thereof, shall have been filed under
the Federal securities laws and (ii) may approach and negotiate with a single
potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees
that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the
seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the
event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility
or liability for selling all or any part of the Investment Related Property at a
price that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in
good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the
possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the
sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a
single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section will apply
notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the
quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the
Administrative Agent sells any such Investment Related Property.

    Section 6.4 REGISTRATION, ETC.

                Each Grantor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, if for any reason the Administrative Agent
desires to sell any of the Investment Related Property owned or held by or on
behalf of such Grantor at a public sale, it will, at any time and from time to
time, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, use its best efforts
to take or to cause, where applicable, the issuer of such Investment Related
Property to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents,
as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the
Administrative Agent to permit the public sale of such Investment Related
Property. Each Grantor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each


                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>


other Secured Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors,
affiliates and controlling Persons from and against all loss, liability,
expenses, costs of counsel (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel), and claims (including the costs of investigation) that they may incur,
insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim, as applicable, relates to
such Grantor or any of its property, and arises out of or is based upon any
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or
arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof
not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue
statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such
Grantor or the issuer of such Investment Related Property, as applicable, by the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party expressly for use therein. Each
Grantor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its
best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause, where applicable, the
issuer of such Investment Related Property to qualify, file or register, any of
the Investment Related Property owned or held by or on behalf of such Grantor
under the Blue Sky or other securities laws of such states as may be requested
by the Administrative Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective,
all such qualifications, filings or registrations. Each Grantor will bear all
costs and expenses of carrying out its obligations under this Section. Each
Grantor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by it
to comply with the provisions of this Section and that such failure would not be
adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees that its agreements
contained in this Section may be specifically enforced.

ARTICLE 7.   REIMBURSEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                Each Grantor agrees, jointly with the other Grantors and
severally, to pay to the Administrative Agent the amount of any and all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the fees, other charges and
disbursements of counsel and of any experts or agents, that the Administrative
Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this Supplemental
Security Agreement relating to such Grantor or any of its property, (ii) the
custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other
realization upon, any of the Collateral owned or held by or on behalf of such
Grantor, (iii) the exercise, enforcement or protection of any of the rights of
the Administrative Agent hereunder relating to such Grantor or any of its
property, or (iv) the failure by such Grantor to perform or observe any of the
provisions hereof. Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under
the other Loan Documents, each of the Grantors agrees, jointly with the other
Grantors and severally, to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other
Indemnitees against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and related out-of-pocket expenses, including
reasonable counsel fees, other charges and disbursements, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as
a result of (a) the execution or delivery by such Grantor of this Supplemental
Security Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, or the performance by such Grantor of its
obligations under the Loan Documents and the other transactions contemplated
thereby or (b) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, PROVIDED
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and


                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>


nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee. Any amounts payable as provided hereunder shall
be additional Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents.
The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in full force and
effect regardless of the termination of this Supplemental Security Agreement or
any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any term or provision of this Supplemental Security
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party. All amounts due under
this Section shall be payable within ten days of written demand therefor and
shall bear interest at the rate specified in Section 3.1 of the Credit
Agreement.

ARTICLE 8.   WAIVERS; AMENDMENT

        No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent in exercising any power
or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of
this Supplemental Security Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to
any departure by any Grantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be permitted by this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on any Grantor in any case shall entitle such Grantor
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Neither this Supplemental Security Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, or any departure therefrom
consented to, except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by, between or among the Administrative Agent and the Grantor or Grantors
with respect to which such waiver, amendment, other modification or consent is
to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 10.2 of the
Credit Agreement.

ARTICLE 9.   SECURITY INTEREST ABSOLUTE

                All rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Security
Interest and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and
unconditional irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the
Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of
the Obligations, or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the
foregoing, (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other waiver, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or any consent to any departure from, the
Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
relating to any of the foregoing, (iii) any exchange, release or non-perfection
of any Lien on any other collateral, or any release or waiver, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or consent under, or departure from, any
guaranty, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (iv) any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Obligations or in respect of this
Supplemental Security Agreement or any other Loan Document.

ARTICLE 10. TERMINATION; RELEASE

                This Supplemental Security Agreement and the Security Interest
shall terminate when all the Obligations have been finally and indefeasibly paid
in full in cash, the Credit Parties have no further commitment to lend or
otherwise extend credit under the Credit Agreement. Upon (i) any sale, transfer
or other disposition permitted by the Loan Documents (other than any sale,
transfer or other disposition of any Collateral that would, immediately after
giving effect thereto, continue to be Collateral but for the release of the
security interest therein pursuant to this clause) or (ii) the effectiveness of
any written consent to the release of the Security Interest in any Collateral
pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement, the Security Interest in such
Collateral shall be automatically released. In connection with any termination
or release pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall execute and
deliver to the applicable Grantor, at its own cost and expense, all UCC
termination statements and similar documents that such Grantor may reasonably
request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of
documents pursuant to this Article shall be without recourse to or warranty by
the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party.

ARTICLE 11. ADDITIONAL GRANTORS

                Upon execution and delivery after the date hereof by the
Administrative Agent and a Subsidiary of a Supplement, such Subsidiary or
subsidiary, as applicable, shall become a Grantor hereunder with the same force
and effect as if originally named as a Grantor herein (each an "Additional
Grantor"). The execution and delivery of any Supplement shall not require the
consent of any other Grantor hereunder. The rights and obligations of each
Grantor hereunder and each other Loan Party and other party (other than a Credit
Party) under the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the addition of any Additional Grantor as a party to this
Supplemental Security Agreement.

ARTICLE 12. NOTICES

                All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and
given as provided in Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement. All communications
and notices hereunder to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be given
to it at its address for notices set forth in such Section, and all
communications and notices hereunder to any other Grantor shall be given to it
at its address for notices set forth on Schedule I hereto or to the applicable
Supplement, with, in the case of any Grantor other than the Borrower, a copy to
the Borrower.

ARTICLE 13. BINDING EFFECT; SEVERAL AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS

                Whenever in this Supplemental Security Agreement any of the
parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the
successors and assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises and agreements
by or on behalf of any Grantor that are contained in this Supplemental Security
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and its
successors and assigns. This Supplemental Security Agreement shall become
effective as to any Grantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such
Grantor shall have been delivered to the


                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>


Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf
of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Grantor
and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and
shall inure to the benefit of such Grantor, the Administrative Agent and the
other Secured Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that
no Grantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or
any interest herein or in any of the Collateral (and any such attempted
assignment shall be void), except as expressly contemplated by this Supplemental
Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents. This Supplemental Security
Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each of the
Grantors and may be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or
released with respect to any Grantor without the approval of any other Grantor
and without affecting the obligations of any other Grantor hereunder.

ARTICLE 14. SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY

                All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
by the Grantors herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Supplemental Security Agreement
or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and shall survive the
execution and delivery of any Loan Document and the making of any Loan,
regardless of any investigation made by the Secured Parties or on their behalf,
and shall continue in full force and effect until this Supplemental Security
Agreement shall terminate. In the event any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Supplemental Security Agreement or in any other Loan Document
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being
understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in
any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

ARTICLE 15. GOVERNING LAW

        THIS SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

ARTICLE 16. COUNTERPARTS

        This Supplemental Security Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute
but one contract (subject to Article 13), and shall become effective as provided
in Article 13. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Supplemental Security
Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Supplemental Security Agreement.

ARTICLE 17. HEADINGS

        Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are
for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Supplemental Security
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Supplemental Security Agreement.

ARTICLE 18. JURISDICTION; VENUE; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS

                Each Grantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City,
and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Supplemental Security Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Supplemental Security
Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Supplemental Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents against such
Grantor or any of its property in the courts of any jurisdiction. Each Grantor
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Supplemental Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents in
any foregoing court referred to in this Article. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Article 12. Nothing in this
Supplemental Security Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

ARTICLE 19. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS SUPPLEMENTAL
SECURITY AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS ARTICLE.

                       TO SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT

                               FORM OF SUPPLEMENT
                               ------------------

        SUPPLEMENT NO. __, dated as of , to the SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT,
dated as of March 8, 2002, among PENTON MEDIA, INC, a Delaware corporation (the
"BORROWER"), the subsidiaries of the Borrower party thereto, and THE BANK OF NEW
YORK, as administrative agent under the Credit Agreement referred to in the next
paragraph (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY AGREEMENT").

        Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as
of March 8, 2002, among the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto, Bank of
America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Bank One, NA (formerly known as The First
National Bank of Chicago), as Documentation Agent, Fleet National Bank, as
Co-Syndication Agent, and The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "CREDIT
AGREEMENT"). Capitalized terms (and the term "subsidiary") used herein and not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit
Agreement and the Supplemental Security Agreement.

        The Grantors have entered into the Supplemental Security Agreement in
order to induce the Credit Parties to enter into the Credit Agreement. Article
11 of the Supplemental Security Agreement provides that additional Subsidiaries
may become Grantors under the Supplemental Security Agreement by execution and
delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement. The undersigned
Subsidiary (the "NEW GRANTOR") is executing this Supplement in accordance with
the requirements of the Credit Agreement to become a Grantor under the
Supplemental Security Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make
additional Loans and as consideration for Loans previously made.

        Accordingly, the Administrative Agent and the New Grantor hereby agree
as follows:

         Section 1. In accordance with Article 11 of the Supplemental Security
Agreement, the New Grantor by its signature below becomes a Grantor under the
Supplemental Security Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally
named therein as a Grantor, and the New Grantor hereby agrees to all the terms
and provisions of the Supplemental Security Agreement applicable to it as a
Grantor thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New Grantor, as
security for the payment and performance in full of the Obligations, does hereby
create and grant to the Administrative Agent (and its successors and assigns),
for the benefit of the Secured Parties (and their successors and assigns), a
security interest in and lien on all of the New Grantor's right, title and
interest in and to the Collateral (as defined in the Supplemental Security
Agreement) owned or held by or on behalf of the New Grantor. Each reference to a
"Grantor" in the Supplemental Security Agreement shall be deemed to include the
New Grantor. The Supplemental Security Agreement is hereby incorporated herein
by reference.

         Section 2. The New Grantor represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties that (i) this Supplement has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it


<PAGE>


and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally, (ii) set forth on the Schedules attached hereto are true and complete
schedules of all of the information that would have been required to have been
delivered by or on behalf of the New Grantor pursuant to the Supplemental
Security Agreement and the Schedules thereto if the New Grantor had been
originally named in the Supplemental Security Agreement, and (iii) the
representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor under the Supplemental

                    (b) The Grantor irrevocably authorizes and directs the
Securities Intermediary, and the Securities Intermediary agrees, to comply with

with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, entitlement
orders, originated by the Grantor.

                    (d) Upon receipt by the Securities Intermediary of a Notice

<PAGE>


Grantor or any other person (other than the Agent) and shall accept all such
instructions only from the Agent.

          Section 7. MAINTENANCE OF SECURITIES ACCOUNT

                In addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to honor entitlement orders as agreed in Section 6

follows:

                    (a) PERMITTED INVESTMENTS. Until such time as the Securities

Grantor shall direct the Securities Intermediary with respect to the selection
of investments to be made for the Securities Account.

                    (b) STATEMENTS AND CONFIRMATIONS. The Securities
Intermediary will promptly send copies of all statements, confirmations and

security entitlement against the Securities Intermediary with respect to any of
the Collateral.

                    (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8 hereof, the

                To the extent that the Securities Intermediary has or may have
in the future any security interest in or lien on any of the Collateral, the
Securities Intermediary subordinates such security interest and lien to the
security interest of the secured parties represented herein by the Agent, except
that the Securities Intermediary may retain its lien on the Collateral to secure
(a) advances made by the


                                       7
<PAGE>


Securities Intermediary in connection with the advance posting of dividends,

other advances made by the Grantor as part of its cash management services, all
in the ordinary course of business, (b) advances made in connection with the
settlement of securities transactions and (c) normal commissions and fees for
the Securities Account. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
Securities Intermediary waives any lien, security interest, right of set-off or
deduction or banker's lien which it may have in or on the Collateral.

        Section 10.     LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

                    (a) The Securities Intermediary shall not be liable for any
loss or injury resulting from its actions or its performance or lack of
performance of its duties hereunder or for its investment decisions in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. In no event shall
the Securities Intermediary be liable for (i) acting in accordance with
instructions from the Grantor or, after the delivery of a Notice of Exclusive
Control, the Agent, (ii) special, consequential or punitive damages, (iii)
losses due to forces beyond the control of the Securities Intermediary or any

interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer
(software and hardware) services, or (iv) the acts of omissions of its agents or
subcustodians so long as the selection of such agents or subcustodians was not
grossly negligent or an act of willful misconduct.

                    (b) The Grantor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Securities Intermediary against any claims, liabilities, expenses or losses
in any way arising out of or related to this Securities Account Control
Agreement (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements), except to
the extent that the claims, liabilities, expenses or losses are caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securities Intermediary. The
provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Securities
Account Control Agreement.

to be the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction (within the meaning of Section
8-110 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time (including
any successor thereto) in the State of New York), and the Securities Account (as
well as the security entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard

of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together,
shall constitute but one contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this
Securities Account Control Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Securities
Account Control Agreement.

          Section 15. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

                EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
SECURITIES ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF


                                       9
<PAGE>


ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS SECURITIES ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

          Section 16. MISCELLANEOUS

                    (a) This Securities Account Control Agreement does not
create any obligation or duty of the Securities Intermediary other than those
expressly set forth herein.

                    (b) No amendment, supplement or modification of this
Securities Account Control Agreement, or any waiver of any right hereunder,
shall be binding on any party to this Securities Account Control Agreement
unless it is in writing and signed by each of the parties to this Securities
Account Control Agreement.

                    (c) Section headings have been inserted in this Securities
Account Control Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Securities
Account Control Agreement.

                    (d) In the event any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Securities Account Control Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the
validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall
endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

                    (e) The provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby.

                    (f) This Securities Account Control Agreement and the
exhibits hereto constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

Environmental Matters:

        None.

Litigation:

         1. ALIDENA V. PENTON MEDIA, INC., ET AL. Class action lawsuit filed
December 2, 1998 against the Borrower and Internet World Media, Inc. on behalf
of shareholders of Mecklermedia Corporation alleging securities law violations
in the Borrower's tender offer for shares of Mecklermedia Corporation. In
January 2000 the class certification was denied. Plaintiffs filed a petition for
interlocutory review of the denial of class certification. The District Court
entered an order certifying the class. The District Court denied the Borrower's
motion for summary judgment.

         2. JOSEPH STEPIC V. PENTON MEDIA, INC. - On August 3, 1999, a Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, common pleas jury returned a verdict against the Borrower in a
lawsuit where the plaintiff claimed sexual harassment and retaliation. The jury
awarded the plaintiff $854,500. On appeal, that verdict was reversed, judgment
was entered for the Borrower on several claims and the balance of the case was
remanded to the trial court for further processing. Subsequently, the Ohio
Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The trial court has not yet indicated
its intentions with regard to the balance of the case.
