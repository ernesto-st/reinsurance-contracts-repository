Interest  Period of one month  which  begins and ends on the same day,  and (iv)

            (c) Subject to and upon the terms and  conditions  set forth herein,

longer be  applicable),  prior to the 90th day following  the Initial  Borrowing
Date,  Revolving Loans may only be incurred and maintained as, and/or  converted

together  with all  outstanding  Term Loans that are  maintained  as  Eurodollar
Loans,  are subject to an Interest  Period of one month which begins and ends on
the same  day,  (iii)  may be  repaid  and  reborrowed  in  accordance  with the
provisions  hereof,  and (iv) shall not  exceed for any such  Lender at any time
outstanding that aggregate  principal amount which, when added to the product of
(x) such Lender's RL Percentage  and (y) the sum of (I) the aggregate  amount of
all Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid
with the proceeds of, and simultaneously  with the incurrence of, the respective
incurrence  of Revolving  Loans) at such time and (II) the  aggregate  principal
amount of all Swingline  Loans  (exclusive  of Swingline  Loans which are repaid
with the proceeds of, and simultaneously  with the incurrence of, the respective
incurrence  of Revolving  Loans) then  outstanding,  equals the  Revolving  Loan
Commitment of such Lender at such time.

            (d) Subject to and upon the terms and  conditions  set forth herein,
the  Swingline  Lender  agrees to make,  at any time and from time to time on or
after the Initial  Borrowing  Date and prior to the  Swingline  Expiry  Date,  a
revolving loan or revolving loans (each, a "Swingline  Loan" and,  collectively,
the  "SWINGLINE  LOANS") to the  Borrower,  which  Swingline  Loans (i) shall be

Dollars,  (iii) may be repaid and  reborrowed in accordance  with the provisions
hereof,  (iv)  shall  not  exceed  in  aggregate  principal  amount  at any time
outstanding,  when combined with the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving
Loans  then  outstanding  and the  aggregate  amount  of all  Letter  of  Credit
Outstandings  at  such  time,  an  amount  equal  to the  Total  Revolving  Loan
Commitment at such time, and (v) shall not exceed in aggregate  principal amount
at any time outstanding the Maximum Swingline Amount.  Notwithstanding  anything
to the contrary  contained in this Section  1.01(d),  (i) the  Swingline  Lender
shall  not be  obligated  to make any  Swingline  Loans at a time  when a Lender
Default  exists with  respect to an RL Lender  unless the  Swingline  Lender has
entered into  arrangements  satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the
Swingline  Lender's risk with respect to the  Defaulting  Lender's or Defaulting
Lenders'   participation   in   such   Swingline   Loans,   including   by  cash
collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's or Defaulting Lenders' RL Percentage of
the outstanding  Swingline  Loans,  and (ii) the Swingline Lender shall not make

                                      -2-

<PAGE>



any Swingline Loan after it has received  written notice from the Borrower,  any
other Credit Party or the Required Lenders stating that a Default or an Event of
Default exists and is continuing  until such time as the Swingline  Lender shall
have  received  written  notice (A) of  rescission  of all such notices from the
party or  parties  originally  delivering  such  notice or notices or (B) of the
waiver of such Default or Event of Default by the Required Lenders.

            (e) On any  Business  Day,  the  Swingline  Lender  may, in its sole
discretion,   give  notice  to  the  RL  Lenders  that  the  Swingline  Lender's
outstanding  Swingline  Loans  shall be funded  with one or more  Borrowings  of
Revolving  Loans  (PROVIDED  that  such  notice  shall be  deemed  to have  been
automatically  given  upon the  occurrence  of a Default  or an Event of Default
under Section 10.05 or upon the exercise of any of the remedies  provided in the
last paragraph of Section 10), in which case one or more Borrowings of Revolving
Loans   constituting  Base  Rate  Loans  (each  such  Borrowing,   a  "MANDATORY
BORROWING") shall be made on the immediately  succeeding  Business Day by all RL
Lenders pro rata based on each such RL Lender's RL Percentage (determined before
giving effect to any termination of the Revolving Loan  Commitments  pursuant to
the last  paragraph  of Section 10) and the  proceeds  thereof  shall be applied
directly  by the  Swingline  Lender  to  repay  the  Swingline  Lender  for such
outstanding  Swingline Loans. Each RL Lender hereby  irrevocably  agrees to make
Revolving  Loans upon one  Business  Day's  notice  pursuant  to each  Mandatory
Borrowing in the amount and in the manner  specified in the  preceding  sentence
and on the date specified in writing by the Swingline Lender notwithstanding (i)
the amount of the Mandatory  Borrowing may not comply with the Minimum Borrowing
Amount otherwise required  hereunder,  (ii) whether any conditions  specified in
Section 6 are then  satisfied,  (iii)  whether a Default  or an Event of Default
then exists,  (iv) the date of such Mandatory  Borrowing,  and (v) the amount of
the  Total  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  at such  time.  In the  event  that any
Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required
above  (including,  without  limitation,  as a result of the  commencement  of a
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each RL
Lender  hereby  agrees  that it  shall  forthwith  purchase  (as of the date the
Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
received  from the  Borrower  on or after such date and prior to such  purchase)
from the Swingline Lender such participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans
as shall be necessary to cause the RL Lenders to share in such  Swingline  Loans
ratably based upon their  respective RL  Percentages  (determined  before giving
effect to any termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to the last
paragraph  of  Section  10),  provided  that  (x) all  interest  payable  on the
Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline  Lender until the date
as of which the respective participation is required to be purchased and, to the
extent  attributable  to the  purchased  participation,  shall be payable to the
participant  from and  after  such  date and (y) at the  time  any  purchase  of
participations  pursuant to this sentence is actually  made,  the  purchasing RL
Lender shall be required to pay the Swingline  Lender  interest on the principal
amount of  participation  purchased for each day from and including the day upon
which the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the
date of payment for such participation,  at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for
the first three days and at the interest rate otherwise  applicable to Revolving
Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans hereunder for each day thereafter.

            1.02  MINIMUM  AMOUNT OF EACH  BORROWING.  The  aggregate  principal
amount of each  Borrowing of Loans under a respective  Tranche shall not be less
than the Minimum  Borrowing  Amount  applicable to such  Tranche.  More than one

                                      -3-

<PAGE>



Borrowing may occur on the same date,  but at no time shall there be outstanding
more than ten  Borrowings of Eurodollar  Loans in the aggregate for all Tranches
of Loans.

            1.03 NOTICE OF BORROWING. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur
(x) Eurodollar Loans hereunder,  it shall give the  Administrative  Agent at the
Notice Office at least three Business Days' prior notice of each Eurodollar Loan
to be incurred hereunder and (y) Base Rate Loans hereunder  (excluding Swingline
Loans and Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing), it shall give
the Administrative  Agent at the Notice Office at least one Business Day's prior
notice of each Base Rate Loan to be incurred  hereunder,  provided that (in each
case) any such  notice  shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only
if given before 12:00 Noon (New York time) on such day.  Each such notice (each,
a "Notice of  Borrowing"),  except as  otherwise  expressly  provided in Section
1.10,  shall be irrevocable  and shall be in writing,  or by telephone  promptly
confirmed  in writing,  in the form of Exhibit A-1,  appropriately  completed to
specify: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be incurred pursuant
to such  Borrowing,  (ii) the date of such Borrowing  (which shall be a Business
Day),  (iii) whether the Loans being incurred  pursuant to such Borrowing  shall
constitute A Term Loans,  B Term Loans or  Revolving  Loans and (iv) whether the
Loans being incurred  pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially  maintained
as Base Rate Loans or, to the extent permitted hereunder,  Eurodollar Loans and,
if Eurodollar Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable  thereto.  The
Administrative  Agent shall  promptly give each Lender which is required to make
Loans of the Tranche specified in the respective Notice of Borrowing,  notice of
such proposed Borrowing, of such Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the
other matters required by the immediately  preceding sentence to be specified in
the Notice of Borrowing.

            (b) (i)  Whenever  the  Borrower  desires to incur  Swingline  Loans
hereunder, the Borrower shall give the Swingline Lender no later than 11:00 A.M.
(New York time) on the date that a  Swingline  Loan is to be  incurred,  written
notice or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing of each Swingline Loan
to be incurred  hereunder.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and specify in
each case (A) the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), and (B) the
aggregate  principal  amount of the Swingline  Loans to be incurred  pursuant to
such Borrowing.

            (ii) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in
Section 1.01(e),  with the Borrower irrevocably  agreeing,  by its incurrence of
any Swingline  Loan,  to the making of the Mandatory  Borrowings as set forth in
Section 1.01(e).

            (c) Without in any way  limiting the  obligation  of the Borrower to
confirm in writing any  telephonic  notice of any  Borrowing  or  prepayment  of
Loans, the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, may
act without  liability upon the basis of telephonic  notice of such Borrowing or
prepayment,  as the case may be,  believed  by the  Administrative  Agent or the
Swingline  Lender,  as the case  may be,  in good  faith  to be from  the  Chief
Executive  Officer,  the Chief  Financial  Officer or the General Counsel of the
Borrower,  or from any other  authorized  officer of the Borrower  designated in
writing by the Borrower to the Administrative  Agent as being authorized to give
such notices,  prior to receipt of written confirmation.  In each such case, the
Borrower  hereby  waives  the right to  dispute  the  Administrative  Agent's or

                                      -4-

<PAGE>



Swingline  Lender's  record  of the  terms  of such  telephonic  notice  of such
Borrowing or prepayment of Loans, as the case may be, absent manifest error.

            1.04  DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS. No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time)
on the  date  specified  in each  Notice  of  Borrowing  (or (x) in the  case of
Swingline Loans, no later than 12:00 Noon. (New York time) on the date specified
pursuant to Section  1.03(b)(i) or (y) in the case of Mandatory  Borrowings,  no
later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date specified in Section  1.01(e)),
each Lender with a Commitment of the respective  Tranche will make available its
pro rata portion  (determined  in  accordance  with  Section  1.07) of each such
Borrowing  requested to be made on such date (or in the case of Swingline Loans,
the  Swingline  Lender will make  available the full amount  thereof).  All such
amounts will be made available in Dollars and in immediately  available funds at
the Payment Office,  and the  Administrative  Agent will,  except in the case of
Revolving  Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory  Borrowing,  make available to the
Borrower at the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available by
the Lenders.  Unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have been  notified by any
Lender prior to the date of  Borrowing  that such Lender does not intend to make
available to the Administrative  Agent such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to
be made on such date, the  Administrative  Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing
and the  Administrative  Agent may (but shall not be obligated  to), in reliance
upon such assumption,  make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If
such  corresponding  amount is not in fact made available to the  Administrative
Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding  amount on demand  from such  Lender.  If such Lender does not pay
such  corresponding  amount  forthwith  upon the  Administrative  Agent's demand
therefor,  the  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Borrower shall immediately pay such  corresponding  amount to the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover on demand from
such Lender or the Borrower,  as the case may be, interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such  corresponding  amount was made
available  by the  Administrative  Agent to the  Borrower  until  the date  such
corresponding  amount is recovered by the  Administrative  Agent,  at a rate per
annum equal to (i) if recovered  from such Lender,  the overnight  Federal Funds
Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate  otherwise  applicable to
such Loans for each day thereafter and (ii) if recovered from the Borrower,  the
rate of interest applicable to the respective Borrowing,  as determined pursuant
to Section  1.08.  Nothing in this  Section  1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its  obligation  to make Loans  hereunder or to prejudice any rights
which the  Borrower  may have  against  any Lender as a result of any failure by
such Lender to make Loans hereunder.

            1.05 NOTES.  (a) The Borrower's  obligation to pay the principal of,
and  interest  on,  the Loans  made by each  Lender  shall be  evidenced  in the
Register  maintained by the  Administrative  Agent pursuant to Section 13.15 and

or any error in such notation  shall not affect the  Borrower's  obligations  in
respect of such Loans.

            (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this
Section 1.05 or elsewhere  in this  Agreement,  Notes shall only be delivered to
Lenders which at any time  specifically  request the delivery of such Notes.  No
failure of any Lender to  request or obtain a Note  evidencing  its Loans to the
Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the Borrower to
pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) incurred by the Borrower which would
otherwise be  evidenced  thereby in  accordance  with the  requirements  of this
Agreement,  and shall not in any way affect the security or guaranties  therefor
provided  pursuant to the various  Credit  Documents.  Any Lender which does not
have a Note  evidencing its  outstanding  Loans shall in no event be required to
make the notations otherwise described in preceding clause (f). At any time when
any Lender  requests the  delivery of a Note to evidence  any of its Loans,  the
Borrower  shall  promptly  execute  and  deliver  to the  respective  Lender the
requested Note in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.

            1.06 CONVERSIONS.  The Borrower shall have the option to convert, on
any  Business  Day,  all or a portion  equal to at least the  Minimum  Borrowing
Amount of the outstanding  principal amount of Loans (other than Swingline Loans
which may not be converted  pursuant to this Section  1.06) made pursuant to one
or more  Borrowings  (so long as of the same  Tranche)  of one or more  Types of
Loans into a Borrowing (of the same  Tranche) of another Type of Loan,  provided
that, (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.10(b),  Eurodollar Loans may
be  converted  into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an  Interest  Period
applicable  to the Loans  being  converted  and no such  partial  conversion  of
Eurodollar  Loans  shall  reduce  the  outstanding   principal  amount  of  such
Eurodollar  Loans made  pursuant to a single  Borrowing to less than the Minimum
Borrowing Amount applicable thereto,  (ii) unless the Required Lenders otherwise
agree, Base Rate Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if no Default
or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion,  (iii) unless
the  Administrative  Agent  otherwise  agrees  in  its  sole  discretion  or has
determined  that the  Syndication  Date has  occurred (at which time this clause
(iii)  shall no  longer  be  applicable),  prior to the 90th day  following  the
Initial  Borrowing Date,  conversions of Base Rate Loans into  Eurodollar  Loans
shall be  subject  to the  provisions  of clause  (B) of the  proviso in each of
Sections  1.01(a)(iii),  1.01(b)(iii)  and  1.01(c)(ii),  and (iv) no conversion
pursuant to this Section 1.06 shall result in a greater  number of Borrowings of
Eurodollar  Loans than is permitted  under  Section 1.02.  Each such  conversion
shall be effected  by the  Borrower  by giving the  Administrative  Agent at the
Notice Office prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at least three  Business Days'

                                      -7-

<PAGE>



prior  notice  (each,  a  "Notice  of  CONVERSION/CONTINUATION")  in the form of
Exhibit A-2,  appropriately  completed to specify the Loans to be so  converted,
the Borrowing or  Borrowings  pursuant to which such Loans were incurred and, if
to be converted  into  Eurodollar  Loans,  the  Interest  Period to be initially
applicable  thereto.  The  Administrative  Agent shall give each  Lender  prompt
notice of any such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans.

            1.07 PRO RATA BORROWINGS. All Borrowings of Term Loans and Revolving
Loans under this  Agreement  shall be incurred  from the Lenders pro rata on the
basis of their A Term Loan  Commitments,  B Term Loan  Commitments  or Revolving
Loan  Commitments,  as the case may be,  provided that all Mandatory  Borrowings
shall  be  incurred  from  the RL  Lenders  pro  rata on the  basis  of their RL
Percentages.  It is  understood  that no  Lender  shall be  responsible  for any
default by any other Lender of its  obligation to make Loans  hereunder and that
each  Lender  shall be  obligated  to make the Loans  provided  to be made by it
hereunder,  regardless  of the  failure  of any  other  Lender to make its Loans
hereunder.

            1.08 INTEREST. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of
the unpaid  principal  amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date of  Borrowing
thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity  thereof  (whether by acceleration
or  otherwise)  and (ii) the  conversion  of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar
Loan pursuant to Section 1.06 or 1.09, as applicable,  at a rate per annum which
shall be equal to the sum of the Applicable  Margin plus the Base Rate,  each as
in effect from time to time.

            (b) The  Borrower  agrees to pay  interest  in respect of the unpaid
principal  amount of each  Eurodollar  Loan from the date of  Borrowing  thereof
until the  earlier of (i) the  maturity  thereof  (whether  by  acceleration  or
otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such  Eurodollar  Loan to a Base Rate Loan
pursuant to Section 1.06, 1.09 or 1.10, as applicable, at a rate per annum which
shall,  during each Interest Period applicable  thereto,  be equal to the sum of
the Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such Interest Period
plus the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

            (c) Upon the occurrence and during the  continuation  of an Event of
Default,  all principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in
respect of each Loan  shall,  in each case,  bear  interest  at a rate per annum
equal to the  greater  of (x) the rate  which is 2% in  excess  of the rate then
borne by such Loans and (y) the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate otherwise
applicable to Base Rate Loans of the  respective  Tranche from time to time, and
all other overdue amounts payable  hereunder and under any other Credit Document
shall bear  interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2% in excess
of the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained at Base Rate Loans
from time to time.  Interest  that accrues  under this Section  1.08(c) shall be
payable on demand.

            (d) Accrued (and  theretofore  unpaid) interest shall be payable (i)
in respect of each Base Rate Loan,  (x)  quarterly in arrears on each  Quarterly
Payment  Date,  (y) on the date of any  repayment or  prepayment  in full of all
outstanding  Base Rate Loans of any  Tranche,  and (z) at  maturity  (whether by
acceleration  or otherwise)  and,  after such maturity,  on demand,  and (ii) in
respect of each  Eurodollar  Loan,  (x) on the last day of each Interest  Period
applicable  thereto  and, in the case of an  Interest  Period in excess of three
months,  on each date occurring at three month  intervals after the first day of
such Interest Period, and (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment (on the

                                      -8-

<PAGE>



amount repaid or prepaid),  at maturity  (whether by  acceleration or otherwise)
and, after such maturity, on demand.

            (e) Upon each Interest  Determination Date, the Administrative Agent
shall determine the Eurodollar  Rate for each Interest Period  applicable to the
respective  Eurodollar  Loans and shall  promptly  notify the  Borrower  and the
Lenders thereof.  Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final
and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

            1.09 INTEREST PERIODS.  At the time the Borrower gives any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of  Conversion/Continuation  in respect of the making of, or
conversion into, any Eurodollar Loan (in the case of the initial Interest Period
applicable thereto) or prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the third Business
Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period  applicable to such Eurodollar
Loan (in the case of any subsequent  Interest  Period),  the Borrower shall have
the right to elect the interest period (each, an "Interest  Period")  applicable
to such  Eurodollar  Loan,  which  Interest  Period shall,  at the option of the
Borrower (but  otherwise  subject to the provisions of clause (B) of the proviso
in each of Sections 1.01(a)(iii),  1.01(b)(iii) and 1.01(c)(ii)), be a one, two,
three or six month period, provided that (in each case):

            (i) all Eurodollar  Loans  comprising a Borrowing shall at all times
      have the same Interest Period;

            (ii) the  initial  Interest  Period  for any  Eurodollar  Loan shall
      commence on the date of Borrowing of such  Eurodollar  Loan (including the
      date of any  conversion  thereto from a Base Rate Loan) and each  Interest
      Period  occurring  thereafter  in  respect of such  Eurodollar  Loan shall
      commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable
      thereto expires;

            (iii) if any Interest  Period for a Eurodollar  Loan begins on a day
      for which there is no numerically  corresponding day in the calendar month
      at the end of such Interest Period,  such Interest Period shall end on the
      last Business Day of such calendar month;

            (iv) if any Interest  Period for a Eurodollar  Loan would  otherwise
      expire on a day which is not a Business Day,  such  Interest  Period shall
      expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if any
      Interest  Period for a  Eurodollar  Loan would  otherwise  expire on a day
      which  is not a  Business  Day but is a day of the  month  after  which no
      further  Business  Day occurs in such month,  such  Interest  Period shall
      expire on the next preceding Business Day;

            (v) unless the Required Lenders  otherwise agree, no Interest Period
      may be  selected at any time when a Default or an Event of Default is then
      in existence;

            (vi) no Interest  Period in respect of any  Borrowing of any Tranche
      of Loans shall be selected which extends  beyond the  respective  Maturity
      Date for such Tranche of Loans; and

            (vii) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of A Term Loans
      shall be  selected  which  extends  beyond any date upon which a mandatory
      repayment  of such A Term Loans will be required to be made under  Section

                                      -9-

<PAGE>



      4.02(b) if the aggregate  principal amount of such A Term Loans which have
      Interest  Periods  which will expire  after such date will be in excess of
      the aggregate  principal amount of such A Term Loans then outstanding less
      the aggregate amount of such required repayment.

If by  12:00  Noon  (New  York  time) on the  third  Business  Day  prior to the
expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans,
the Borrower has failed to elect,  or is not permitted to elect,  a new Interest
Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans as provided above, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar  Loans into Base Rate
Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.

            1.10  INCREASED  COSTS,  ILLEGALITY,  ETC. (a) In the event that any
Lender shall have determined (which  determination shall, absent manifest error,
be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to
clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

            (i) on any  Interest  Determination  Date  that,  by  reason  of any
      changes  arising after the date of this Agreement  affecting the interbank
      Eurodollar  market,  adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining
      the  applicable  interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition
      of Eurodollar Rate; or

            (ii) at any time,  that such Lender shall incur  increased  costs or
      reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
      any Eurodollar  Loan because of (x) any change since the Effective Date in
      any applicable law or governmental rule,  regulation,  order, guideline or
      request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the  interpretation
      or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or
      governmental rule,  regulation,  order, guideline or request, such as, but
      not  limited  to: (A) a change in the basis of  taxation of payment to any
      Lender of the  principal  of or  interest on the Loans or the Notes or any
      other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on,
      or  determined  by  reference  to, the net  income or net  profits of such
      Lender  pursuant to the laws of the  jurisdiction in which it is organized
      or in which its principal  office or applicable  lending office is located
      or any subdivision thereof or therein) or (B) a change in official reserve
      requirements,  but,  in all  events,  excluding  reserves  required  under
      Regulation D to the extent  included in the  computation of the Eurodollar
      Rate  and/or (y) other  circumstances  arising  since the  Effective  Date
      affecting such Lender, the interbank  Eurodollar market or the position of
      such Lender in such market; or

            (iii) at any time,  that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar
      Loan  has  been  made  (x)  unlawful  by  any  law or  governmental  rule,
      regulation  or order,  (y)  impossible by compliance by any Lender in good
      faith with any  governmental  request (whether or not having force of law)
      or (z)  impracticable  as a result of a  contingency  occurring  after the
      Effective  Date which  materially  and  adversely  affects  the  interbank
      Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event,  such Lender (or the  Administrative  Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above)  shall  promptly  give notice (by  telephone  promptly
confirmed  in writing)  to the  Borrower  and,  except in the case of clause (i)

                                      -10-

<PAGE>



above,  to the  Administrative  Agent of such  determination  (which  notice the
Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  transmit  to each of the other  Lenders).
Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer
be available until such time as the  Administrative  Agent notifies the Borrower
and the  Lenders  that  the  circumstances  giving  rise to such  notice  by the
Administrative  Agent no longer exist,  and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation  given by the Borrower with respect to Eurodollar  Loans
which  have not yet been  incurred  (including  by way of  conversion)  shall be
deemed  rescinded  by the  Borrower,  (y) in the case of clause (ii) above,  the
Borrower  agrees to pay to such  Lender,  upon  such  Lender's  written  request
therefor,  such  additional  amounts (in the form of an increased  rate of, or a
different  method of  calculating,  interest or  otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion  shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender
for such  increased  costs or  reductions  in  amounts  received  or  receivable
hereunder (a written  notice as to the  additional  amounts owed to such Lender,
showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to
the  Borrower  by such  Lender  shall,  absent  manifest  error,  be  final  and
conclusive and binding on all the parties  hereto) and (z) in the case of clause
(iii)  above,  the Borrower  shall take one of the actions  specified in Section
1.10(b) as  promptly  as  possible  and,  in any event,  within the time  period
required by law.

            (b)  At any  time  that  any  Eurodollar  Loan  is  affected  by the
circumstances  described in Section  1.10(a)(ii),  the Borrower  may, and in the
case of a Eurodollar  Loan  affected by the  circumstances  described in Section
1.10(a)(iii),  the Borrower shall, either (x) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is
then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion,  cancel such Borrowing by
giving the Administrative  Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the
same  date  that  the  Borrower  was  notified  by the  affected  Lender  or the
Administrative  Agent  pursuant  to Section  1.10(a)(ii)  or (iii) or (y) if the
affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days'
written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  require the  affected  Lender to
convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan,  provided that, if more than
one Lender is affected at any time,  then all  affected  Lenders must be treated
the same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).

            (c) If any  Lender  determines  that  after the  Effective  Date the
introduction  of or any  change  in any  applicable  law or  governmental  rule,
regulation,  order,  guideline,  directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law) concerning  capital  adequacy,  or any change in interpretation or
administration thereof by the NAIC or any governmental  authority,  central bank
or comparable  agency,  will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital
required  or  expected  to be  maintained  by  such  Lender  or any  corporation
controlling  such Lender  based on the  existence of such  Lender's  Commitments
hereunder or its obligations hereunder,  then the Borrower agrees to pay to such
Lender,  upon its written demand therefor,  such additional  amounts as shall be
required to compensate  such Lender or such other  corporation for the increased
cost to such Lender or such other  corporation  or the  reduction in the rate of
return to such Lender or such other  corporation as a result of such increase of
capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably
and in good  faith and will use  averaging  and  attribution  methods  which are
reasonable,  provided that such Lender's  determination  of  compensation  owing
under this Section 1.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive
and binding on all the parties hereto.  Each Lender,  upon  determining that any
additional  amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c),  will give

                                      -11-

<PAGE>



prompt  written  notice  thereof to the  Borrower,  which  notice  shall show in
reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.

            1.11  COMPENSATION.  The Borrower  agrees to compensate each Lender,
upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis  for  requesting  such  compensation),   for  all  losses,   expenses  and
liabilities  (including,  without  limitation,  any loss,  expense or  liability
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
required  by such  Lender to fund its  Eurodollar  Loans but  excluding  loss of
anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other
than a default by such Lender or the  Administrative  Agent) a Borrowing  of, or
conversion  from or into,  Eurodollar  Loans does not occur on a date  specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation  (whether
or not  withdrawn  by the  Borrower  or deemed  withdrawn  pursuant  to  Section
1.10(a));  (ii) if any  prepayment  or repayment  (including  any  prepayment or
repayment  made  pursuant  to Section  4.01,  Section  4.02 or as a result of an
acceleration  of the Loans  pursuant to Section 10) or  conversion of any of its
Eurodollar  Loans  occurs  on a date  which is not the  last day of an  Interest
Period with respect  thereto;  (iii) if any  prepayment of any of its Eurodollar
Loans is not made on any date  specified in a notice of prepayment  given by the
Borrower;  or (iv) as a consequence  of (x) any other default by the Borrower to
repay  Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note
held by such Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b).

            1.12  CHANGE OF  LENDING  OFFICE.  Each  Lender  agrees  that on the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section  1.10(a)(ii)  or
(iii),  Section  1.10(c),  Section  2.06 or  Section  4.04 with  respect to such
Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower,  use reasonable  efforts (subject
to overall policy  considerations  of such Lender) to designate  another lending
office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event,  provided that
such  designation  is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office
suffer  no  economic,  legal or  regulatory  disadvantage,  with the  object  of
avoiding  the  consequence  of the event  giving rise to the  operation  of such
Section.  Nothing in this  Section  1.12  shall  affect or  postpone  any of the
obligations  of the  Borrower  or the right of any Lender  provided  in Sections
1.10, 2.06 and 4.04.

            1.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.  (x) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender,  (y) upon the  occurrence  of an event  giving rise to the  operation of
Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with
respect to any Lender  which  results in such Lender  charging  to the  Borrower
increased costs in excess of those being generally  charged by the other Lenders
or (z) in the case of a  refusal  by a Lender to  consent  to  certain  proposed
changes,  waivers,  discharges or  terminations  with respect to this  Agreement
which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided
in Section  13.12(b),  the Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event
of Default  then  exists (or, in the case of  preceding  clause (z),  will exist
immediately  after giving  effect to such  replacement),  to replace such Lender
(the  "REPLACED  LENDER") with one or more other Eligible  Transferees,  none of
whom  shall  constitute  a  Defaulting  Lender  at the time of such  replacement
(collectively,  the "REPLACEMENT  LENDER") and each of whom shall be required to
be reasonably  acceptable to the Administrative  Agent, provided that (i) at the
time of any replacement  pursuant to this Section 1.13, the  Replacement  Lender
shall enter into one or more  Assignment and Assumption  Agreements  pursuant to
Section 13.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 13.04(b) to

                                      -12-

<PAGE>



be paid by the  Replacement  Lender and/or the Replaced Lender (as may be agreed
to at such  time by and among  the  Borrower,  the  Replacement  Lender  and the
Replaced Lender)) pursuant to which the Replacement  Lender shall acquire all of
the  Commitments and outstanding  Loans of, and in each case  participations  in
Letters of Credit by, the Replaced  Lender and, in connection  therewith,  shall
pay to (x) the Replaced  Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of
(I) an amount  equal to the  principal  of,  and all  accrued  interest  on, all
outstanding  Loans of the  Replaced  Lender,  (II) an amount equal to all Unpaid
Drawings that have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced  Lender,
together with all then unpaid  interest with respect  thereto at such time,  and
(III) an amount equal to all accrued,  but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the
Replaced  Lender  pursuant to Section  3.01,  (y) each Issuing  Lender an amount
equal to such Replaced  Lender's RL Percentage of any Unpaid  Drawing  (which at
such  time  remains  an  Unpaid  Drawing)  to the  extent  such  amount  was not
theretofore  funded by such Replaced  Lender to such Issuing  Lender and (z) the
Swingline Lender an amount equal to such Replaced  Lender's RL Percentage of any
Mandatory Borrowing to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such
Replaced Lender to the Swingline Lender and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower
due and owing to the Replaced Lender at such time (other than those specifically
described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment  purchase price
has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced
Lender concurrently with such replacement.  Upon the execution of the respective
Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement,  the  payment of amounts  referred to in
clauses  (i) and (ii) above and,  if so  requested  by the  Replacement  Lender,
delivery to the Replacement  Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrower,  the  Replacement  Lender shall become a Lender  hereunder and the
Replaced  Lender  shall  cease to  constitute  a Lender  hereunder,  except with
respect to indemnification  provisions under this Agreement (including,  without
limitation,  Sections 1.10,  1.11,  2.06,  4.04,  12.06 and 13.01),  which shall
survive as to such Replaced Lender.

            SECTION 2. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

            2.01  LETTERS  OF  CREDIT.  (a)  Subject  to and upon the  terms and
conditions  set forth  herein,  the Borrower may request that an Issuing  Lender
issue, at any time and from time to time on and after the Initial Borrowing Date
and prior to the 60th day prior to the  Revolving  Loan Maturity  Date,  for the
account of the  Borrower  and for the benefit of (x) any holder (or any trustee,
agent or other similar  representative  for any such holders) of L/C Supportable
Obligations, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such Issuing Lender or in such other form as is reasonably acceptable to such
Issuing  Lender,  and  (y)  sellers  of  goods  to  the  Borrower  or any of its
Subsidiaries,  an irrevocable trade letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such  Issuing  Lender  or in such  other  form as has been  approved  by such
Issuing  Lender  (each  such  letter  of  credit,  a  "LETTER  OF  CREDIT"  and,
collectively,  the  "LETTERS  OF  CREDIT").  All  Letters  of  Credit  shall  be
denominated in Dollars and shall be issued on a sight basis only.

            (b) Subject to and upon the terms and  conditions  set forth herein,
each Issuing  Lender  agrees that it will,  at any time and from time to time on
and  after  the  Initial  Borrowing  Date and prior to the 60th day prior to the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date,  following its receipt of the respective Letter of
Credit Request, issue for account of the Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit
as are  permitted  to remain  outstanding  hereunder  without  giving  rise to a
Default or an Event of Default,  provided that no Issuing  Lender shall be under
any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit of the types  described above if at
the time of such issuance:

                                      -13-

<PAGE>



            (i) any order,  judgment or decree of any governmental  authority or
      arbitrator  shall  purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing
      Lender  from  issuing  such  Letter of Credit  or any  requirement  of law
      applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive  (whether or
      not  having  the  force  of law)  from  any  governmental  authority  with
      jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such
      Issuing Lender  refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit  generally
      or such Letter of Credit in  particular  or shall impose upon such Issuing
      Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or
      capital  requirement  (for  which  such  Issuing  Lender is not  otherwise
      compensated  hereunder)  not in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender
      on the date hereof,  or any  unreimbursed  loss, cost or expense which was
      not  applicable or in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender as of the
      date hereof and which such  Issuing  Lender  reasonably  and in good faith
      deems material to it; or

            (ii) such Issuing Lender shall have received from the Borrower,  any
      other Credit Party or the Required  Lenders  prior to the issuance of such
      Letter of Credit  notice of the type  described in the second  sentence of
      Section 2.03(b).

            2.02  MAXIMUM  LETTER  OF  CREDIT  OUTSTANDINGS;  FINAL  MATURITIES.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in this  Agreement,  (i) no
Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated  Amount of which,  when added to the
Letter of Credit Outstandings  (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid on
the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the  respective  Letter of Credit) at
such time would exceed either (x) $2,000,000 or (y) when added to the sum of (I)
the aggregate  principal amount of all Revolving Loans then outstanding and (II)
the aggregate  principal  amount of all  Swingline  Loans then  outstanding,  an
amount equal to the Total  Revolving Loan Commitment at such time, and (ii) each
Letter of Credit shall by its terms terminate (x) in the case of standby Letters
of Credit, on or before the earlier of (A) the date which occurs 12 months after
the date of the issuance  thereof  (although  any such standby  Letter of Credit
shall be  extendible  for  successive  periods of up to 12 months,  but, in each
case,  not beyond the tenth  Business Day prior to the  Revolving  Loan Maturity
Date, on terms acceptable to the respective Issuing Lender) and (B) ten Business
Days prior to the  Revolving  Loan Maturity  Date,  and (y) in the case of trade
Letters of Credit,  on or before  the  earlier of (A) the date which  occurs 180
days after the date of issuance  thereof and (B) 30 days prior to the  Revolving
Loan Maturity Date.

            2.03 LETTER OF CREDIT REQUESTS;  MINIMUM STATED AMOUNT. (a) Whenever
the  Borrower  desires  that a Letter of Credit be issued for its  account,  the
Borrower shall give the  Administrative  Agent and the respective Issuing Lender
at least five  Business  Days' (or such shorter  period as is acceptable to such
Issuing  Lender)  written notice thereof  (including by way of facsimile).  Each
notice  shall be in the form of  Exhibit C,  appropriately  completed  (each,  a
"Letter of Credit Request").

            (b) The making of each Letter of Credit  Request  shall be deemed to
be a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Lenders that such Letter
of  Credit  may  be  issued  in  accordance  with,  and  will  not  violate  the
requirements of, Section 2.02. Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received
notice from the Borrower,  any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders before
it issues a Letter of Credit  that one or more of the  conditions  specified  in
Section 5 or 6 are not then  satisfied,  or that the  issuance of such Letter of

                                      -14-

<PAGE>



Credit would violate  Section 2.02,  then such Issuing Lender shall,  subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit
for the account of the Borrower in accordance  with such Issuing  Lender's usual
and customary  practices.  Upon the issuance of or  modification or amendment to
any standby  Letter of Credit,  each Issuing  Lender shall  promptly  notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such issuance, modification
or amendment  and such notice shall be  accompanied  by a copy of such Letter of
Credit or the respective  modification or amendment thereto, as the case may be.
Promptly after receipt of such notice the Administrative  Agent shall notify the
Participants,  in writing, of such issuance,  modification or amendment.  On the
first  Business  Day of  each  week,  each  Issuing  Lender  shall  furnish  the
Administrative  Agent with a written  (including  via  facsimile)  report of the
daily  aggregate  outstandings of trade Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender for the  immediately  preceding  week.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the
contrary contained in this Agreement,  in the event that a Lender Default exists
with respect to an RL Lender,  no Issuing  Lender shall be required to issue any
Letter of Credit  unless  such  Issuing  Lender has  entered  into  arrangements
satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Issuing Lender's risk with
respect to the  participation  in Letters of Credit by the Defaulting  Lender or
Lenders,  including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's or Lenders'
RL Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings.

            (c) The initial  Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall not be
less than  $250,000 or such lesser  amount as is  acceptable  to the  respective
Issuing Lender.

            2.04  LETTER  OF CREDIT  PARTICIPATIONS.  (a)  Immediately  upon the
issuance by an Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall
be deemed  to have  sold and  transferred  to each RL  Lender,  and each such RL
Lender (in its capacity  under this  Section  2.04,  a  "Participant")  shall be
deemed irrevocably and  unconditionally to have purchased and received from such
Issuing  Lender,  without  recourse  or  warranty,  an  undivided  interest  and
participation, to the extent of such Participant's RL Percentage, in such Letter
of Credit,  each drawing or payment made  thereunder and the  obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or
guaranty pertaining  thereto.  Upon any change in the Revolving Loan Commitments
or RL  Percentages  of the Lenders  pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04(b),  it is
hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid
Drawings  relating  thereto,  there  shall  be an  automatic  adjustment  to the
participations  pursuant to this Section 2.04 to reflect the new RL  Percentages
of the assignor and assignee Lender, as the case may be.

            (b) In  determining  whether to pay under any  Letter of Credit,  no
Issuing  Lender shall have any  obligation  relative to the other  Lenders other
than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of
Credit  appear to have been  delivered  and that  they  appear to  substantially
comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.  Any action
taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing  Lender under or in  connection  with
any Letter of Credit  issued by it shall not create for such Issuing  Lender any
resulting  liability to the Borrower,  any other Credit Party, any Lender or any
other  Person  unless  such  action is taken or  omitted  to be taken with gross
negligence  or  willful  misconduct  on the  part of  such  Issuing  Lender  (as
determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction  in a final and  non-appealable
decision).

                                      -15-

<PAGE>



            (c) In the event that an Issuing  Lender makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower  shall not have  reimbursed  such
amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(a),  such Issuing
Lender shall  promptly  notify the  Administrative  Agent,  which shall promptly
notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and
unconditionally  pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such  Participant's RL
Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in Dollars and in same day funds. If the
Administrative  Agent so  notifies,  prior to 12:00  Noon (New York time) on any
Business  Day,  any  Participant  required  to fund a payment  under a Letter of
Credit,  such Participant shall make available to the respective  Issuing Lender
in Dollars such  Participant's  RL  Percentage  of the amount of such payment on
such Business Day in same day funds. If and to the extent such Participant shall
not have so made its RL  Percentage  of the amount of such payment  available to
the respective  Issuing Lender,  such Participant  agrees to pay to such Issuing
Lender,  forthwith on demand such amount,  together with interest  thereon,  for
each day from such  date  until  the date  such  amount is paid to such  Issuing
Lender at the  overnight  Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the
interest  rate  applicable to Revolving  Loans that are  maintained as Base Rate
Loans for each day thereafter.  The failure of any Participant to make available
to an Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit
issued by such  Issuing  Lender shall not relieve any other  Participant  of its
obligation  hereunder to make available to such Issuing Lender its RL Percentage
of any payment  under any Letter of Credit on the date  required,  as  specified
above,  but no  Participant  shall be  responsible  for the failure of any other
Participant to make available to such Issuing Lender such other Participant's RL
Percentage of any such payment.

            (d) Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a reimbursement
obligation  as to which  it has  received  any  payments  from the  Participants
pursuant  to  clause  (c)  above,  such  Issuing  Lender  shall pay to each such
Participant which has paid its RL Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in same day
funds, an amount equal to such Participant's share (based upon the proportionate
aggregate amount  originally  funded by such Participant to the aggregate amount
funded  by all  Participants)  of the  principal  amount  of such  reimbursement
obligation  and interest  thereon  accruing after the purchase of the respective
participations.

            (e) Upon the request of any  Participant,  each Issuing Lender shall
furnish to such Participant  copies of any standby Letter of Credit issued by it
and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.

            (f) The  obligations  of the  Participants  to make payments to each
Issuing  Lender with respect to Letters of Credit shall be  irrevocable  and not
subject to any qualification or exception  whatsoever  (except in the case of an
Issuing  Lender's  gross  negligence or willful  misconduct  (as determined by a
court of competent  jurisdiction  in a final and  non-appealable  decision)) and
shall be made in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement
under all circumstances,  including,  without  limitation,  any of the following
circumstances:

            (i) any lack of validity or  enforceability of this Agreement or any
      of the other Credit Documents;

            (ii) the  existence  of any claim,  setoff,  defense or other  right
      which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against
      a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of

                                      -16-

<PAGE>



      Credit (or any Person for whom any such  transferee  may be  acting),  the
      Administrative  Agent,  any Participant,  or any other Person,  whether in
      connection with this  Agreement,  any Letter of Credit,  the  transactions
      contemplated   herein  or  any  unrelated   transactions   (including  any
      underlying  transaction  between  the  Borrower or any  Subsidiary  of the
      Borrower and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

            (iii) any draft,  certificate or any other document  presented under
      any  Letter  of  Credit  proving  to be  forged,  fraudulent,  invalid  or
      insufficient  in any  respect or any  statement  therein  being  untrue or
      inaccurate in any respect;

            (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance
      or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

            (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

            2.05 AGREEMENT TO REPAY LETTER OF CREDIT DRAWINGS.  (a) The Borrower
agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender, by making payment to the Administrative
Agent in immediately  available funds at the Payment Office,  for any payment or
disbursement made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it
(each such amount, so paid until  reimbursed,  an "Unpaid  Drawing"),  not later
than one  Business  Day  following  receipt  by the  Borrower  of notice of such
payment or  disbursement  (provided  that no such notice shall be required to be
given if a  Default  or an Event of  Default  under  Section  10.05  shall  have
occurred and be  continuing,  in which case the Unpaid  Drawing shall be due and
payable immediately without presentment,  demand,  protest or notice of any kind
(all of which are hereby waived by the  Borrower)),  with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender,  to the extent not reimbursed prior
to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement,  from
and  including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such Issuing
Lender was reimbursed by the Borrower  therefor at a rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate in effect  from time to time plus the  Applicable  Margin as in effect
from time to time for  Revolving  Loans that are  maintained as Base Rate Loans;
provided,  however, to the extent such amounts are not reimbursed prior to 12:00
Noon (New York time) on the third  Business  Day  following  the  receipt by the
Borrower of notice of such payment or  disbursement  or following the occurrence
of a  Default  or an  Event of  Default  under  Section  10.05,  interest  shall
thereafter  accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed  by such  Issuing  Lender
(and until  reimbursed  by the  Borrower)  at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable  Margin for Revolving Loans
that are  maintained  as Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time plus 2%,
with such interest to be payable on demand.  Each Issuing  Lender shall give the
Borrower prompt written notice of each Drawing under any Letter of Credit issued
by it, provided that the failure to give any such notice shall in no way affect,
impair or diminish the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

            (b) The  obligations  of the  Borrower  under this  Section  2.05 to
reimburse  each  Issuing  Lender  with  respect  to  drafts,  demands  and other
presentations  for  payment  under  Letters  of  Credit  issued  by it  (each  a
"DRAWING")  (including,  in each case,  interest  thereon) shall be absolute and
unconditional  under any and all  circumstances  and irrespective of any setoff,
counterclaim  or defense to payment which the Borrower or any  Subsidiary of the

                                      -17-

<PAGE>



Borrower may have or have had against any Lender  (including  in its capacity as
an Issuing  Lender or as a  Participant),  including,  without  limitation,  any
defense  based  upon the  failure  of any  drawing  under a Letter  of Credit to
conform  to  the  terms  of the  Letter  of  Credit  or  any  nonapplication  or
misapplication  by the  beneficiary  of the proceeds of such Drawing;  provided,
however,  that the Borrower  shall not be  obligated  to  reimburse  any Issuing
Lender for any wrongful  payment  made by such Issuing  Lender under a Letter of
Credit  issued  by it as a  result  of acts or  omissions  constituting  willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

            2.06 INCREASED  COSTS.  If at any time after the Effective Date, the
introduction  of or any change in any applicable law, rule,  regulation,  order,
guideline or request or in the  interpretation or administration  thereof by the
NAIC  or  any  governmental   authority  charged  with  the   interpretation  or
administration  thereof,  or compliance by any Issuing Lender or any Participant
with any request or directive by the NAIC or by any such governmental  authority
(whether or not having the force of law),  shall  either (i)  impose,  modify or
make applicable any reserve,  deposit,  capital adequacy or similar  requirement
against letters of credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participated in by any
Participant,  or (ii) impose on any Issuing Lender or any  Participant any other
conditions relating,  directly or indirectly, to this Agreement or any Letter of
Credit;  and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase the cost to any
Issuing Lender or any Participant of issuing,  maintaining or  participating  in
any Letter of Credit,  or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
any Issuing Lender or any Participant  hereunder or reduce the rate of return on
its capital with respect to Letters of Credit (except for changes in the rate of
tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or profits of such Issuing
Lender or such Participant  pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized or in which its principal  office or applicable  lending  office is
located or any subdivision  thereof or therein),  then, upon the delivery of the
certificate  referred  to below to the  Borrower  by any  Issuing  Lender or any
Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or
such  Participant to the  Administrative  Agent),  the Borrower agrees to pay to
such Issuing Lender or such  Participant  such  additional  amount or amounts as
will compensate such Issuing Lender or such  Participant for such increased cost
or reduction in the amount  receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its
capital.  Any  Issuing  Lender or any  Participant,  upon  determining  that any
additional  amounts  will be payable  pursuant to this Section  2.06,  will give
prompt  written  notice  thereof to the  Borrower,  which notice shall include a
certificate submitted to the Borrower by such Issuing Lender or such Participant
(a copy of  which  certificate  shall  be sent  by the  Issuing  Lender  or such
Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for the  calculation  of such  additional  amount or amounts  necessary to
compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant.  The certificate required to
be delivered  pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall,  absent  manifest  error,  be
final and conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

            SECTION 3. COMMITMENT COMMISSION; FEES; REDUCTIONS OF COMMITMENT.

            3.01  FEES.  (a) The  Borrower  agrees to pay to the  Administrative
Agent for distribution to each Non-Defaulting RL Lender a commitment  commission
(the  "COMMITMENT  COMMISSION")  for the period from and including the Effective
Date to and including the Revolving  Loan Maturity Date (or such earlier date on
which the Total  Revolving Loan  Commitment has been  terminated)  computed at a
rate per annum equal to 1/2 of 1% of the Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment of
such Non-Defaulting RL Lender as in effect from time to time. Accrued Commitment

                                      -18-

<PAGE>



Commission  shall be due and  payable  quarterly  in arrears  on each  Quarterly
Payment Date and on the date upon which the Total  Revolving Loan  Commitment is
terminated.

            (b) The  Borrower  agrees  to pay to the  Administrative  Agent  for
distribution  to each RL Lender  (based on each such RL Lender's  respective  RL
Percentage)  a fee in respect of each  Letter of Credit  (the  "LETTER OF CREDIT
FEE") for the period from and  including  the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit to and including the date of  termination or expiration of such Letter of
Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin as in effect
from time to time during such period with  respect to  Revolving  Loans that are
maintained as Eurodollar Loans on the daily Stated Amount of each such Letter of
Credit.  Accrued  Letter of Credit  Fees shall be due and payable  quarterly  in
arrears  on each  Quarterly  Payment  Date and on the  first day on or after the
termination  of the Total  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  upon which no Letters of
Credit remain outstanding.

            (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing  Lender,  for its own
account,  a facing  fee in respect  of each  Letter of Credit  issued by it (the
"FACING  FEE") for the period  from and  including  the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit to and including the date of  termination or expiration of such
Letter of Credit,  computed  at a rate per annum equal to 1/4 of 1% on the daily
Stated  Amount of such Letter of Credit,  provided that in any event the minimum
amount of Facing  Fees  payable in any  twelve-month  period for each  Letter of
Credit  shall be not less  than  $1,000;  it being  agreed  that,  on the day of
issuance of any Letter of Credit and on each  anniversary  thereof  prior to the
termination  or expiration  of such Letter of Credit,  if $1,000 will exceed the
amount of Facing Fees that will accrue with respect to such Letter of Credit for
the immediately succeeding twelve-month period, the full $1,000 shall be payable
on the date of issuance  of such  Letter of Credit and on each such  anniversary
thereof.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in the  proviso  to  the  immediately
preceding  sentence,  accrued Facing Fees shall be due and payable  quarterly in
arrears on each  Quarterly  Payment  Date and upon the first day on or after the
termination  of the Total  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  upon which no Letters of
Credit remain outstanding.

            (d) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing  Lender,  for its own
account,  upon each payment  under,  issuance of, or amendment to, any Letter of
Credit  issued  by it,  such  amount  as shall at the time of such  event be the
administrative  charge and the reasonable  expenses which such Issuing Lender is
generally imposing in connection with such occurrence with respect to letters of
credit.

            (e) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such fees
as may be agreed to in writing  from time to time by the  Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and the Administrative Agent.

            3.02 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF UNUTILIZED REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS.
(a) Upon at least one Business Day's prior written notice to the  Administrative
Agent at the Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit to each of the Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, at any time
or from  time to time,  without  premium  or  penalty  to  terminate  the  Total
Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment in whole, or reduce it in part, pursuant to
this  Section  3.02(a),  in an integral  multiple of  $1,000,000  in the case of

                                      -19-

<PAGE>



partial reductions to the Total Unutilized  Revolving Loan Commitment,  provided
that each such reduction shall apply  proportionately  to permanently reduce the
Revolving Loan Commitment of each RL Lender.

            (b) In the event of a  refusal  by a Lender to  consent  to  certain
proposed  changes,  waivers,  discharges  or  terminations  with respect to this
Agreement  which  have been  approved  by the  Required  Lenders  as (and to the
extent)  provided  in  Section  13.12(b),  the  Borrower  may,  subject  to  its
compliance with the requirements of Section  13.12(b),  upon five Business Days'
prior  written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative  Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders)
terminate all of the Commitments of such Lender, so long as all Loans,  together
with  accrued and unpaid  interest,  Fees and all other  amounts,  owing to such
Lender  are  repaid  concurrently  with the  effectiveness  of such  termination
pursuant to Section  4.01(b) (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed  modified
to  reflect  such  changed  amounts)  and such  Lender's  RL  Percentage  of all
outstanding Letters of Credit is cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to
the Administrative  Agent and the respective Issuing Lenders,  and at such time,
such  Lender  shall  no  longer  constitute  a  "Lender"  for  purposes  of this
Agreement,   except  with  respect  to  indemnifications  under  this  Agreement
(including,  without  limitation,  Sections 1.10,  1.11,  2.06,  4.04, 12.06 and
13.01), which shall survive as to such repaid Lender.

            3.03 MANDATORY  REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.  (a) The Total  Commitment
(and the Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its entirety on September
30,  2003,  unless the Initial  Borrowing  Date has occurred on or prior to such
date.

            (b)  In  addition  to  any  other  mandatory  commitment  reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total A Term Loan  Commitment (and the A Term
Loan  Commitment of each Lender) shall  terminate in its entirety on the Initial
Borrowing  Date (after giving  effect to the  incurrence of A Term Loans on such
date).

            (c)  In  addition  to  any  other  mandatory  commitment  reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total B Term Loan  Commitment (and the B Term
Loan  Commitment of each Lender) shall  terminate in its entirety on the Initial
Borrowing  Date (after giving  effect to the  incurrence of B Term Loans on such
date).

            (d)  In  addition  to  any  other  mandatory  commitment  reductions
pursuant  to this  Section  3.03,  the Total  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  shall
terminate in its entirety  upon the earlier of (i) the  Revolving  Loan Maturity
Date and (ii) unless the Required Lenders  otherwise agree in writing,  the date
on which a Change of Control occurs.

            (e)  In  addition  to  any  other  mandatory  commitment  reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03,  the Total  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  shall be
reduced from time to time to the extent required by Section 4.02.

            (f) Each reduction to, or termination  of, the Total  Revolving Loan
Commitment shall be applied to proportionately reduce or terminate,  as the case
may be, the  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  of each Lender  with a Revolving  Loan
Commitment.

            SECTION 4. PREPAYMENTS; PAYMENTS; TAXES.

            4.01 VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. (a) The Borrower shall have the right to
prepay the Loans,  without  premium or penalty,  in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time on the following  terms and  conditions:  (i) the Borrower
shall give the  Administrative  Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at the
Notice  Office  (x) at  least  one  Business  Day's  prior  written  notice  (or
telephonic  notice  promptly  confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay Base
Rate Loans (or same day notice in the case of a prepayment  of Swingline  Loans)
and (y) at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly  confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay Eurodollar Loans,  which
notice  (in each case)  shall  specify,  subject  to clause (v) of this  Section
4.01(a),  whether A Term Loans, B Term Loans, Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans
shall be  prepaid,  the amount of such  prepayment  and the Types of Loans to be
prepaid  and,  in the  case of  Eurodollar  Loans,  the  specific  Borrowing  or
Borrowings  pursuant to which such Eurodollar  Loans were made, and which notice
the Administrative  Agent shall, except in the case of a prepayment of Swingline
Loans,  promptly  transmit  to  each  of the  Lenders;  (ii)  (x)  each  partial
prepayment  of Term  Loans  pursuant  to this  Section  4.01(a)  shall  be in an
aggregate  principal  amount of at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is
acceptable  to  the  Administrative  Agent),  (y)  each  partial  prepayment  of
Revolving  Loans  pursuant  to this  Section  4.01(a)  shall be in an  aggregate
principal amount of at least $500,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable to
the  Administrative  Agent in any given case) and (z) each partial prepayment of
Swingline  Loans  pursuant  to this  Section  4.01(a)  shall be in an  aggregate
principal amount of at least $100,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable to
the  Administrative  Agent in any  given  case),  provided  that if any  partial
prepayment of Eurodollar  Loans made pursuant to any Borrowing  shall reduce the
outstanding principal amount of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing
to an amount less than the Minimum  Borrowing Amount  applicable  thereto,  then
such Borrowing may not be continued as a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (and same
shall  automatically  be converted  into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) and any
election of an Interest  Period with respect thereto given by the Borrower shall
have no force or effect;  (iii) each prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.01(a)
in respect of any Loans made  pursuant to a Borrowing  shall be applied pro rata
among such Loans,  provided that at the Borrower's  election in connection  with
any  prepayment  of  Revolving  Loans  pursuant to this  Section  4.01(a),  such
prepayment shall not, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists,  be
applied to any Revolving Loan of a Defaulting  Lender;  (iv) each  prepayment of
principal  of A Term  Loans  shall be  applied  to  reduce  the  then  remaining
Scheduled  A  Repayments  on a pro rata  basis  (based  upon the then  remaining
principal amounts of the Scheduled A Repayments after giving effect to all prior
reductions  thereto);  and (v) no voluntary  prepayments  of B Term Loans may be
made  pursuant  to this  Section  4.01(a)  until  the  date on which  the  Total
Commitment  and all Letters of Credit have been  terminated and all Loans (other
than the Tranche B Term  Loans),  Notes (other than the B Term Notes) and Unpaid
Drawings,  together  with all  interest  owing with respect  thereto,  have been
indefeasably paid in full in cash.

            (b) In the event of a  refusal  by a Lender to  consent  to  certain
proposed  changes,  waivers,  discharges  or  terminations  with respect to this
Agreement  which  have been  approved  by the  Required  Lenders  as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, upon five Business Days'
prior  written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative  Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders)
repay all Loans,  together  with accrued and unpaid  interest,  Fees,  and other

                                      -21-

amounts owing to such Lender in accordance with, and subject to the requirements
of,  said  Section  13.12(b) so long as (I) all  Commitments  of such Lender are
terminated  concurrently  with such  repayment  pursuant to Section  3.02(b) (at
which  time  Schedule  I  shall  be  deemed  modified  to  reflect  the  changed
Commitments),  (II) such Lender's RL Percentage  of all  outstanding  Letters of
Credit is cash  collateralized  in a manner  satisfactory to the  Administrative
Agent  and the  respective  Issuing  Lenders  and (III)  the  consents,  if any,
required  under Section  13.12(b) in connection  with the repayment  pursuant to
this clause (b) have been obtained. Each prepayment of any A Term Loans pursuant
to this Section 4.01(b) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining  Scheduled
A Repayments of A Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then  remaining
unpaid  principal  amounts of Scheduled A Repayments  after giving effect to all
prior reductions thereto).

            4.02  MANDATORY  REPAYMENTS.  (a) On any day on which the sum of (I)
the aggregate  outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans (after giving
effect  to all  other  repayments  thereof  on such  date),  (II) the  aggregate
outstanding  principal amount of all Swingline Loans (after giving effect to all
other  repayments  thereof on such date) and (III) the  aggregate  amount of all
Letter of Credit  Outstandings,  exceeds the Total  Revolving Loan Commitment at
such time,  the  Borrower  shall  prepay on such day the  principal of Swingline
Loans and, after all Swingline Loans have been repaid in full or if no Swingline
Loans are  outstanding,  Revolving Loans in an amount equal to such excess.  If,
after giving effect to the  prepayment of all  outstanding  Swingline  Loans and
Revolving  Loans,  the  aggregate  amount of the  Letter of Credit  Outstandings
exceeds the Total Revolving Loan Commitment at such time, the Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative  Agent at the Payment Office on such day an amount of cash
and/or  Cash  Equivalents  equal to the  amount of such  excess (up to a maximum
amount  equal to the  Letter of Credit  Outstandings  at such  time),  such cash
and/or  Cash  Equivalents  to be held as  security  for all  obligations  of the
Borrower to the Issuing  Lenders and the Lenders  hereunder in a cash collateral
account to be established by the Administrative Agent.

            (b) In addition to any other mandatory  repayments  pursuant to this
Section  4.02,  on each date set forth below  (each,  a  "Scheduled  A Repayment
Date"),  the Borrower shall be required to repay that principal amount of A Term
Loans, to the extent then  outstanding,  as is set forth opposite each such date
below  (each such  repayment,  as the same may be reduced as provided in Section
4.01(a), 4.01(b) or 4.02(h), a "Scheduled A Repayment"):

exercise of employee or management stock options received during any fiscal year
of the Borrower,  to the extent (and only to the extent) the Net Equity Proceeds
therefrom do not exceed  $500,000 in the  aggregate  during such fiscal year and
(ii) any capital  contribution  made to any  Subsidiary  of the  Borrower to the

be applied on such date as a mandatory repayment and/or commitment  reduction in

            (e) In  addition to any other  mandatory  repayments  or  commitment

            (g) In  addition to any other  mandatory  repayments  or  commitment
reductions  pursuant to this Section 4.02, within 10 days following each date on

Recovery  Events  where  the Net  Insurance  Proceeds  therefrom  do not  exceed
$50,000),  an  amount  equal to 100% of the Net  Insurance  Proceeds  from  such
Recovery  Event  shall be  applied  within  such ten day  period as a  mandatory
repayment  and/or  commitment  reduction in accordance with the  requirements of
Sections 4.02(h) and (i); provided,  however,  that (x) so long as no Default or
Event of Default  then  exists  and such Net  Insurance  Proceeds  do not exceed
$500,000,  such Net  Insurance  Proceeds  shall not be required to be so applied
within  such ten day period to the extent  that the  Borrower  has  delivered  a
certificate to the Administrative  Agent within such ten day period stating that
such Net Insurance  Proceeds  shall be used to replace or restore any properties
or assets in respect of which such Net  Insurance  Proceeds  were paid within 90
days  (or  180  days in the  case  of the  replacement  or  restoration  of Real
Property)  following  the date of the  receipt  of such Net  Insurance  Proceeds
(which  certificate shall set forth the estimates of the Net Insurance  Proceeds
to be so  expended),  and (y) so long as no  Default  or Event of  Default  then
exists and if (i) the amount of such Net Insurance  Proceeds  exceeds  $500,000,
(ii) the  amount  of such Net  Insurance  Proceeds,  together  with  other  cash
available  to  the  Borrower  and  permitted  to  be  spent  by  it  on  Capital
Expenditures  during the relevant  period  pursuant to Section  9.07,  equals at
least 100% of the cost of replacement or restoration of the properties or assets
in respect of which such Net  Insurance  Proceeds were paid as determined by the
Borrower  and as  supported  by such  estimates  or  bids  from  contractors  or
subcontractors or such other supporting  information as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably  request,  (iii) the Borrower has delivered to the Administrative
Agent a certificate on or prior to the date the  application  would otherwise be
required  pursuant to this Section  4.02(g) in the form  described in clause (x)
above and also certifying the Borrower's  determination as required by preceding
clause (ii) and certifying the sufficiency of business interruption insurance as
required by succeeding  clause (iv),  and (iv) the Borrower has delivered to the
Administrative  Agent such evidence as the  Administrative  Agent may reasonably
request in form and  substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Administrative
Agent  establishing  that the  Borrower  has  sufficient  business  interruption
insurance and that the Borrower will receive payments thereunder in such amounts
and at such times as are  necessary to satisfy all  obligations  and expenses of
the Borrower  (including,  without  limitation,  all debt service  requirements,
including pursuant to this Agreement and the Senior Subordinated Notes), without
any delay or extension  thereof,  for the period from the date of the respective
casualty,  condemnation  or other event  giving rise to the  Recovery  Event and
continuing   through  the  completion  of  the  replacement  or  restoration  of
respective  properties  or assets,  then the entire  amount of the Net Insurance
Proceeds of such  Recovery  Event and not just the portion in excess of $500,000
shall be deposited with the  Administrative  Agent pursuant to a cash collateral
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent whereby such Net
Insurance  Proceeds  shall be  disbursed  to the  Borrower  from time to time as
needed to pay actual costs incurred by it in connection  with the replacement or
restoration   of  the  respective   properties  or  assets   (pursuant  to  such
certification  requirements as may be established by the Administrative  Agent),
it being  understood  and agreed  that at any time while an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing,  the Required Lenders may direct the  Administrative
Agent (in which case the Administrative Agent shall, and is hereby authorized by
the Borrower to,  follow said  directions)  to apply any or all proceeds then on
deposit in such cash  collateral  account to the  repayment  of  Obligations  in
accordance  with  the  requirements  of the  Security  Agreement,  and  provided
further,  that if all or any portion of such Net Insurance Proceeds not required
to be so applied pursuant to the preceding  proviso (whether  pursuant to clause
(x) or (y)  thereof)  are not so used within 90 days (or 180 days in the case of

Real Property) after the date of the receipt of such Net Insurance  Proceeds (or
such earlier date, if any, as the Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary determines
not to reinvest the Net Insurance  Proceeds  relating to such Recovery  Event as
set forth  above),  such  remaining  portion shall be applied on the last day of
such period (or such earlier date, as the case may be) as provided above in this
Section 4.02(g) without regard to the preceding proviso.

            (h) Each amount required to be applied pursuant to Sections 4.02(c),
(d), (e), (f) and (g) in accordance  with this Section  4.02(h) shall be applied
(i) first,  to repay the  outstanding  principal  amount of A Term  Loans,  (ii)
second,  to the extent in excess of the amounts  required to be applied pursuant
to the preceding  clause (i), to reduce the Total  Revolving Loan  Commitment in
the manner provided in Section 3.03(f) (it being  understood and agreed that (x)
the amount of any reduction to the Total  Revolving Loan  Commitment as provided
in  immediately  preceding  clause (ii) shall be deemed to be an  application of
proceeds for  purposes of this Section  4.02(h) even though cash is not actually
applied  and (y) any cash  received by the  Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries
will be retained by such Person except to the extent that such cash is otherwise
required  to be  applied  as  provided  in  Section  4.02(a)  as a result of any
reduction to the Total Revolving Loan Commitment or is otherwise  required to be
applied to the  repayment of B Term Loans as provided in clause (iii) below) and
(iii)  third,  to the  extent in excess of the  amounts  required  to be applied
pursuant  to the  preceding  clauses  (i) and (ii)  (and  only  after  the Total
Commitment  and all Letters of Credit have been  terminated and all Loans (other
than B Term  Loans),  Notes  (other than B Term Notes)  Unpaid  Drawings and all
other Senior Loan Obligations have been  indefeasably  paid in full in cash), to
the B Term Loans then  outstanding.  All  repayments of outstanding A Term Loans
pursuant to Sections  4.02(c),  (d),  (e), (f) or (g) shall be applied to reduce
the then  remaining  Scheduled A Repayments  on a pro rata basis (based upon the
then  remaining  Scheduled  A  Repayments  after  giving  effect  to  all  prior
reductions thereto).

            (i) With respect to each repayment of Loans required by this Section
4.02, the Borrower may (subject to the priority payment  requirements of Section
4.02(h))  designate the Types of Loans of the respective Tranche which are to be
repaid  and,  in the  case  of  Eurodollar  Loans,  the  specific  Borrowing  or
Borrowings of the respective  Tranche  pursuant to which such  Eurodollar  Loans
were made,  provided that:  (i) repayments of Eurodollar  Loans pursuant to this
Section 4.02 may only be made on the last day of an Interest  Period  applicable
thereto  unless all  Eurodollar  Loans of the  respective  Tranche with Interest
Periods ending on such date of required repayment and all Base Rate Loans of the
respective  Tranche have been paid in full;  (ii) if any repayment of Eurodollar
Loans  made  pursuant  to  a  single  Borrowing  shall  reduce  the  outstanding
Eurodollar  Loans made  pursuant  to such  Borrowing  to an amount less than the
Minimum   Borrowing  Amount   applicable   thereto,   such  Borrowing  shall  be
automatically  converted  into a Borrowing  of Base Rate  Loans;  and (iii) each
repayment  of any Loans made  pursuant to a Borrowing  shall be applied pro rata
among such Loans.  In the absence of a designation  by the Borrower as described
in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above,
make such designation in its sole discretion.

            (j) In addition to any other mandatory  repayments  pursuant to this
Section 4.02, (i) all then  outstanding  Loans of any Tranche shall be repaid in
full on the  respective  Maturity Date for such Tranche of Loans and (ii) unless

                                      -25-

the Required  Lenders  otherwise agree in writing,  all then  outstanding  Loans
shall be repaid in full on the date on which a Change of Control occurs.

            4.03 METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.  Except as otherwise  specifically
provided  herein,  all payments under this Agreement and under any Note shall be
made to the  Administrative  Agent for the  account  of the  Lender  or  Lenders
entitled  thereto not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date when due
and shall be made in  Dollars  in  immediately  available  funds at the  Payment
Office.  Whenever  any payment to be made  hereunder  or under any Note shall be
stated  to be due on a day which is not a  Business  Day,  the due date  thereof
shall be extended  to the next  succeeding  Business  Day and,  with  respect to
payments of principal,  interest shall be payable at the applicable  rate during
such extension.

            4.04 NET PAYMENTS.  (a) All payments made by the Borrower  hereunder
and under any Note will be made without  setoff,  counterclaim or other defense.
Except as provided in Section  4.04(b),  all such payments will be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes,
levies,  imposts,  duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature
now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political  subdivision or
taxing  authority  thereof  or  therein  with  respect  to  such  payments  (but
excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed
on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws
of the  jurisdiction  in which it is organized or the  jurisdiction in which the
principal  office or applicable  lending office of such Lender is located or any
subdivision  thereof  or  therein)  and  all  interest,   penalties  or  similar
liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes,  levies,  imposts,  duties,
fees,  assessments  or other  charges  (all  such  non-excluded  taxes,  levies,
imposts,   duties,  fees,   assessments  or  other  charges  being  referred  to
collectively  as "Taxes").  If any Taxes are so levied or imposed,  the Borrower
agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional  amounts as may
be  necessary so that every  payment of all amounts due under this  Agreement or
under any Note,  after  withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes,
will not be less than the amount  provided  for  herein or in such Note.  If any
amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence,  the
Borrower  agrees to  reimburse  each  Lender,  upon the written  request of such
Lender,  for taxes  imposed on or  measured  by the net income or net profits of
such  Lender  pursuant to the laws of the  jurisdiction  in which such Lender is
organized or in which the principal office or applicable  lending office of such
Lender is  located  or under  the laws of any  political  subdivision  or taxing
authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which
the principal office or applicable  lending office of such Lender is located and
for any  withholding of taxes as such Lender shall  determine are payable by, or
withheld from,  such Lender,  in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf
of such Lender pursuant to the preceding  sentence and in respect of any amounts
paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will
furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of
any Taxes is due pursuant to  applicable  law  certified  copies of tax receipts
evidencing  such payment by such Borrower.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Lender,  and reimburse such Lender upon its written  request,
for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

            (b) Each Lender that is not a United  States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
agrees to deliver to the  Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent on or prior to
the Effective Date or, in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee

                                      -26-

of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04(b) (unless
the respective  Lender was already a Lender hereunder  immediately prior to such
assignment  or  transfer),  on the date of such  assignment  or transfer to such
Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete  exemption  under
an  income  tax  treaty)  (or  successor  forms)  certifying  to  such  Lender's
entitlement  as  of  such  date  to a  complete  exemption  from  United  States
withholding  tax with  respect to payments to be made under this  Agreement  and
under any Note,  or (ii) if the  Lender is not a "bank"  within  the  meaning of
Section  881(c)(3)(A)  of the Code and cannot  deliver either  Internal  Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete  exemption  under
an income tax treaty) (or any successor forms) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x)
a certificate  substantially in the form of Exhibit D (any such  certificate,  a
"Section  4.04(b)(ii)  Certificate")  and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed  copies of Internal  Revenue  Service  Form W-8BEN  (with  respect to the
portfolio  interest  exemption) (or successor form)  certifying to such Lender's
entitlement  as  of  such  date  to a  complete  exemption  from  United  States
withholding  tax with  respect to  payments  of  interest  to be made under this
Agreement and under any Note. In addition,  each Lender agrees that from time to
time after the Effective Date,  when a lapse in time or change in  circumstances
renders the  previous  certification  obsolete  or  inaccurate  in any  material
respect,  such Lender will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent
two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form  W-8ECI,  Form  W-8BEN  (with  respect  to the  benefits  of any income tax
treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a
Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may
be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued  exemption  from or reduction in United  States  withholding  tax with
respect to payments  under this  Agreement  and any Note,  or such Lender  shall
immediately notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to
deliver any such Form or  Certificate,  in which case such  Lender  shall not be
required  to  deliver  any such Form or  Certificate  pursuant  to this  Section
4.04(b).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.04(a),
but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the
Borrower  shall be  entitled,  to the extent it is  required to do so by law, to
deduct or withhold  income or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any

giving effect to the  Transaction,  all of which shall survive the execution and
delivery  of this  Agreement  and the Notes and the  making of the Loans and the
issuance of the Letters of Credit,  with the  occurrence of each Credit Event on
or after the Initial  Borrowing Date being deemed to constitute a representation
and warranty  that the matters  specified in this Section 7 are true and correct
in all material respects on and as of the Initial Borrowing Date and on the date
of each such  other  Credit  Event  (it being  understood  and  agreed  that any
representation  or warranty  which by its terms is made as of a  specified  date
shall be  required to be true and correct in all  material  respects  only as of
such specified date).

            7.01  ORGANIZATIONAL  STATUS.  Each of the  Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries  (i)  is  a  duly  organized  and  validly  existing   corporation,
partnership or limited liability  company,  as the case may be, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization,  (ii) has the corporate,
partnership or limited  liability  company power and authority,  as the case may
be, to own its  property  and assets and to transact the business in which it is
engaged  and  presently  proposes to engage and (iii) is duly  qualified  and is
authorized to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
ownership,  leasing or  operation of its property or the conduct of its business
requires  such  qualifications  except for  failures to be so  qualified  which,
either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

            7.02 POWER AND  AUTHORITY.  Each  Credit  Party and each  Subsidiary
thereof has the corporate,  partnership or limited  liability  company power and
authority,  as the case may be, to  execute,  deliver  and perform the terms and

necessary  corporate,  partnership or limited  liability  company action, as the
case may be, to authorize the execution,  delivery and performance by it of each
of such  Documents.  Each  Credit  Party and each  Subsidiary  thereof  has duly
executed and delivered  each of the Documents to which it is party,  and each of
such Documents  constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation  enforceable
in  accordance  with its  terms,  except to the extent  that the  enforceability
thereof may be limited by  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws generally  affecting  creditors'  rights and by
equitable  principles  (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or
at law).

            7.03 NO VIOLATION. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by
any Credit  Party or any  Subsidiary  thereof of the  Documents to which it is a

contravene any provision of any law,  statute,  rule or regulation or any order,
writ,  injunction or decree of any court or governmental  instrumentality,  (ii)
will  conflict  with or result in any  breach  of any of the  terms,  covenants,

any provision of the  certificate or articles of  incorporation,  certificate of
formation,  limited  liability  company  agreement  or  by-laws  (or  equivalent
organizational  documents),  as  applicable,  of any Credit  Party or any of its
Subsidiaries.

            7.04 APPROVALS. No order, consent, approval, license,  authorization
or  validation  of, or filing,  recording or  registration  with (except for (x)
those  that have  otherwise  been  obtained  or made on or prior to the  Initial
Borrowing  Date and  which  remain  in full  force  and  effect  on the  Initial
Borrowing  Date and (y) filings  which are  necessary  to perfect  the  security
interests  created  under the  Security  Documents,  which  filings will be made
within five days  following the Initial  Borrowing  Date),  or exemption by, any
governmental  or  public  body or  authority,  or any  subdivision  thereof,  is
required  to be  obtained  or made by,  or on behalf  of,  any  Credit  Party to
authorize, or is required to be obtained or made by, or on behalf of, any Credit
Party in connection  with,  (i) the execution,  delivery and  performance of any
Document or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
such Document.

            7.05  FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS;   FINANCIAL   CONDITION;   UNDISCLOSED
LIABILITIES;  PROJECTIONS.  (a)  (i)  The  consolidated  balance  sheets  of the
Borrower for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000,  June 30, 2001,  June
30, 2002 and June 30, 2003, respectively,  and the related statements of income,
cash flows and retained earnings of the Borrower for each such fiscal year ended
on such dates,  copies of which have been  furnished to the Lenders prior to the
Initial Borrowing Date, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial  position of the Borrower at the dates of such balance  sheets and the
consolidated  results of the operations of the Borrower for the periods  covered
thereby.  All of the foregoing historical financial statements have been audited
by Margolin,  Winer &amp; Evens LLP (or, in the case of the aforementioned financial
statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003,  have been audited as of the
Initial  Borrowing  Date and  prepared in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles consistently applied by the Borrower.

            (ii) The pro forma consolidated  balance sheet of the Borrower as of
the Initial  Borrowing  Date (after  giving  effect to the  Transaction  and the
financing therefor),  a copy of which has been furnished to the Lenders prior to
the Initial  Borrowing Date,  presents  fairly in all material  respects the pro
forma  consolidated  financial  position  of  the  Borrower  as of  the  Initial
Borrowing Date.

            (b) On and as of the Initial  Borrowing Date and after giving effect
to the Transaction and to all  Indebtedness  (including the Loans and the Senior
Subordinated  Notes) being  incurred or assumed and Liens  created by the Credit

                                      -36-

<PAGE>



Parties in connection  therewith (i) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation,
of the Borrower on a stand-alone  basis and of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole will exceed their respective  debts,  (ii) each of the Borrower
on a stand-alone  basis and the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole
have not incurred and do not intend to incur,  and do not believe that they will
incur,  debts  beyond their  respective  ability to pay such debts as such debts
mature,  and (iii) the Borrower on a stand-alone  basis and the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole will have sufficient capital with which to conduct
their respective businesses.  For purposes of this Section 7.05(b), "debt" means
any liability on a claim, and "claim" means (a) right to payment, whether or not
such  a  right  is  reduced  to  judgment,  liquidated,   unliquidated,   fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured,
or unsecured or (b) right to an equitable  remedy for breach of  performance  if
such breach  gives rise to a payment,  whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,  matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed,  secured or unsecured.  The amount of contingent  liabilities at any
time shall be  computed  as the amount  that,  in the light of all the facts and
circumstances  existing at such time,  represents the amount that can reasonably
be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

            (c) Except as fully disclosed in the financial  statements delivered
pursuant to Section 7.05(a) and except for the Senior  Subordinated Notes, there
were as of the Initial Borrowing Date no liabilities or obligations with respect
to the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  of any nature  whatsoever  (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) which, either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to
the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries.  As of the Initial Borrowing Date, the
Borrower  knows  of no  basis  for  the  assertion  against  it or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever that is not
fully  disclosed  in the  financial  statements  delivered  pursuant  to Section
7.05(a) or referred  to in the  immediately  preceding  sentence  which,  either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (d) The Projections  delivered to the  Administrative  Agent and the
Lenders prior to the Initial Borrowing Date have been prepared in good faith and
are based on reasonable assumptions,  and there are no statements or conclusions
in the  Projections  which are based  upon or include  information  known to the
Borrower to be  misleading  in any  material  respect or which fail to take into
account  material  information  known  to the  Borrower  regarding  the  matters
reported therein.  On the Initial Borrowing Date, the Borrower believes that the
Projections are reasonable and attainable,  it being  recognized by the Lenders,
however,  that projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and
that the actual results during the period or periods  covered by the Projections
may differ from the projected results and such differences may be material.

            (e) After  giving  effect to the  Transaction  (but for this purpose
assuming that the  Transaction  and the related  financing had occurred prior to
June 30, 2002),  since June 30, 2002,  there has been no change in the condition
(financial or otherwise), business, operations, assets, liabilities or prospects
of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries  that has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have,  either  individually or in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse
Effect.

                                      -37-

            (f)  The  Borrower  has  net  operating  losses  in  the  amount  of
$93,968,023 which may be applied to the fiscal years of the Borrower ending June
30, 2004 through June 30, 2022 and which will expire between the fiscal years of
the Borrower ending June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2022.

            (g) The Borrower has filed in a timely manner all documents that the
Borrower was required to file with the SEC under Sections 13, 14(a) and 15(d) of
the  Securities  Exchange Act, since its initial  public  offering.  As of their
respective  filing dates, all documents filed by the Borrower with the SEC ("SEC
DOCUMENTS")  complied in all  material  respects  with the  requirements  of the
Securities  Exchange Act or the Securities  Act, as applicable.  None of the SEC
Documents  as of their  respective  dates  contained  any untrue  statement of a
material fact or omitted to state material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the  statements  made therein,  in light of the  circumstances
under which they were made,  not  misleading.  The  financial  statements of the
Borrower  included  in the SEC  Documents  comply  as to  form  in all  material
respects with applicable  accounting  requirements  and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

            7.06 LITIGATION.  There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
or,  to the  knowledge  of the  Borrower,  threatened  (i) with  respect  to the
Transaction  or any Document or (ii) that could  reasonably be expected,  either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            7.07 TRUE AND COMPLETE DISCLOSURE. All factual information (taken as
a  whole)  furnished  by  or on  behalf  of  the  Borrower  in  writing  to  the
Administrative  Agent  or  any  Lender  (including,   without  limitation,   all
information  contained in the Documents)  for purposes of or in connection  with
this  Agreement,  the other  Credit  Documents or any  transaction  contemplated
herein or therein is, and all other such factual  information (taken as a whole)
hereafter  furnished  by  or on  behalf  of  the  Borrower  in  writing  to  the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender will be, true and  accurate in all  material
respects on the date as of which such  information is dated or certified and not
incomplete  by omitting  to state any fact  necessary  to make such  information
(taken as a whole) not misleading in any material  respect at such time in light
of the circumstances under which such information was provided.

            7.08 USE OF PROCEEDS;  MARGIN  REGULATIONS.  (a) All proceeds of the
Term Loans will be used by the Borrower to finance, in part, the Refinancing and
to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Transaction.

            (b) All proceeds of the Revolving Loans and the Swingline Loans will
be used for the working capital and general  corporate  purposes of the Borrower
and its  Subsidiaries;  provided  that up to,  but no more than,  $3,000,000  of
proceeds of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans in the aggregate may be used for
the purposes described in clause (a) of this Section 7.08.

            (c) No part of any Credit  Event (or the proceeds  thereof)  will be
used to purchase or carry any Margin  Stock or to extend  credit for the purpose
of purchasing  or carrying any Margin Stock.  Neither the making of any Loan nor
the use of the  proceeds  thereof nor the  occurrence  of any other Credit Event
will violate or be  inconsistent  with the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

            7.09 TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS.  Each of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries  has timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the appropriate
taxing authority all federal and state income tax returns and all other material
tax returns,  domestic and foreign (the  "Returns")  required to be filed by, or
with respect to the income, properties or operations of, the Borrower and/or any
of its Subsidiaries. The Returns accurately reflect in all material respects all
liability for taxes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered
thereby.  Each of the Borrower and each of its  Subsidiaries  has paid all taxes
and  assessments  payable by it which have become due, other than those that are
being contested in good faith and adequately disclosed and fully provided for as
a reserve on the financial  statements of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.  There is no material
action, suit, proceeding,  investigation,  audit or claim now pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Borrower,  threatened by any authority regarding any taxes
relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the Initial Borrowing
Date,  neither the  Borrower  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has entered  into an
agreement  or waiver or been  requested  to enter  into an  agreement  or waiver
extending  any statute of  limitations  relating to the payment or collection of
taxes  of  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries,  or is  aware  of  any
circumstances that would cause the taxable years or other taxable periods of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries not to be subject to the normally applicable
statute of  limitations.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has
incurred,  nor will any of them incur,  any material tax liability in connection
with the  Transaction or any other  transactions  contemplated  hereby (it being
understood that the representation contained in this sentence does not cover any
future tax liabilities of the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  arising as a
result of the operation of their businesses in the ordinary course of business).

            7.10  COMPLIANCE  WITH  ERISA.  Schedule  IV sets  forth,  as of the
Initial  Borrowing  Date,  the name of each  Plan.  Each Plan (and each  related
trust,  insurance contract or fund) is in substantial  compliance with its terms
and with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code;
each Plan (and each  related  trust,  if any) which is intended to be  qualified
under Section  401(a) of the Code has received a  determination  letter from the
Internal  Revenue  Service  to the  effect  that it meets  the  requirements  of
Sections  401(a) and 501(a) of the Code;  neither  the  Borrower  nor any of its
Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates has ever maintained or contributed to, or had
any obligation to maintain or contribute to (or borne any liability with respect

ERISA,  that is subject to  Section  412 of the Code or Section  302 of ERISA or
Title IV of ERISA;  neither the  Borrower nor any of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA
Affiliates  has ever  maintained  or  contributed  to, or had any  obligation to
maintain or contribute  to (or borne any liability  with respect to) any Foreign

been timely made;  neither the Borrower nor any  Subsidiary  of the Borrower nor
any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability (including any indirect,
contingent  or  secondary  liability)  to or on  account of a Plan  pursuant  to
Section 409, 502(i),  502(l),  515, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or expects to incur any such liability under any of the foregoing  sections
with respect to any Plan; no condition  exists which presents a material risk to
the  Borrower  or any  Subsidiary  of the  Borrower  or any ERISA  Affiliate  of
incurring  a  liability  to or on account of a Plan  pursuant  to the  foregoing
provisions of ERISA and the Code; no action, suit, proceeding, hearing, audit or
investigation with respect to the administration, operation or the investment of
assets of any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending, expected
or threatened;  each group health plan (as defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA or

                                      -39-

operated in compliance with the provisions of the Health  Insurance  Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations  promulgated  thereunder;  no
lien  imposed  under  the Code or ERISA on the  assets  of the  Borrower  or any
Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA  Affiliate  exists or is likely to arise
on  account  of any  Plan;  and the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  may  cease
contributions  to or terminate  any employee  benefit plan  maintained by any of
them without incurring any material liability.

            7.11 THE  SECURITY  DOCUMENTS.  (a) The  provisions  of the Security
Agreement  are  effective  to  create in favor of the  Collateral  Agent for the
benefit  of the  Secured  Creditors  a legal,  valid  and  enforceable  security
interest in all right,  title and interest of the Credit Parties in the Security
Agreement  Collateral  described  therein,  and the  Collateral  Agent,  for the
benefit of the Secured  Creditors,  has (or within 5 days  following the Initial
Borrowing  Date will have) a fully  perfected  security  interest  in all right,
title  and  interest  in all  of the  Security  Agreement  Collateral  described
therein,  subject to no other Liens other than Permitted  Liens. The recordation
of (x) the Grant of Security  Interest in U.S. Patents,  if applicable,  and (y)
the  Grant of  Security  Interest  in U.S.  Trademarks,  if  applicable,  in the
respective form attached to the Security  Agreement,  in each case in the United
States  Patent and  Trademark  Office,  together with filings on Form UCC-1 made
pursuant to the Security  Agreement,  will  create,  as may be perfected by such
filings and  recordation,  a perfected  security  interest in the United  States
trademarks and patents covered by the Security Agreement, and the recordation of
the Grant of Security Interest in U.S.  Copyrights,  if applicable,  in the form
attached to the Security  Agreement  with the United  States  Copyright  Office,

will create,  as may be perfected by such filings and  recordation,  a perfected
security  interest  in the United  States  copyrights  covered  by the  Security
Agreement.

            (b) The security  interests  created  under the Pledge  Agreement in
favor of the  Collateral  Agent,  as  Pledgee,  for the  benefit of the  Secured
Creditors,  constitute  perfected  security  interests  in the Pledge  Agreement
Collateral  described in the Pledge Agreement,  subject to no security interests
of any other Person.  No filings or recordings  are required in order to perfect
(or maintain the  perfection or priority of) the security  interests  created in
the  Pledge  Agreement  Collateral  under the Pledge  Agreement  other than with
respect to that  portion  of the  Pledge  Agreement  Collateral  constituting  a
"general intangible" under the UCC.

            (c) Each Mortgage creates, as security for the obligations purported
to be secured thereby,  a valid and enforceable  perfected  security interest in
and  mortgage  lien  on  the  respective  Mortgaged  Property  in  favor  of the
Collateral  Agent (or such other  trustee as may be  required  or desired  under
local law) for the benefit of the Secured  Creditors,  superior and prior to the
rights of all third Persons (except that the security interest and mortgage lien
created on such Mortgaged Property may be subject to the Permitted  Encumbrances

of  its  property   (including,   without   limitation,   applicable   statutes,
regulations,  orders and restrictions  relating to  environmental  standards and
controls),  except such  noncompliances as could not, either  individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            7.16  INVESTMENT  COMPANY  ACT.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its

treated or stored on, or  transported  to or from,  or Released on or from,  any
Real  Property  owned,  leased  or  operated  by  the  Borrower  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries  or, to the  knowledge of the Borrower,  any property  adjoining or
adjacent to any Real Property, where such generation,  use, treatment,  storage,
transportation  or Release has (i) violated or could be  reasonably  expected to
violate any  applicable  Environmental  Law, (ii) give rise to an  Environmental
Claim or (iii) give rise to liability under any applicable Environmental Law.

            (c)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section 7.18,
the  representations  and  warranties  made in this Section 7.18 shall be untrue
only if the effect of any or all conditions,  violations,  claims, restrictions,
failures  and  noncompliances  of  the  types  described  above  could,   either
individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            7.19  LABOR   RELATIONS.   Neither  the  Borrower  nor  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  is engaged in any unfair labor  practice that could  reasonably be
expected,  either  individually or in the aggregate,  to have a Material Adverse
Effect.  There is (i) no unfair labor  practice  complaint  pending  against the
Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or,  to the  knowledge  of the  Borrower,
threatened  against any of them,  before the National Labor Relations Board, and
no grievance or  arbitration  proceeding  arising out of or under any collective
bargaining  agreement  is  so  pending  against  the  Borrower  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  or, to the  knowledge of the Borrower,  threatened  against any of
them, (ii) no strike,  labor dispute,  slowdown or stoppage  pending against the
Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or,  to the  knowledge  of the  Borrower,
threatened  against  the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  (iii) no union
representation  question exists with respect to the employees of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries and (iv) no collective bargaining agreement exists which
is binding on the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries;  except (with respect to
any  matter  specified  in  clause  (i),  (ii)  (iii)  or  (iv)  above,   either
individually  or in the  aggregate)  such as could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  charges  or other  claim of
employment  discrimination  pending or, to the Borrower's  knowledge,  currently
threatened  against  them that would  reasonably  be expected to have a Material

                                      -42-

<PAGE>



Adverse Effect;  no wage and hour department  investigation has been made of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries  that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material  Adverse  Effect;  there are no  occupational  health and safety claims
against  the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  that  would  reasonably  be
expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Since the enactment of the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") neither the Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the
WARN  Act)  affecting  any  site  of  employment  or one or more  facilities  or
operating units within any site of employment or facility of the Borrower or any
of its  Subsidiaries;  or (ii) a "mass  layoff"  (as  defined  in the WARN  Act)
affecting  any site of  employment  or  facility  of the  Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries;  nor has the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries  been affected by
any transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment  terminations  sufficient in
number to trigger  application  of any similar  state or local law.  Neither the
Borrower  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has  suffered an  "employment  loss" (as
defined in the WARN Act) since six (6) months prior to the date hereof;  and the
Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  are in compliance in all material  respects with
the terms and provisions of the  Immigration  Reform and Control Act of 1986, as
amended, and all related regulations promulgated thereunder.

            7.20 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) Each of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries owns or has the right to use all the patents, trademarks,  permits,
domain names,  service marks,  trade names,  copyrights,  licenses,  franchises,
inventions,  trade secrets,  proprietary  information  and know-how of any type,
whether or not  written  (including,  but not  limited  to,  rights in  computer
programs and  databases)  and formulas,  or rights with respect to the foregoing
(collectively,  "INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY"),  and has obtained  assignments of all
leases, licenses and other rights of whatever nature,  necessary for the present
conduct of its  business,  without any known  conflict with the rights of others
which, or the failure to obtain which,  as the case may be, could  reasonably be
expected,  either  individually or in the aggregate,  to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

            (b) The  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  have the right to practice
under and use all of its Intellectual Property.

            (c) Neither the Borrower nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has knowledge
of any claim by any third party contesting the validity,  enforceability, use or
ownership of the Intellectual  Property,  or of any existing state of facts that
would support a claim that use by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any
such Intellectual  Property has infringed or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property  right of any other  Person and, to the best  knowledge of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries, no such claim is threatened.

            7.21 INDEBTEDNESS. Schedule V sets forth a true and complete list of
all  Indebtedness  (including  Contingent  Obligations)  of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries  as of the  Initial  Borrowing  Date  (after  giving  effect to the
Refinancing,  but  excluding  the  Loans,  the  Letters of Credit and the Senior
Subordinated  Notes,  the  "Existing  Indebtedness")  and  which  is  to  remain
outstanding  after giving  effect to the  Transaction,  in each case showing the
aggregate  principal amount thereof and the name of the respective  borrower and
any  Credit  Party  or any of its  Subsidiaries  which  directly  or  indirectly
guarantees such debt.

                                      -43-

            7.22 INSURANCE.  Schedule VI sets forth a true and complete  listing
of all  insurance  maintained  by the  Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  as of the
Initial Borrowing Date, with the amounts insured (and any deductibles) set forth
therein.

            7.23   REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES  IN  OTHER  DOCUMENTS.   All
representations  and warranties  set forth in the other  Documents were true and
correct in all  material  respects at the time as of which such  representations
and  warranties  were made (or deemed made) and shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the Initial Borrowing Date as if such representations or
warranties were made on and as of such date (it being understood and agreed that
any such representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified
date shall be true and correct in all  material  respects  as of such  specified
date).

            7.24 SUBORDINATION.  The subordination  provisions  contained in the
Senior Subordinated Note Documents are enforceable against the Borrower, each of
its  Subsidiaries  and the  holders  of the  Senior  Subordinated  Notes and all
Obligations  hereunder and under the other Credit  Documents and all obligations
arising  pursuant to the  Interest  Rate  Protection  Agreements  are within the
definition of "Senior Debt" included in such subordination provisions.

            SECTION 8. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.  The Borrower hereby covenants and
agrees that on and after the Effective  Date and until the Total  Commitment and
all Letters of Credit have  terminated and the Loans,  Notes and Unpaid Drawings
(in each case together with interest  thereon),  Fees and all other  Obligations
(other than  indemnities  described in Section  13.13 which are not then due and
payable) incurred hereunder and thereunder, are paid in full:

such  environmental  matters,  could  reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect:

            (i) any  pending  or  threatened  Environmental  Claim  against  the

      the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  of such Real Property  under any
      Environmental Law; and

      Subsidiaries from any government or governmental agency under, or pursuant
      to,  CERCLA  which  identify the  Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  as
      potentially  responsible  parties for remediation costs or which otherwise
      notify the  Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  of  potential  liability
      under CERCLA.

All such notices shall  describe in  reasonable  detail the nature of the claim,
investigation,  condition,  occurrence  or  removal or  remedial  action and the

Subsidiaries   as  the   Administrative   Agent  or  any  Lender   (through  the
Administrative Agent) may reasonably request.

            8.02  BOOKS,  RECORDS  AND  INSPECTIONS;  ANNUAL  MEETINGS.  (a) The
Borrower will, and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of
record and accounts in which full,  true and correct  entries in conformity with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles and all requirements of law shall be
made  of  all  dealings  and  transactions  in  relation  to  its  business  and
activities.  The  Borrower  will,  and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries  to,

                                      -47-

<PAGE>



permit officers and designated  representatives of the  Administrative  Agent or
any Lender to visit and inspect,  under  guidance of officers of the Borrower or
such Subsidiary,  any of the properties of the Borrower or such Subsidiary,  and
to examine the books of account of the Borrower or such  Subsidiary  and discuss
the affairs,  finances and accounts of the Borrower or such Subsidiary with, and
be  advised  as  to  the  same  by,  its  and  their  officers  and  independent
accountants,  all upon reasonable  prior notice and at such reasonable times and
intervals and to such reasonable extent as the Administrative  Agent or any such
Lender may reasonably request.

            (b) At a date to be mutually agreed upon between the  Administrative
Agent and the Borrower occurring on or prior to the 120th day after the close of
each fiscal  year of the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  will,  at the request of the
Administrative  Agent or the  Required  Lenders,  hold a meeting with all of the
Lenders at which meeting will be reviewed the financial  results of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries for the previous fiscal year and the budgets  presented for
the current fiscal year of the Borrower.

            8.03 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY;  INSURANCE. (a) The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries  to, (i) keep all property  necessary to the
business  of the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  in  good  working  order  and
condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, (ii) maintain with financially sound
and reputable insurance companies insurance on all such property and against all
such  risks as is  consistent  and in  accordance  with  industry  practice  for
companies  similarly  situated owning similar  properties and engaged in similar
businesses  as the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries,  and (iii)  furnish  to the
Administrative  Agent,  upon its request  therefor,  full  information as to the
insurance carried. In addition to the requirements of the immediately  preceding
sentence,  the Borrower will at all times cause insurance of the types described
in  Schedule  VI to be  maintained  (with  the same  scope of  coverage  as that
described in Schedule VI) at levels which are  consistent  with their  practices
immediately  before the Initial  Borrowing  Date.  Such insurance  shall include
physical damage insurance on all real and personal  property  (whether now owned
or hereafter  acquired)  (including with respect to disaster recovery) on an all
risk basis. The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be deemed supplemental to,
but not  duplicative  of, the provisions of any Security  Documents that require
the  maintenance  of  insurance.  In addition  to the  foregoing,  the  Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that (x) the  Administrative  Agent has the right, on an
annual basis, to review the insurance then being  maintained by the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries  and to require the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries to increase
their  levels of  coverage  from that which then  exists to the extent  that the
Administrative  Agent has a  reasonable  basis to require  same and (y) it will,
within 30 days following such a request by the Administrative Agent, obtain such
increased insurance coverage.

            (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries  to,
at all times keep its property insured in favor of the Collateral Agent, and all
policies or  certificates  (or  certified  copies  thereof) with respect to such
insurance  (and any other  insurance  maintained  by the  Borrower  and/or  such
Subsidiaries) (i) shall be endorsed to the Collateral  Agent's  satisfaction for
the benefit of the Collateral Agent (including,  without  limitation,  by naming
the Collateral Agent as loss payee and/or additional insured),  (ii) shall state
that such  insurance  policies  shall not be canceled  without at least 30 days'
prior written notice thereof by the respective  insurer to the Collateral Agent,
(iii) shall provide that the respective  insurers  irrevocably waive any and all
rights of subrogation with respect to the Collateral Agent and the other Secured
Creditors, and (iv) shall be deposited with the Collateral Agent.

                                      -48-

<PAGE>



            (c)  If the  Borrower  or any of  its  Subsidiaries  shall  fail  to
maintain  insurance in accordance  with this Section 8.03, or if the Borrower or
any of its  Subsidiaries  shall fail to so endorse and  deposit all  policies or
certificates with respect thereto, the Administrative Agent shall have the right
(but shall be under no  obligation)  to procure such  insurance and the Borrower
agrees  to  reimburse  the  Administrative  Agent for all  reasonable  costs and
expenses of procuring such insurance.

            8.04 EXISTENCE;  FRANCHISES.  The Borrower will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done, all things necessary to preserve
and keep in full  force  and  effect  its  existence  and its  material  rights,
franchises,  licenses,  permits,  copyrights,  trademarks and patents (and other
Intellectual  Property);  provided,  however,  that nothing in this Section 8.04
shall prevent (i) sales of assets and other  transactions by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 9.02, (ii) the abandonment by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any copyrights, trademarks or patents (or
other  Intellectual  Property) which the Borrower  reasonably  determines are no
longer material to the operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries  taken as
a whole or (iii) the  withdrawal by the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries  of
its  qualification as a foreign  corporation,  partnership or limited  liability
company,  as the case may be, in any  jurisdiction if such withdrawal could not,
either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            8.05  COMPLIANCE  WITH  STATUTES,  ETC. The Borrower  will, and will
cause  each  of its  Subsidiaries  to,  comply  with  all  applicable  statutes,
regulations  and orders  of, and all  applicable  restrictions  imposed  by, all
governmental  bodies,  domestic  or  foreign,  in respect of the  conduct of its
business  and the  ownership  of its property  (including  applicable  statutes,
regulations,  orders and restrictions  relating to  environmental  standards and
controls),  except such  noncompliances as could not, either  individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            8.06  COMPLIANCE  WITH  ENVIRONMENTAL  LAWS.  (a) The Borrower  will

Agent  appraisals  which satisfy the applicable  requirements of the Real Estate

Administrative Agent, the Required Lender or a given Lender, as the case may be;
provided  that,  in no event will the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries  be

consents  from third  parties with respect to its  compliance  with this Section
8.12.

cause  each of its  Subsidiaries  to,  own 100% of the  capital  stock and other
equity interests of each of their Subsidiaries (other than directors' qualifying
shares to the extent required by applicable law).

            8.14 INTEREST RATE  PROTECTION.  No later than 90 days following the
Initial  Borrowing Date, the Borrower will enter into (and thereafter  maintain)

Administrative Agent, with a term of at least three years,  establishing a fixed
or maximum interest rate acceptable to the Administrative Agent for an aggregate
notional amount equal to at least 50% of the aggregate  principal  amount of the
Term Loans  outstanding  at the time the  Borrower  enters  into the  respective
Interest Rate Protection Agreement.

            8.15 MONTHLY REPORTING REQUIREMENT. Within thirty (30) Business Days
after the end of each month,  the Borrower  will  deliver to the  Administrative
Agent for  distribution  to the Lenders a monthly  report,  in the same form and

requirements of this Section 8.15.

Section  8.16 and the  requirements  contained  in the  definition  of Permitted
Acquisition,  the  Borrower and each  Wholly-Owned  Domestic  Subsidiary  of the
Borrower which is a Subsidiary  Guarantor may from time to time after  September

extent the Required Lenders otherwise  specifically agree in writing in the case
of a specific Permitted  Acquisition):  (i) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing at the time of the  consummation of the proposed
Permitted  Acquisition  or  immediately  after giving effect  thereto;  (ii) the
Borrower shall have given to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders at least
10 Business  Days' prior written  notice of any Permitted  Acquisition  (or such
shorter  period of time as may be reasonably  acceptable  to the  Administrative

Borrower  with respect to the  financial  covenants  contained in Sections  9.08

Period on a Pro Forma Basis as if the respective Permitted  Acquisition (as well
as all other Permitted Acquisitions  theretofore consummated after the first day
of such  Calculation  Period) had occurred on the first day of such  Calculation
Period,  and such  calculations  shall show that such financial  covenants would
have been complied with if the Permitted  Acquisition  had occurred on the first
day of such Calculation Period; (iv) based on good faith projections prepared by
the Borrower for the period from the date of the  consummation of the respective
Permitted  Acquisition  to the date which is one year  thereafter,  the level of
financial  performance measured by the financial covenants set forth in Sections
9.08 through 9.12,  inclusive,  and 9.13 (if applicable) shall be better than or
equal to such level as would be required to provide  that no Default or Event of
Default  would exist under the  financial  covenants  contained in such Sections
9.08 through 9.12,  inclusive,  and 9.13 (if applicable) as compliance with such
financial  covenants  would be required  through the date which is one year from
the date of the consummation of the respective  Permitted  Acquisition;  (v) all
representations  and  warranties  contained  herein  and  in  the  other  Credit
Documents  shall be true and  correct  in all  material  respects  with the same
effect as though such  representations and warranties had been made on and as of
the date of such  Permitted  Acquisition  (both before and after  giving  effect
thereto), unless stated to relate to a specific earlier date, in which case such
representations  and  warranties  shall  be true  and  correct  in all  material
respects as of such earlier date; (vi) the aggregate  consideration  (including,
without  limitation,  (I) the  aggregate  principal  amount of any  Indebtedness
assumed,  refinanced,  incurred or issued in  connection  therewith and (II) the
aggregate  amount paid and  reasonably  expected to be paid (based on good faith

Acquisitions  theretofore  consummated  during such fiscal year, does not exceed
the  Permitted  Acquisition  Basket  Amount  for such  fiscal  year;  (vii)  the
aggregate  amount of deferred  compensation  or other  deferred  purchase  price
(including any earn-outs)  paid in any fiscal year of the Borrower in respect of
all Permitted  Acquisitions  (whether or not such  Permitted  Acquisitions  were
consummated  during such  fiscal  year)  shall not exceed  $1,000,000  (it being
understood and agreed,  however,  that any such deferred  compensation  or other
deferred  purchase  price  (including  any  earn-outs)  shall be structured as a
multiple of the excess of the cash flow of the Acquired  Entity or Business that
is the subject of the  respective  Permitted  Acquisition  for the most recently
ended 12-month  period above the cash flow for such Acquired  Entity or Business
for such  12-month  period  selected to determine  the  purchase  price for such
Permitted  Acquisition);  and (viii) the  Borrower  shall have  delivered to the

thereof created or acquired in connection with such Permitted  Acquisition shall
be pledged  for the  benefit of the  Secured  Creditors  pursuant to (and to the
extent required by) the Pledge Agreement.

to execute and deliver all of the  documentation  as and to the extent  required
by, Sections 8.12 and 9.18, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative
Agent. (d) The consummation of each Permitted  Acquisition shall be deemed to be
a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the  certifications  pursuant
to this Section 8.16 are true and correct and that all  conditions  thereto have
been  satisfied and that same is permitted in accordance  with the terms of this
Agreement,   which   representation  and  warranty  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a

      not in the aggregate  materially  detract from the value of the Borrower's

      forfeiture or sale of the property or assets subject to any such Lien;

            (iii) Liens in  existence  on the Initial  Borrowing  Date which are
      listed, and the property subject thereto  described,  in Schedule VII, but

            (v)  licenses,  sublicenses,  leases or  subleases  granted to other

      subject to Capitalized  Lease  Obligations to the extent such  Capitalized
      Lease  Obligations are permitted by Section  9.04(iii),  provided that (x)
      such Liens only serve to secure the payment of Indebtedness  arising under
      such  Capitalized  Lease Obligation and (y) the Lien encumbering the asset
      giving rise to the  Capitalized  Lease  Obligation  does not  encumber any
      other asset of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower;

            12.03 LACK OF RELIANCE ON THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT.  Independently

the  continuance  of the Loans and the  taking  or not  taking of any  action in
connection  herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the  creditworthiness  of the
Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  and,  except  as  expressly  provided  in this

times  thereafter.  The  Administrative  Agent shall not be  responsible  to any
Lender or the  holder  of any Note for any  recitals,  statements,  information,

respect to any act or action (including  failure to act) in connection with this
Agreement  or any other  Credit  Document,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall be
entitled to refrain  from such act or taking  such  action  unless and until the

any other Credit Document and its duties  hereunder and thereunder,  upon advice
of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent.

against  any and  all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,
claims, actions,  judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind
or  nature  which  may be  imposed  on,  asserted  against  or  incurred  by the
Administrative  Agent  (or any  affiliate  thereof)  in  performing  its  duties
hereunder  or under any  other  Credit  Document  or in any way  relating  to or
arising out of this  Agreement or any other Credit  Document;  provided  that no

respect to its  obligation to make Loans,  or issue or participate in Letters of
Credit, under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and
powers  specified  herein for a "Lender"  and may  exercise  the same rights and
powers as though it were not performing  the duties  specified  herein;  and the
term "Lender,"  "Required  Lenders," "Required Senior Lenders," "Required B Term
Loan Lenders," "holders of Notes" or any similar terms shall, unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise,  include the Administrative Agent in its respective
individual  capacities.  The Administrative  Agent and its affiliates may accept
deposits  from,  lend money to,  and  generally  engage in any kind of  banking,
investment  banking,  trust or other business  with, or provide debt  financing,
equity capital or other services (including  financial advisory services) to any
Credit Party or any  Affiliate  of any Credit Party (or any Person  engaged in a
similar business with any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof) as if they were
not  performing  the duties  specified  herein,  and may  accept  fees and other
consideration  from any Credit  Party or any  Affiliate  of any Credit Party for
services in  connection  with this  Agreement and  otherwise  without  having to
account for the same to the Lenders.

            12.08 HOLDERS. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner  thereof  for all  purposes  hereof  unless and until a
written notice of the assignment,  transfer or endorsement  thereof, as the case
may be,  shall have been  filed  with the  Administrative  Agent.  Any  request,
authority  or consent of any Person who,  at the time of making such  request or
giving such authority or consent,  is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder,  transferee,  assignee or endorsee, as the
case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

            12.09   RESIGNATION   BY   THE   ADMINISTRATIVE   AGENT.   (a)   The
Administrative  Agent may  resign  from the  performance  of all its  respective
functions and duties  hereunder  and/or under the other Credit  Documents at any
time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Lenders and, unless
a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 then exists,  the Borrower.
Any such resignation by an Administrative  Agent hereunder shall also constitute
its resignation as an Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, in which case the
resigning  Administrative  Agent (x) shall not be  required to issue any further
Letters of Credit or make any additional Swingline Loans hereunder and (y) shall

the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or
thereunder who shall be a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable

(provided  that the  Borrower's  approval  shall not be  required if an Event of
Default then exists).

            (c) If a  successor  Administrative  Agent  shall  not have  been so
appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the
consent of the Borrower  (which  consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed,  provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be required if an Event
of Default then exists), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall serve as Administrative  Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if
any,  as the  Required  Lenders  appoint  a  successor  Administrative  Agent as
provided above.

            (d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant
to clause (b) or (c) above by the 20th  Business  Day after the date such notice

other Credit Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

Section 12.09, the  Administrative  Agent shall remain indemnified to the extent
provided in this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents and the provisions of
this Section 12 shall  continue in effect for the benefit of the  Administrative
Agent for all of its actions and inactions  while serving as the  Administrative
Agent.

telegraphed,  telexed, telecopied,  cabled or delivered: if to any Credit Party,
at the address  specified  opposite its signature below or in the other relevant

or  sent by  overnight  courier,  be  effective  when  deposited  in the  mails,
delivered to the telegraph company,  cable company or overnight courier,  as the
case  may  be,  or  sent  by  telex  or  telecopier,  except  that  notices  and
communications  to the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Borrower  shall  not be
effective  until received by the  Administrative  Agent or the Borrower,  as the
case may be.

            13.04 BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT;  ASSIGNMENTS;  PARTICIPATIONS.  (a) This
Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be  enforceable
by the  respective  successors  and  assigns of the  parties  hereto;  provided,
however, the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights,  obligations
or interest  hereunder  without the prior  written  consent of the Lenders  and,
provided  further,  that,  although  any  Lender may  transfer,  assign or grant
participations in its rights hereunder,  such Lender shall remain a "LENDER" for
all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or assign all or any portion of its
Commitments  hereunder except as provided in Sections 1.13 and 13.04(b)) and the
transferee,  assignee or participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a

                                     -104-

<PAGE>



"Lender" hereunder and, provided further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant
any  participation  under which the participant shall have rights to approve any
amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit  Document except to
the  extent  such  amendment  or waiver  would (i)  extend  the final  scheduled
maturity of any Loan,  Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is
not extended beyond the Revolving Loan Maturity Date) in which such  participant
is  participating,  or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
or Fees thereon  (except in  connection  with a waiver of  applicability  of any
post-default  increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof
(it  being  understood  that any  amendment  or  modification  to the  financial
definitions  in this  Agreement or to Section  13.07(a)  shall not  constitute a
reduction  in the rate of interest or Fees payable  hereunder),  or increase the
amount of the participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect
(it being  understood  that a waiver of any  Default or Event of Default or of a
mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the
terms of such  participation,  and that an  increase in any  Commitment  (or the
available portion thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any
participant  if the  participant's  participation  is not  increased as a result
thereof),  (ii) consent to the  assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of
its  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (iii)  except  during the
continuance  of an Event of  Default  (at  which  time  the  Collateral  release
provisions  shall  instead be governed  by the  provisions  of Section  14.02(a)
hereof) or as otherwise  expressly provided in the Security  Documents,  release
all or  substantially  all of the  Collateral  under all the Security  Documents
supporting the Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder in which such participant is
participating,  (iv) amend,  modify or waive any  provision of Section  4.02(h),
Section 13.06(d),  Section 13.12 or Section 14 (except for technical  amendments
with respect to additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement which
afford  the  protections  to such  additional  extensions  of credit of the type
provided to the A Term Loans, B Term Loans and/or the Revolving Loan Commitments
on the Effective Date), (v) except during the continuance of an Event of Default
(at which time the  Subsidiaries  Guaranty  release  provisions shall instead be
governed by the provisions of Section  14.02(b)),  release all or  substantially
all of the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  from  the  Subsidiaries  Guaranty,  or  (vi)
contractually  subordinate  the right of payment of any Lender to any principal,
interest  (other than the  difference  between the standard rate of interest and
the default rate of interest) or fees payable by the Borrower for the account of
such Lender to any other  Indebtedness of the Borrower,  supporting the Loans or
Letters of Credit hereunder in which such participant is  participating.  In the
case of any such participation,  the participant shall not have any rights under
this Agreement or any of the other Credit  Documents (the  participant's  rights
against  such Lender in respect of such  participation  to be those set forth in
the  agreement  executed  by such  Lender in favor of the  participant  relating
thereto) and all amounts  payable by the Borrower  hereunder shall be determined
as if such Lender had not sold such participation.

            (b)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  Lender  (or  any  Lender
together with one or more other  Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its
Commitments and related  outstanding  Obligations  (or, if the Commitments  with
respect  to the  relevant  Tranche  have  terminated,  outstanding  Obligations)
hereunder to (i)(A) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which
is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company or (B) to one or more
other  Lenders or any  affiliate  of any such other Lender which is at least 50%
owned by such other Lender or its parent  company  (provided  that any fund that
invests in loans and is managed  or  advised by the same  investment  advisor of
another fund which is a Lender (or by an Affiliate of such  investment  advisor)
shall be treated as an  affiliate  of such other Lender for the purposes of this

                                     -105-

<PAGE>



sub-clause  (x)(i)(B)),  or (ii) in the case of any  Lender  that is a fund that
invests in loans, any other fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised
by the  same  investment  advisor  of any  Lender  or by an  Affiliate  of  such
investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at
least $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders,
of such Commitments and related outstanding  Obligations (or, if the Commitments
with respect to the relevant Tranche have terminated,  outstanding  Obligations)
hereunder to one or more Eligible Transferees (treating any fund that invests in
loans and any other fund that  invests in loans and is managed or advised by the
same  investment  advisor  of such fund or by an  Affiliate  of such  investment
advisor as a single Eligible Transferee), each of which assignees shall become a
party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement,  provided that (i) at such time,  Schedule I shall be deemed modified
to reflect the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of such
new Lender and of the existing Lenders,  (ii) upon the surrender of the relevant
Notes by the assigning Lender (or, upon such assigning Lender's indemnifying the
Borrower for any lost Note  pursuant to a customary  indemnification  agreement)
new Notes will be issued, at the Borrower's  expense,  to such new Lender and to
the  assigning  Lender upon the request of such new Lender or assigning  Lender,
such new Notes to be in conformity  with the  requirements of Section 1.05 (with
appropriate   modifications)  to  the  extent  needed  to  reflect  the  revised
Commitments  and/or  outstanding  Loans,  as the case may be,  (iii)  subject to
Section  14.01(b),  the consent of the  Administrative  Agent and, so long as no
Default or Event of Default then exists,  the consent of the Borrower  shall (in
either  case) be required in  connection  with any such  assignment  pursuant to
clause (y) above (other than any such assignment by the Administrative  Agent or
any of its Affiliates  prior to the Syndication  Date) (which  consents,  in any
such  case,   shall  not  be  unreasonably   withheld  or  delayed),   (iv)  the
Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the
assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable  assignment fee of
$3,500 and (v) no such transfer or assignment  will be effective  until recorded
by the  Administrative  Agent on the Register  pursuant to Section 13.15. To the
extent of any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b), the assigning Lender
shall be relieved of its  obligations  hereunder  with  respect to its  assigned
Commitments  and outstanding  Loans. At the time of each assignment  pursuant to
this Section  13.04(b) to a Person which is not already a Lender  hereunder  and
which  is not a United  States  person  (as  such  term is  defined  in  Section
7701(a)(30)  of the  Code) for  Federal  income  tax  purposes,  the  respective
assignee Lender shall,  to the extent legally  entitled to do so, provide to the
Borrower the appropriate  Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable,  a
Section  4.04(b)(ii)  Certificate)  described in Section 4.04(b).  To the extent
that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's  Commitments  and related
outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 1.13 or this Section 13.04(b) would,
at the time of such  assignment,  result in increased  costs under Section 1.10,
2.06 or 4.04 from those being charged by the respective  assigning  Lender prior
to such  assignment,  then  the  Borrower  shall  not be  obligated  to pay such
increased costs  (although the Borrower,  in accordance with and pursuant to the
other  provisions  of this  Agreement,  shall  be  obligated  to pay  any  other
increased  costs of the type  described  above  resulting from changes after the
date of the respective assignment).

            (c) Nothing in this  Agreement  shall prevent or prohibit any Lender
from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support
of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, with prior
notification  to the  Administrative  Agent  (but  without  the  consent  of the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower), any Lender which is a fund may pledge all

                                     -106-

<PAGE>



or any  portion of its Loans and Notes to its trustee or to a  collateral  agent
providing  credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations
to such trustee,  such collateral agent or a holder of such obligations,  as the
case may be. No pledge  pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.

            13.05 NO  WAIVER;  REMEDIES  CUMULATIVE.  No failure or delay on the
part of the  Administrative  Agent, the Collateral  Agent, any Issuing Lender or
any Lender in exercising  any right,  power or privilege  hereunder or under any
other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any other
Credit Party and the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent, any Issuing
Lender or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof;  nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right,  power or privilege  hereunder or under any other
Credit Document  preclude any other or further  exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right,  power or privilege  hereunder  or  thereunder.  The rights,
powers and remedies  herein or in any other Credit Document  expressly  provided
are  cumulative  and not exclusive of any rights,  powers or remedies  which the
Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent,  any Issuing Lender or any Lender
would  otherwise  have.  No notice to or demand on any Credit  Party in any case
shall  entitle  any  Credit  Party to any other or  further  notice or demand in
similar  or other  circumstances  or  constitute  a waiver of the  rights of the
Administrative  Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to
any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

            13.06  PAYMENTS PRO RATA.  (a) Except as otherwise  provided in this
Agreement,  the  Administrative  Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of
each  payment  from or on behalf of the  Borrower in respect of any  Obligations
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders
entitled  thereto  (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive
its pro rata share of any such  payment)  pro rata  based upon their  respective
shares,  if any,  of the  Obligations  with  respect to which such  payment  was
received.

            (b) If any Lender (herein the "BENEFITED LENDER"), by exercising any
right of set-off, counterclaim or foreclosure,  receives payment (whether in the
form of cash or other  property) of principal or interest or other amount due on
any Obligation (other than payments  distributed to such Benefited Lender by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.06(d)) (the
"ENTRUSTED  PROPERTY"),   such  Benefited  Lender  shall  promptly  deliver  the
Entrusted  Property  to  the   Administrative   Agent  for  application  to  the
Obligations  in accordance  with the provisions of Section  13.06(d);  provided,
that, until such Entrusted Property is so delivered to the Administrative Agent,
it shall be deemed to be held in trust by such Benefited  Lender for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent and the Entitled Lenders (defined hereafter). If any
Benefited  Lender  fails  to  promptly  turn  over  Entrusted  Property  to  the
Administrative  Agent,  such Benefited  Lender shall be deemed to have purchased
(from all  Lenders who would be entitled  to a  distribution  of such  Entrusted
Property from the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.06(d);  herein the
"Entitled Lenders") participations in the applicable Loans held by such Entitled
Lenders  (and such other  adjustments  shall be made as may be required) so that
all such  Entrusted  Property  shall be  effectively  attributed to the Entitled
Lenders in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.06(d);  provided,  that,
if all or any portion of such Entrusted  Property is thereafter  recovered from,
or must  otherwise be restored  by, the  Benefited  Lender,  or is repaid by the
Benefited Lender in good faith  settlement of a pending or threatened  avoidance
claim,  the purchase of such  participation  shall be rescinded and the purchase

                                     -107-

<PAGE>



price restored to the extent of such recovery,  but without  interest being paid
by such  Benefited  Lender.  If under any applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency or
other  similar law, any Benefited  Lender  receives a secured claim in lieu of a
set-off to which this Section would apply,  such Benefited  Lender shall, to the
extent  practicable,  exercise its rights in respect of such secured  claim in a
manner  consistent with the rights provided herein of the Entitled  Lenders,  as
directed by the  Administrative  Agent. Each Credit Party agrees that any Lender
purchasing  a  participation  from any other  Lender  pursuant  to this  Section
13.06(b) may, to the fullest extent  permitted by law, and  notwithstanding  the
provisions of Section  13.04,  exercise all of its rights of payment  (including
the right of set-off)  with  respect to such  participation  as fully as if such
purchasing Lender were the direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of
such participation.

            (c)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions  of the preceding  Sections  13.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the
express  provisions  of this  Agreement  which  require,  or  permit,  differing
payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.

            (d) So long as the Senior Loan Maturity  Date has not occurred,  the
Obligations  have not been  accelerated  and no Default or Event of Default  has
occurred under Section 10.05, the Credit Parties, the Administrative  Agent, the
Collateral  Agent and each other  Secured  Creditor  agree that all  payments on
account of the Obligations  (including all collections on any Collateral)  shall
be  applied  to the  payment  of the then due and  payable  amount of the Senior
Obligations  and of  the  then  due  and  payable  amount  of  the B  Term  Loan
Obligations,  pro rata in accordance with their respective  amounts then due and
payable.  Upon the occurrence of the Senior Loan Maturity Date, the acceleration
of the  Obligations  or the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under
Section 10.05,  the Credit Parties,  the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral
Agent and each other Secured  Creditor agree that all payments on account of the
Obligations  (including  all  collections  on any  Collateral)  shall be applied
pursuant to Section 7.4 of the Security Agreement.

            13.07 CALCULATIONS; COMPUTATIONS. (a) The financial statements to be
furnished  to the  Lenders  pursuant  hereto  shall  be  made  and  prepared  in
accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the United States
consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the
notes  thereto);  provided that, (i) except as otherwise  specifically  provided
herein,  all computations of Excess Cash Flow and the Applicable Margin, and all
computations  and  all  definitions   (including   accounting   terms)  used  in
determining  compliance  with Sections  8.18 and 9.07 through  9.13,  inclusive,
shall  utilize  generally  accepted   accounting   principles  and  policies  in
conformity  with those used to prepare the audited  financial  statements of the
Borrower  referred to in Section  7.05(a)  for the fiscal  year of the  Borrower
ended June 30, 2002 and (ii) to the extent expressly  provided  herein,  certain
calculations shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis .

            (b) All  computations of interest,  Commitment  Commission and other
Fees  hereunder  shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual
number of days  (including the first day but excluding the last day; except that
in the case of Letter  of Credit  Fees and  Facing  Fees,  the last day shall be
included) occurring in the period for which such interest, Commitment Commission
or Fees are payable.

IN ANY  OTHER  MANNER  PERMITTED  BY LAW OR TO  COMMENCE  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS  OR
OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST THE BORROWER IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

in the definition of Required Senior Lenders, (8) without the written consent of
each B Term Loan Lender,  reduce the  percentage  specified in the definition of
Required B Term Loan  Lenders or (9) without the written  consent of each Senior
Lender,  amend,  modify or waive the provisions of Section  4.01(v),  unless all
Senior Loan Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash.

            (b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination  of any of the  provisions  of this  Agreement  as  contemplated  by
clauses (i) through (v),  inclusive,  of the first proviso to Section  13.12(a),
the consent of the  Required  Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more
of such other  Lenders  whose  consent is  required  is not  obtained,  then the
Borrower  shall  have the right,  so long as all  non-consenting  Lenders  whose
individual consent is required are treated as described in either clauses (A) or
(B) below, to either (A) replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with
one or more Replacement  Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 so long as at the time
of such  replacement,  each such  Replacement  Lender  consents to the  proposed

                                     -111-

<PAGE>



change,  waiver,  discharge or termination or (B) terminate such  non-consenting
Lender's  Commitments  and/or  repay each Tranche of  outstanding  Loans of such
Lender in accordance with Sections 3.02(b) and/or 4.01(b), provided that, unless
the  Commitments  that are terminated,  and Loans repaid,  pursuant to preceding
clause (B) are immediately replaced in full at such time through the addition of
new  Lenders or the  increase of the  Commitments  and/or  outstanding  Loans of
existing Lenders (who in each case must specifically  consent thereto),  then in
the case of any action  pursuant to preceding  clause (B) the  Required  Lenders
(determined  after giving  effect to the  proposed  action)  shall  specifically
consent thereto, provided further, that in any event the Borrower shall not have
the right to  replace a Lender,  terminate  its  Commitments  or repay its Loans
solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's  rights (and the withholding
of any  required  consent by such  Lender)  pursuant  to the  second  proviso to
Section 13.12(a).

            13.13 SURVIVAL. All indemnities set forth herein including,  without
limitation,  in Sections 1.10,  1.11,  2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01 shall survive
the execution,  delivery and termination of this Agreement and the Notes and the
making and repayment of the Obligations.

            13.14  DOMICILE  OF LOANS.  Each Lender may  transfer  and carry its
Loans at, to or for the account of any office,  Subsidiary  or Affiliate of such
Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
that a transfer of Loans  pursuant to this Section  13.14 would,  at the time of
such transfer,  result in increased costs under Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.06 or 4.04
from those being charged by the respective  Lender prior to such transfer,  then
the Borrower  shall not be obligated to pay such increased  costs  (although the
Borrower  shall  be  obligated  to pay any  other  increased  costs  of the type
described  above  resulting  from  changes  after  the  date  of the  respective
transfer).

            13.15 REGISTER.  The Borrower hereby  designates the  Administrative
Agent to serve as its agent,  solely for  purposes  of this  Section  13.15,  to
maintain a register  (the  "REGISTER")  on which it will record the  Commitments
from time to time of each of the Lenders,  the Loans made by each of the Lenders
and each  repayment  in  respect  of the  principal  amount of the Loans of each
Lender. Failure to make any such recordation,  or any error in such recordation,
shall not affect the  Borrower's  obligations  in  respect of such  Loans.  With
respect to any Lender,  the transfer of the  Commitments  of such Lender and the
rights to the  principal  of, and  interest  on, any Loan made  pursuant to such
Commitments  shall not be  effective  until such  transfer  is  recorded  on the
Register  maintained  by the  Administrative  Agent with respect to ownership of
such  Commitments  and Loans and prior to such  recordation all amounts owing to
the transferor with respect to such  Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to
the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any
Commitments  and Loans  shall be  recorded  by the  Administrative  Agent on the
Register  only upon the  acceptance  by the  Administrative  Agent of a properly
executed and delivered  Assignment and Assumption  Agreement pursuant to Section
13.04(b).  Coincident  with the delivery of such an  Assignment  and  Assumption
Agreement  to the  Administrative  Agent  for  acceptance  and  registration  of
assignment  or  transfer  of all or  part of a Loan,  or as soon  thereafter  as
practicable,  the  assigning or transferor  Lender shall  surrender the Note (if
any)  evidencing  such  Loan,  and  thereupon  one or more new Notes in the same
aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender
and/or the new Lender at the request of any such Lender.  The Borrower agrees to
indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses,  claims,

                                     -112-

<PAGE>



damages and  liabilities of whatsoever  nature which may be imposed on, asserted
against or incurred by the  Administrative  Agent in performing its duties under
this Section 13.15.

            13.16  CONFIDENTIALITY.  (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b)
of this  Section  13.16,  each  Lender  agrees  that it will use its  reasonable
efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrower (other than to
its employees, auditors, advisors or counsel or to another Lender if such Lender
or such Lender's  holding or parent  company in its sole  discretion  determines
that any such  party  should  have  access to such  information,  provided  such
Persons  shall be subject to the  provisions  of this Section  13.16 to the same
extent as such  Lender) any  information  with respect to the Borrower or any of
its  Subsidiaries  which  is now or in the  future  furnished  pursuant  to this
Agreement or any other Credit  Document,  provided  that any Lender may disclose
any such information (i) as has become  generally  available to the public other
than by virtue of a breach of this Section  13.16(a) by the  respective  Lender,
(ii) as may be required or  appropriate  in any report,  statement  or testimony
submitted to any municipal,  state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming
to have  jurisdiction  over such Lender or to the Federal  Reserve  Board or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar  organizations  (whether in the
United  States or elsewhere)  or their  successors,  (iii) as may be required or
appropriate  in respect to any  summons or subpoena  or in  connection  with any
litigation,  (iv) in order to comply with any law,  order,  regulation or ruling
applicable to such Lender,  (v) to the  Administrative  Agent or the  Collateral
Agent,  (vi) to any direct or  indirect  contractual  counterparty  in any swap,
hedge  or  similar   agreement  (or  to  any  such  contractual   counterparty's
professional  advisor),  so long  as  such  contractual  counterparty  (or  such
professional  advisor)  agrees  to be bound by the  provisions  of this  Section
13.16,  and (vii) to any  prospective  or actual  transferee or  participant  in
connection with any  contemplated  transfer or participation of any of the Notes
or  Commitments  or any  interest  therein by such  Lender,  provided  that such
prospective  transferee  agrees  to be bound by the  confidentiality  provisions
contained in this Section 13.16.

            (b) The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Lender may
share  with any of its  affiliates,  and such  affiliates  may  share  with such
Lender,  any  information  related to the  Borrower  or any of its  Subsidiaries
(including,  without limitation,  any non-public customer information  regarding
the  creditworthiness  of the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries),  provided  such
Persons  shall be subject to the  provisions  of this Section  13.16 to the same
extent as such Lender.

            (c) The Borrower  hereby  represents and  acknowledges  that, to the
best of its  knowledge,  neither any Agent nor any Lender,  nor any employees or
agents of, or other  persons  affiliated  with,  any Agent or any  Lender,  have
directly or indirectly  made or provided any statement  (oral or written) to the
Borrower or to any of its employees or agents, or other persons  affiliated with
or related to the Borrower  (or, so far as the  Borrower is aware,  to any other
person), as to the potential tax consequences of the Transaction.

            (d) Neither the Agents nor the Lenders  provide  accounting,  tax or
legal advice.  Notwithstanding  any express or implied  claims of exclusivity or
proprietary  rights,  the Borrower,  each Agent and each Lender hereby agree and
acknowledge  that the  Borrower,  each Agent and each  Lender (and each of their
employees,  representatives  or other agents) are  authorized to disclose to any
and all persons,  beginning  immediately upon  commencement of their discussions
and without  limitation of any kind,  the tax treatment and tax structure of the

                                     -113-

<PAGE>



Transaction,  and all  materials  of any kind  (including  opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to the Borrower, any Agent or any Lender relating to
such tax treatment and tax structure.  In this regard, the Borrower,  each Agent
and each Lender  acknowledge  and agree that the disclosure of the tax treatment
and tax structure of the  Transaction is not limited in any way by an express or
implied  understanding  or  agreement,  oral or  written  (whether  or not  such
understanding   or  agreement  is  legally   binding).   For  purposes  of  this
authorization,  "tax" means United States  Federal  income tax, "tax  treatment"
means the purported or claimed Federal income tax treatment of the  transaction,
and "tax  structure"  means any fact that may be relevant to  understanding  the
purported  or claimed  Federal  income tax  treatment of the  transaction.  This
paragraph is intended to reflect the  understanding of the Borrower,  each Agent
and each Lender that the Transaction is not a "confidential transaction" as that
phrase  is used in  Treasury  Regulation  ss.  1.6011-4(b)(3)(i),  and  shall be
interpreted  in a manner  consistent  therewith.  Nothing  herein is intended to
imply that any of the  Borrower,  each Agent and each  Lender made or provided a
statement,  oral or written,  to, or for the benefit of, any of each other as to
any  potential  tax  consequences  that are related to, or may result from,  the
Transaction.

            13.17 POST CLOSING ACTIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this  Agreement or the other Credit  Documents,  the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that:

            1. REAL  PROPERTY.  To the extent not  completed  on or prior to the
Initial  Borrowing Date, the actions relating to the Mortgages and Real Property
of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  pursuant to Section 5.12 (and the related
opinion pursuant to Section 5.03) shall be completed no later than 45 days after
the Initial Borrowing Date.

            2. UCC FILINGS;  FILINGS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; ETC.
(i) The Borrower and its Subsidiaries  were not required to have filed (or cause
to have filed) on or prior to the Initial  Borrowing Date  Financing  Statements
(Form UCC-1) or any filings with the United States  Patent and Trademark  Office
or the United States Copyright Office necessary to perfect the security interest
purported  to be created by the Security  Agreement.  Not later than the 5th day
after the Initial  Borrowing Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries  shall have
filed (or cause to have filed) all of such Financing Statements (Form UCC-1) and
any filings with the United  States  Patent and  Trademark  Office or the United
States Copyright Office necessary to perfect the security interest  purported to
be created by the Security Agreement.

All  provisions  of  this  Credit  Agreement  and  the  other  Credit  Documents
(including,  without  limitation,  all  conditions  precedent,  representations,
warranties,  covenants,  events of  default  and  other  agreements  herein  and
therein)  shall be  deemed  modified  to the  extent  necessary  to  effect  the
foregoing  (and to permit the taking of the actions  described  above within the
time periods  required  above,  rather than as otherwise  provided in the Credit
Documents);  provided  that (x) to the extent any  representation  and  warranty
would not be true  because the  foregoing  actions were not taken on the Initial
Borrowing Date the respective  representation  and warranty shall be required to
be true and correct in all material  respects at the time the respective  action
is taken  (or was  required  to be  taken)  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing
provisions  of this Section  13.16 and (y) all  representations  and  warranties
relating to the  Security  Documents  shall be  required to be true  immediately
after the actions required to be taken by this Section 13.16 have been taken (or
were required to be taken).  The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event
shall constitute a covenant and agreement by the Borrower to each of the Lenders

                                     -114-

<PAGE>



that the actions required  pursuant to this Section 13.17 will be, or have been,
taken within the relevant  time  periods  referred to in this Section  13.17 and
that, at such time, all representations and warranties  contained in this Credit
Agreement and the other Credit  Documents shall then be true and correct without
any modification  pursuant to this Section 13.17. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the failure to take any of the actions required above, within the
relevant time periods  required above,  shall give rise to an immediate Event of
Default pursuant to this Agreement.

            SECTION  14.  SPECIAL   PROVISIONS  WITH  RESPECT  TO  B  TERM  LOAN
OBLIGATIONS.

            14.01   Subordination  of  B  Term  Loan   Obligations;   Bankruptcy
Provisions.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this  Agreement or any
other Credit Document,  the Credit Parties,  the Lenders,  the Collateral Agent,
the  Administrative  Agent  and the  other  Senior  Creditors  hereby  agree and
acknowledge as follows:

            (a) The claims of the B Term Loan Lenders with respect to the B Term
      Loan  Obligations  shall be junior and  subordinate in right of payment to
      the claims of the Senior Creditors with respect to the Senior  Obligations
      to the extent,  and in the manner,  provided in this Section 14. Until the
      Senior Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the B Term
      Loan  Obligations  shall not be paid,  and no  payment  or  prepayment  on
      account  thereof  shall be made or given by any Credit  Party or received,
      accepted  or  retained  by the B Term  Loan  Lenders;  provided,  however,
      --------  -------  that so long as the Senior Loan  Maturity  Date has not
      occurred,  the Obligations  have not been  accelerated,  and no Default or
      Event of Default  under Section  10.05  exists,  (i)  regularly  scheduled
      payments of interest may be made with respect to the B Term Loans,  (ii) B
      Term Loan  Obligations may be paid in connection with the repayment of the
      Obligations of a non-consenting Lender pursuant to, and in accordance with
      the  requirements of, Sections 3.02(b) and 4.01(b) and (iii) amendment and
      consent  fees may be paid to B Term Loan  Lenders in  connection  with the
      requirements of Section 13.12(a).  Should any payment be received by any B
      Term Loan  Lender as  prohibited  herein,  such B Term Loan  Lender  shall
      forthwith  deliver the same to the  Administrative  Agent in precisely the
      form  received  (but  with the  endorsement  (although  without  recourse,
      representation or warranty) of such B Term Loan Lender where necessary for
      the collection thereof by the Administrative Agent) for application to the
      Senior  Obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section  13.06(d)
      of this Agreement,  and such B Term Loan Lender each agree that,  until so
      delivered,  the same shall be deemed  received by the B Term Loan  Lenders
      for the benefit of the Senior  Creditors and such payment shall be held in
      trust by such B Term Loan Lender for such purpose.

            (b) The Liens on any of the Collateral securing the Obligations that
      are granted to the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor pursuant
      to any Credit  Document or under  applicable  law shall  (subject  only to
      Permitted  Liens) be (i) first  priority Liens for the purpose of securing
      the Senior Obligations and (ii) prior to the indefeasible  payment in full
      in cash of the Senior  Obligations,  second priority Liens for the purpose
      of  securing  the B Term Loan  Obligations  (and,  after the  indefeasible
      payment in full in cash of the Senior  Obligations,  first  priority Liens
      for the purpose of securing the B Term Loan  Obligations).  In  perfecting
      such Liens,  the Collateral  Agent may file financing  statements (or make
      other  filings or take other  action)  noting its capacity as  "collateral

                                     -115-

<PAGE>



      agent" without making reference to the differing  interests of the various
      Secured  Creditors  and without  regard to the relative  priorities of the
      Liens securing the Senior  Obligations  and those securing the B Term Loan
      Obligations;   provided,  however,  that  the  Collateral  Agent  is  also
      authorized,  if it so  elects,  to  indicate  at any time  such  differing
      interests and relative  priorities in  connection  with the  perfection of
      such Liens.

            (c)  In  any  receivership,  insolvency  or  bankruptcy  proceeding,
      assignment  for the benefit of  creditors  or any other  proceeding  by or
      against any Credit Party for any relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency
      law  or  laws  relating  to  the  relief  of  debtors,   readjustment   of
      indebtedness,  reorganizations,  compositions or extensions  (collectively
      "INSOLVENCY  PROCEEDINGS")  which may be brought by or against  any Credit
      Party, the Administrative  Agent,  acting at the direction of the Required
      Senior  Lenders (and  without the consent of, and despite any  disapproval
      of, any other  Lender or any other  category of  Lenders),  shall have the
      sole power and authority (with respect to all of the  Obligations) to: (i)
      request  relief from the  automatic  stay to pursue  remedies  against the
      Collateral;  (ii) consent or object to any use of cash  collateral;  (iii)
      consent or object to any request for approval of  post-petition  financing
      and the imposition of Liens with respect to such  post-petition  financing
      (including  Liens  which may be given  priority  over those  securing  the
      Obligations); (iv) consent or object to the sale of any of the Collateral,
      including,  without  limitation,  to  sales  free and  clear of the  Liens
      securing the Obligations (so long as such sale is approved, and determined
      to be reasonable,  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  and any proceeds
      from  such  sale  that  are  approved  by the  court  for  payment  of any
      Obligations are applied to repay the Obligations in the order specified in
      Section  13.06(d));   (v)  request  adequate  protection  of  the  Secured
      Creditors' respective interests in the Obligations;  (vi) request, support
      or oppose the  appointment  of a trustee;  and (vii)  request,  support or
      oppose the conversion of a bankruptcy case from one chapter of the federal
      Bankruptcy Code to another.  With respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) of the
      preceding  sentence,  each of the  holders of the B Term Loan  Obligations
      agrees that (i) notice  received two Business  Days' prior to the entry of
      an order  approving such usage of cash  collateral and five Business Days'
      prior to the entry of an order  approving such financing shall be adequate
      notice;  and (ii)  provided it receives a Lien in any property  arising or
      acquired  after  the   commencement  of  such  proceeding   which  may  be
      substituted for the Collateral  subject to such usage under Section 363 or
      which  secures  such  financing  under  Section  364 (which  Lien shall be
      subordinated  to any  Lien in  such  property  held by the  Administrative
      Agent, the Collateral Agent, or the Lenders,  as the case may be, on terms
      substantially the same as the terms set forth in this Section 14), it will
      raise no  objection  to such usage or  financing  on the grounds  that its
      junior Lien  position  with respect to any  Collateral  is not  adequately
      protected. Without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, none
      of the Secured Creditors shall file or join in (with respect to all of the
      Obligations)  any  involuntary  petition  in  any  Insolvency  Proceedings
      against any Credit  Party.  In the event that any Secured  Creditor  shall
      fail  to  file a  proof  of  claim  with  respect  to the  portion  of the
      Obligations owed to such Secured Creditor prior to the date that is thirty
      (30)  days  before  the  deadline  for  filing  proofs  of  claim  in such
      Insolvency   Proceedings,   the  Secured   Creditors  hereby   irrevocably
      authorize, empower and appoint the Administrative Agent as their agent and
      attorney-in-fact to execute, verify, deliver and file such proofs of claim
      (but the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to file such proofs
      of claim and may elect to do so, or to refrain  from doing so, in its sole

                                     -116-

<PAGE>



      discretion).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Secured Creditors
      shall retain the right to independently  vote its respective  interests in
      the Obligations in any approval or rejection of any plan of reorganization
      in any  Insolvency  Proceedings  of any Credit Party.  The  Administrative
      Agent may file a copy of this Agreement with any court,  tribunal or other
      decision-making body to evidence the authority of the Administrative Agent
      to act on behalf of the Secured Creditors as specified in this Agreement.

            (d) In the  event  of any  distribution,  division  or  application,
      partial or  complete,  voluntary  or  involuntary,  by operation of law or
      otherwise,  of all or any part of the  assets of any  Credit  Party or the
      proceeds  thereof,  in whatever form, to creditors of any Credit Party, or
      upon any  indebtedness of any Credit Party, by reason of the  liquidation,
      dissolution or other winding up of any Credit Party or its business, or by
      reason of any sale or Insolvency  Proceeding,  then and in any such event,
      any  payment or  distribution  of any kind or  character,  either in cash,
      securities or other property,  which shall be payable or deliverable  upon
      or  with  respect  to any or all  of the  Obligations  (including  without
      limitation  any such  payment  or  distribution  which may be  payable  or
      deliverable  by  virtue  of the  provisions  of any  securities  which are
      subordinate  and  junior in right of  payment  of any of the  Obligations)
      shall  be paid or  delivered  directly  to the  Administrative  Agent  for
      application to the payment of the  Obligations  in the order  specified in
      Section 13.06(d).  All of the Obligations shall be entitled to accrue, and
      the Secured Creditors shall be entitled to recover, post-petition interest
      in any  Insolvency  Proceedings  regarding  any  Credit  Party;  provided,
      however,  that insofar as the relative rights of the Senior  Creditors and
      the B Term Loan Lenders inter se are concerned, the Senior Creditors shall
      be  entitled  to  receive  post-petition  interest  accrued  on all Senior
      Obligations prior to the receipt by the B Term Loan Lenders of any payment
      or property with respect to the B Term Loan Obligations.

            (e)  The  provisions  of  this  Agreement   regarding  the  relative
      priorities  of  the  claims  of,  and  Liens  securing,   the  Obligations
      constitute   a  continuing   agreement,   and  this   Agreement   and  the
      subordination of the B Term Loan  Obligations  (the "DEBT  SUBORDINATION")
      and the Liens with respect thereto (the "LIEN SUBORDINATION") provided for
      herein  shall  remain in full force and effect  regardless  of whether the
      Senior Obligations are from time to time reduced and thereafter  increased
      or entirely  extinguished and thereafter reincurred or incurred anew. This
      Agreement,  the Debt Subordination and the Lien Subordination shall remain
      in full force and effect and shall be irrevocable  until the  indefeasible
      payment in full in cash of all Senior Obligations.  To the extent that the
      Administrative  Agent or any other Senior Creditor receives any payment on
      account of any of the Senior Obligations, and any such payment or any part
      thereof  is  subsequently  invalidated,   declared  to  be  fraudulent  or
      preferential,  set  aside,  subordinated  or  required  to be  repaid to a
      trustee, receiver or any other person or entity (except as a result of the
      Administrative  Agent's or a Senior  Lender's gross  negligence or willful
      misconduct)  (whether in  connection  with any  Insolvency  Proceeding  or
      otherwise)  then,  to the  extent of such  payment  received,  the  Senior
      Obligations  or part  thereof  intended  to be  satisfied  and any and all
      subordination  obligations  and  agreements  of  the B Term  Loan  Lenders
      hereunder with respect to the B Term Loan Obligations  created or existing
      in favor of the  Administrative  Agent or the other Senior Creditors shall

                                     -117-

<PAGE>



      be revived and  continue in full force and effect,  as if such payment had
      not been received by the Administrative  Agent or the Senior Creditors and
      applied  on account of the Senior  Obligations.  No notice  purporting  to
      terminate this Agreement, the Debt Subordination or the Lien Subordination
      which  is  received  by  the  Administrative  Agent  or the  other  Senior
      Creditors  at any time when  this  Agreement  is still in effect  shall be
      effective,  in any manner or at any time  whatsoever,  to  terminate  this
      Agreement, the Debt Subordination or the Lien Subordination.  The relative
      priorities  of the Liens  securing the Senior  Obligations  and the B Term
      Loan  Obligations  shall  not be  altered  or  otherwise  affected  by any
      amendment, modification,  supplement, extension, renewal or restatement of
      the Senior  Obligations or the B Term Loan Obligations,  nor by any action
      which the Administrative Agent or any of the Secured Creditors may take or
      fail to take in respect of the  Collateral.  Each Secured  Creditor agrees
      that it will not contest (or support any other Person in  contesting)  the
      validity,  perfection,  priority  (as  established  by  Section  14.01) or
      enforceability  of any Lien  created  by the  Credit  Documents  (or under
      applicable law) securing any of the Obligations or the priority,  validity
      or enforceability of the Obligations (it being understood,  however,  that
      the Secured Creditors shall be entitled to assert the relative  priorities
      as between the Senior Obligations and the B Term Loan Obligations, created
      pursuant to this  Section 14 and the relevant  provisions  of the Security
      Documents.

            (f)   This   Agreement,   the  Debt   Subordination   and  the  Lien
      Subordination shall continue to be effective regardless of the solvency or
      insolvency of any Credit Party or any B Term Loan Lender;  the liquidation
      or  dissolution  of  any  Credit  Party  or any B Term  Loan  Lender;  the
      institution  by or against  any Credit  Party or any B Term Loan Lender of
      any Insolvency Proceeding, or any change in the ownership,  composition or
      nature of any Credit Party or any B Term Loan Lender.

            (g) Nothing in this Section 14.01 shall impair the rights granted to
      the  Required  Senior  Lenders  under  Section  14.02  to  deal  with  the
      Collateral,  which rights the parties  hereby agree shall continue in full
      force and effect (i)  notwithstanding  any  insolvency of any Credit Party
      and (ii) during and after any Insolvency  Proceedings regarding any Credit
      Party.

            (h) Should any Triggering Event occur, the Administrative Agent will
      endeavor to promptly give each Lender a Triggering  Event Notice,  but the
      failure to timely give any  Triggering  Event  Notice shall not affect the
      validity of any Triggering Event (including, without limitation, rendering
      any Lien  Enforcement  Action  invalid) or result in any  liability of the
      Administrative  Agent to the  Lenders,  the  Credit  Parties  or any other
      Person.  At any time within fifteen (15) Business Days after a B Term Loan
      Lender  shall be deemed  to have  received  any  Triggering  Event  Notice
      (pursuant to the notice  provisions  of Section  13.03),  such B Term Loan
      Lender shall have the option to give written notice (a "PURCHASE  NOTICE")
      to the Administrative  Agent (which notice the Administrative  Agent shall
      forward  to the  Senior  Lenders)  that  such B Term Loan  Lender  (either
      individually,  or with other B Term Loan  Lenders)  will purchase all (but
      not  less  than  all) of the  Senior  Loan  Obligations  from  the  Senior
      Creditors  (each B Term Loan  Lender  delivering  a  Purchase  Notice is a
      "PURCHASING   LENDER").   Any  Purchase  Notice,   once  given,  shall  be
      irrevocable. If there is more than one Purchasing Lender, then (unless all

                                     -118-

<PAGE>

      such Purchasing Lenders agree to the contrary in a joint written direction
      delivered  to the  Administrative  Agent) such  Purchasing  Lenders  shall
      purchase  the Senior  Loan  Obligations  pro rata based on their  relative
      holdings of the outstanding principal of the B Term Loans determined as of
      the date that the first Purchase Notice was received by the Administrative
      Agent.  The date (the  "Purchase  Date") on which the  Purchasing  Lenders
      shall purchase the Senior Loan  Obligations  shall be twenty (20) Business
      Days after the date the  Administrative  Agent  receives  the first of any
      such  Purchase  Notices (and the  Administrative  Agent shall  confirm the
      Purchase Date by written notice to the  Purchasing  Lenders and all Senior
      Lenders). On the Purchase Date, the Purchasing Lenders shall remit by wire
      transfer  immediately  available funds to the Administrative  Agent at the
      Payment Office in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the full amount of all
      outstanding  principal,  accrued but unpaid interest and accrued by unpaid
      fees on the Senior Loans;  (ii) all expenses  (including  attorneys' fees)
      incurred by the Senior Lenders that have not been reimbursed by the Credit
      Parties;  and  (iii)  cash  collateral  in the  amount of 102% of the face
      amount of any issued and  outstanding  Letters  of Credit  (including  any
      Letters  of  Credit  provided  by third  parties  in  accordance  with the
      provisions of the Credit Documents). The portion of the funds delivered to
      the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant  to  clauses  (i)  and  (ii)  of  the
      immediately  preceding  sentence shall be promptly delivered to the Senior
      Lenders.  The portion of the funds delivered to the  Administrative  Agent
      pursuant to clause (iii) of the  immediately  preceding  sentence shall be
      held by the Administrative Agent until such time as either (a) any drawing
      is made under the Letter of Credit to which  such funds  relate,  in which
      case such funds shall be promptly  thereafter  delivered to the respective
      Issuing  Lender or (b) the  Letter of Credit to which  such  funds  relate
      expires by its terms or is surrendered  without  drawing to the respective
      Issuing  Lender,  in which case such funds  shall be  promptly  thereafter
      returned to the Purchasing Lenders according to their respective interests
      in the purchased Senior Loans). In addition,  the Purchasing Lenders shall
      (severally  in proportion  to their  respective  shares of the Senior Loan
      Obligations  purchased by them on the Purchase  Date),  upon demand by the
      Administrative  Agent at the request of any Senior Lender,  reimburse each
      Senior  Lender  for:  (i) any loss,  cost,  damage or  expense  (including
      reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  legal  expenses)  it may  have  incurred
      (whether  before  or after  the  Purchase  Date) by any  Senior  Lender in
      connection with the sale of the Senior Loan  Obligations to the Purchasing
      Lenders  (including without  limitation,  any claims made by third parties
      against  any Senior  Lender);  (ii) any costs or  expenses  related to any
      issued and  outstanding  Letters of Credit;  and (iii) any checks or other
      payments  provisionally  recited against the Senior Loan Obligations or as
      to which the  Senior  Lenders  have not yet  received  final  payment.  In
      connection with such purchase of the Senior Loans,  each Senior Lender and
      the  Purchasing  Lenders shall  execute and deliver to the  Administrative
      Agent such Assignment and Assumption  Agreements as may be required by the
      Administrative Agent (and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
      or in any other Credit  Document,  no consent of any Credit Party shall be
      required in connection therewith).  Notwithstanding the sale of the Senior
      Loans as contemplated by this Section 14.01(h),  all indemnities under any
      Credit Documents that,  pursuant to the terms thereof,  are to survive any
      termination of this  Agreement  shall continue to apply after the Purchase
      Date to the Senior  Lenders  whose  loans have been sold  pursuant  to the
      provisions hereof.

            14.02   Senior   Lenders   to   Control    Collateral    Matters.(a)
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  in any Credit  Document,  until the
Senior Loans have been  indefeasibly  repaid in full in cash, the Senior Lenders
shall have the exclusive right to administer,  perform and enforce (or elect not
to enforce) the terms of the Credit  Documents  with  respect to all  Collateral
(other than with respect to any release of Collateral, which instead is governed
by the provisions of the immediately  succeeding  sentence and Sections 14.01(c)
and 13.12) and to exercise  and  enforce (or not  enforce)  all  privileges  and
rights  thereunder with respect to the Collateral,  at their sole discretion (by
directing the Collateral  Agent to take or refrain from taking such actions by a
vote of the Required Senior Lenders);  provided, that, absent direction from the
Required  Senior  Lenders,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall be entitled to take or
refrain from taking action as the Collateral Agent may determine is appropriate.
In addition,  but not in limitation of the foregoing  provisions of this Section
14.02,  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Credit Document,  during
the continuance of any Event of Default,  the Required Senior Lenders shall have
the exclusive  authority to authorize the release of the Liens granted  pursuant
to the Credit  Documents on any or all of the Collateral in connection  with the
sale or other  disposition  thereof  (provided  that the proceeds of the sale of
such Collateral shall  nevertheless be required to be distributed to the Secured
Creditors in accordance with Section 13.06(d), and no such release of Liens with
respect to the Collateral  shall extend to or otherwise affect any rights of any
Secured  Creditor to receive the proceeds from any sale or other  disposition of
the  Collateral  except to the extent such  proceeds are applied to repayment of
the  Obligations  as provided in Section  13.06(d)) in connection  with: (i) any
judicial or non-judicial foreclosure or similar actions or proceedings regarding
any of the  Collateral;  (ii)  any  transfer  of  any of the  Collateral  to the
Collateral  Agent  in lieu of  foreclosure;  and  (iii)  any  sale of any of the
Collateral  including,  without  limitation,  any sale by (a) any of the  Credit
Parties  (whether  outside  of  bankruptcy  or as  debtor-in-possession),  (b) a
receiver  for any of the  Credit  Parties,  (c) a trustee  for any of the Credit
Parties or (d) the Administrative  Agent or the Collateral Agent pursuant to the
terms of the Credit Documents or applicable law, provided,  however, that (x) in
connection  with any sale of the  Collateral  made  during the  pendency  of any
Insolvency  Proceedings,  such  sale  must  be  approved  and  determined  to be
reasonable by a court of competent  jurisdiction  and (y) in connection with any
sale of the Collateral  made during a time when  Insolvency  Proceedings are not
pending,  such sale  must be  conducted  in a  commercially  reasonable  manner.
Nothing in any Credit  Document  shall be  construed  to  prohibit  any  Secured
Creditor from bidding at any private or judicial sale of any Collateral.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Credit Document,
during the  continuance  of any Event of Default,  the Required  Senior  Lenders
shall have the exclusive  authority to authorize  the release of any  Subsidiary
Guarantor from the  Subsidiaries  Guaranty in connection  with the sale or other
disposition of the equity  interests of such  Subsidiary  Guarantor,  so long as
such  sale or other  disposition  is made  (and  the  proceeds  of such  sale or
disposition  are  applied) in  accordance  with the  requirements  of the second
sentence of Section 14.02(a).

            14.03 WAIVER OF LIABILITY  FOR ACTIONS  TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO B TERM
LOAN OBLIGATIONS AND COLLATERAL.  Subject to clause (y) of the proviso appearing
in the  penultimate  sentence of Section  14.02(a),  neither the  Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Creditor shall have any liability to
the holder of any B Term Loan  Obligations (in its capacity as such), and each B
Term  Loan  Lender  (in its  capacity  as such),  on  behalf  of itself  and its
successors and assigns,  hereby waives to the extent permitted by applicable law
any claim,  right,  action or cause of action which it may now or hereafter have

                                     -120-

<PAGE>



against the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Collateral  Agent or any other Secured
Creditor (including,  without limitation, any and all claims, rights, actions or
causes of action  that any B Term Loan  Lender may  otherwise  have  against the
Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor under
Sections 9-207, 9-609, 9-610, 9-611, 9-615, 9-617 and 9-625 to 9-628, inclusive,
of the UCC) arising out of, any and all actions which the Administrative  Agent,
the  Collateral  Agent or any other Secured  Creditor,  in good faith,  takes or
omits to take with respect to the  Obligations,  any obligor with respect to the
Senior Obligations or any Collateral,  including,  without  limitation,  actions
with respect to: the creation,  perfection or continuation of Liens with respect
to any Collateral; any Lien Enforcement Action or disposition of any Collateral;
the release of any Collateral; the custody, valuation, protection, preservation,
use or depreciation of any Collateral;  the realizing upon or failure to realize
upon any Collateral;  or the collection of the  Obligations.  To the extent that
any of the foregoing  waivers is not  permitted by applicable  law, it is agreed
that the applicable standard by which any non-waivable rights,  duties or claims
are to be  measured  shall  be  that  none  of  the  Administrative  Agent,  the
Collateral  Agent or any other  Secured  Creditor  shall have any  liability  or
responsibility to any holder of any B Term Loan Obligations,  for any actions or
omissions by the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Collateral  Agent or such Secured
Creditor other than actions or omissions constituting gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the  respective  such Person as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision.

            14.04  FURTHER  ASSURANCES.  Each of the  holders of the B Term Loan
Obligations  agrees to take such further action and shall execute and deliver to
the  Administrative  Agent,  the Collateral  Agent and the Senior Creditors such
additional  documents and instruments (in recordable  form, if requested) as the
Administrative   Agent,  the  Collateral  Agent  or  the  Senior  Creditors  may
reasonably  request to effectuate the terms of, and the  priorities  established
by, this Section 14. Each Secured Creditor (by its acceptance of the benefits of
the Credit  Documents  of which it is a  beneficiary)  acknowledges,  agrees and
accepts the provisions of this Section 14.
