If for any reason other than the gross negligence or bad faith of the
Indemnified Party being the primary cause of the loss claim, damage, liability,
cost or expense, the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to the Indemnified
Party or insufficient to hold them harmless, the Indemnitee shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of any and all
such losses, claim, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Indemnitee on the one
hand and the Indemnified Party on the other, but also the relative fault of the
Indemnitee and the Indemnified Party and other equitable considerations which
may be relevant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall in any
event contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party, as a result of the loss, claim, damage, liability, cost
or expense (other than a loss, claim, damage, liability, cost or expenses, the
primary cause of which is the gross negligence or bad faith of the Indemnified
Party), any excess of such amount over the amount of the fees actually received

It shall be a condition precedent to the right of any Party to submit any matter
to arbitration pursuant to the provisions hereof that any Party intending to
refer any matter to arbitration shall have given not less than five business
days&#146; prior written notice of its intention to do so to the other Party together

business days the Party who gave such notice may proceed to refer the dispute to
arbitration as provided for herein. Except for matters of indemnity or in the
case of urgency to prevent material harm to a substantive right or asset, the
Parties agree that all questions or matters in dispute with respect to this

The Party desiring arbitration shall appoint one arbitrator, and shall notify
the other Party of such appointment, and the other Party shall, within five
business days after receiving such notice, appoint an arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so named, before proceeding to act, shall, within five business days
of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator, unanimously agree on the
appointment of a third arbitrator, to act with them and be chairperson of the
arbitration herein provided for. If the other Party shall fail to appoint an
arbitrator within five business days after receiving notice of the appointment
of the first arbitrator, and if the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties
shall be unable to agree on the appointment of the chairperson, the chairperson
shall be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the British Columbia
<I>International Commercial Arbitration Act</I> (the &#147;<B>Arbitration Act</B>&#148;).
Except as specifically otherwise provided in this section, the arbitration
herein provided for shall be conducted in accordance with such Arbitration Act.
The chairperson, or in the case where only one arbitrator is appointed, the
single arbitrator, shall fix a time and place for the purpose of hearing the
evidence and representations of the Parties, and the chairperson shall preside
over the arbitration and determine all questions of procedure not provided for
by the Arbitration Act or this section. After hearing any evidence and
representations that the Parties may submit, the single arbitrator, or the
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall make an award and reduce the same to
writing, and deliver one copy thereof to each of the Parties. The expense of the
arbitration shall be paid as specified in the award. </P>
