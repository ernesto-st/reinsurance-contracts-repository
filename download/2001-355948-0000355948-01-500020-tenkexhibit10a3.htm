<P><B>EXCESS INSURANCE POLICY</B></P>
<P>In consideration of the payment of the premium and in reliance on all statements
  made and information furnished to Continental Casualty Company (hereinafter
  called the "Insurer"), and/or to the insurers of the Underlying Insurance, including
  the statements made in the Application made a part hereof and subject to all
  of the provisions of this Policy, the Insurer and the Insureds agree as follows:
</P>
<P>I. INSURING AGREEMENT</P>
<P> The Insurer shall provide the Insureds with excess coverage over the Underlying
  Insurance as set forth in Item 4 of the Declarations during the Policy Period
  set forth in Item 2 of the Declarations. Coverage hereunder shall attach only
  after all such Underlying Insurance has been exhausted by payments for losses
  and shall then apply in conformance with the same provisions of the Primary
  Policy at its inception, except for premium, limit of liability and as otherwise
  specifically set forth in the provisions of this Policy. </P>
<P>II. POLICY DEFINITIONS </P>
<P>Application shall mean the written application for this Policy, including any
  materials submitted therewith, which together shall be on file with the Insurer
  and deemed a part of and attached hereto as if physically attached to this Policy.
  Named Entity means the organization named in Item 1 of the Declarations. Insureds
  means those persons or organization(s) insured under the Primary Policy, at
  its inception. Policy Period means the period from the effective date and hour
  of this Policy as set forth in Item 2 of the Declarations, to the the Policy
  expiration date and hour set forth in Item 2 of the Declarations, or its earliest
  cancellation date, if any. Primary Policy means the Policy scheduled in Item
  4 (a) of the Declarations. Underlying Insurance means all those Policies scheduled
  in Item 4 of the Declarations and any Policies replacing them. </P>
<P>III. MAINTENANCE OF UNDERLYING INSURANCE </P>
<P>All of the Underlying Insurance scheduled in Item 4 of the Declarations shall
  be maintained during the Policy Period in full effect, except for any reduction
  of the aggregate limit(s) of liability available under the Underlying Insurance
  solely by reason of payment of losses thereunder. Failure to comply with the
  foregoing shall not invalidate this Policy but the Insurer shall not be liable
  to a greater extent than if this condition had been complied with. To the extent
  that any Underlying Insurance is not maintained in full effect during the currency
  of this Policy Period, then the Insureds shall be deemed to have retained any
  loss for the amount of the limit of liability of any Underlying Insurance which
  is not maintained as set forth above. In the event of any actual or alleged
  (a) failure by the Insureds to give Underlying Insurance or (b) misrepresentation
  or breach of warranties by any of the Insureds with respect to any Underlying
  Insurance, the Insurer shall not be liable hereunder to a greater extent than
  it would have been in the absence of such actual or alleged failure, misrepresentation
  or breach. It is further a condition of this Policy that the Insurer shall be
  notified in writing and/or alteration of any provisions of any of the policies
  of Underlying Insurance. </P>
<P>IV. LIMIT OF LIABILITY </P>
<P>The amount set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations shall be the maximum aggregate
  Limit of Liability of the Insurer for the Policy Period. </P>
<P>Costs of defense shall be part of and not in addition to the Limit of Liability
  in Item 3 of the Declarations, land such costs of defense shall reduce the Limit
  Liability stated in Item 3 of the Declarations. </P>
<P>V. DEPLETION OF UNDERLYING LIMIT(S) </P>
<P>In the event of the depletion of the limit(s) of liability of the Underlying
  Insurance solely as the result of actual payment of losses thereunder by the
  applicable insurers, this Policy shall, subject to the Insurer's Limit of Liability
  and to the other terms of this Policy, continue to apply to losses as Excess
  Insurance over the amount of insurance remaining under such Underlying Insurance.
  In the event of the exhaustion of all of the limit(s) of liability of such Underlying
  Insurance solely as a result of payment of losses thereunder, the remaining
  limits available under this Policy shall, subject to the Insurer's Limit of
  Liability and to the other provisions of this Policy, continue for subsequent
  losses as primary insurance and any retention specified in the Primary Policy
  shall be imposed under this Policy as to each claim made; otherwise no retention
  shall be imposed under this Policy. </P>
<P>This Policy only provides coverage excess of the Underlying Insurance. This
  Policy does not provide coverage for any loss not covered by the Underlying
  Insurance except and to the extent that such loss is not paid under the Underlying
  Insurance solely by reason of the reduction or exhaustion of the available Underlying
  Insurance through payments of loss thereunder. In the event the insurer of one
  or more of the Underlying Insurance policies fails to pay loss in connection
  with any claim covered under the Underlying Insurance as a result of insolvency,
  bankruptcy, or as liquidation of said insurer, then the Insureds hereunder shall
  be deemed to have retained any loss for the amount of limit of liability of
  said insurer which is not paid as a result of such insolvency, bankruptcy or
  liquidation. </P>
<P>If any Underlying Insurance bears an effective date which is prior to the effective
  date of this Policy and if any such insurance becomes exhausted or impaired
  by payment of loss with respect to any claim which, shall be deemed to be made
  prior to the effective date of this Policy, then with respect to any claim made
  after the effective date of this policy the Insureds shall be deemed to have
  retained any loss for the amount of exhausted or impaired by payment of loss
  with respect to such claim made prior to the effective date of this Policy.
</P>
<P>VI. CLAIM PARTICIPATION </P>
<P>The Insured shall not admit liability, consent to any judgment against them,
  or agree to any settlement which is reasonable likely to involve the Limit of
  Liability of this Policy without the Insurer's consent, such consent not to
  be unreasonably withheld. </P>
<P>The Insurer may, at its sole discretion, elect to participate in the investigation,
  settlement or defense of any claim against any of the Insureds for matters covered
  by this Policy even if the Underlying Insurance has not been exhausted. </P>
<P>All provisions of the Underlying Insurance are considered as part of this Policy
  except that it shall be the duty of the Insureds and not the duty of the Insurer
  to defend any claims against any of the Insureds. </P>
<P>VII. SUBROGATION - RECOVERIES </P>
<P>In that this Policy is "Excess Coverage", the Insureds and the Insurer's right
  of recovery against any person or other entity may not be exclusively subrogated.
  Despite the foregoing, in the event of any payment under this Policy, the Insurer
  shall be subrogated to all the Insured's rights of recovery against any person
  or organization, and the Insured's shall execute and deliver instruments and
  papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. </P>
<P>Any amounts recovered after payment of loss hereunder shall be apportioned
  in the inverse order of payment to the extent of actual payment. The expenses
  of all such recovery proceedings shall be apportioned in the ratio of respective
  recoveries. </P>
<P>VIII. NOTICE </P>
<P>The Insurer shall be given notice in writing as soon as is practicable in the
  event of (a) the cancellation of any Underlying and (b) any additional or return
  premiums charged or allowed in connection any Underlying Insurance. Notice regarding
  (a) and (b) above shall be given to Manager, Directors and Officers Liability
  Underwriting, CNA Insurance Companies, CNA Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60685. </P>

  Liability Claims, CNA Insurance Companies, CNA Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60685.

  agrees to act on behalf of all the insureds with respect to the giving and receiving
  of notice of claim or cancellations, the payment of premiums and the receiving
  of any return premiums that may become due under this Policy; and the Insureds
  agree that the Named Entity shall in all cases be authorized to act on their
  behalf. </P>

  made by endorsement signed by an employee of the Insurer or any of its agents
  relating to this Policy. </P>

  if the Policy is canceled in its entirety by the Named Entity. Under any other
  circumstances the refund shall be computed pro-rata. </P>
