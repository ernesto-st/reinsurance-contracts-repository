Capitalized terms used in this Agreement (including the attached Glossary of Terms) that are not defined in this Agreement or in the attached Glossary of Terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan. In the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the terms and provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement (including the attached Glossary of Terms), the Plan shall govern and control. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

number assumes 100% achievement of the Performance Goals). Each Award constitutes an unfunded and unsecured promise by Allied World to deliver (or cause to be delivered) to you a certain number of Shares and/or cash on the settlement date, subject
to the terms of this Agreement. Until such delivery of Shares, except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;3, you have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor, and no rights as a shareholder of Allied World. <B>THIS AWARD IS SUBJECT TO ALL

Period Percentage shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes under this Agreement and the Plan. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, which shall be subject to Section&nbsp;6(g) of the Plan, or as
provided in Sections 3(c), 3(d) and 3(e), the delivery of Shares and/or cash with respect to this Award is contingent on the attainment of the Performance Goals such that the Performance Period Percentage is greater than zero. Furthermore, pursuant
to Section&nbsp;4 and except as otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion or provided in Section&nbsp;3(c) or 3(d), in order to be entitled to payment with respect to this Award, you must be employed by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries on the Determination Date. </FONT></P>
