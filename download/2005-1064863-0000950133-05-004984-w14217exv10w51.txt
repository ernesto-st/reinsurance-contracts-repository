     2.6  Assignment and Subcontracting

          a)   The Contractor shall not, without SDOH's prior written consent,
               assign, transfer, convey, sublet, or otherwise dispose of this
               Agreement; of the Contractor's right, title, interest,
               obligations, or duties under the Agreement; of the Contractor's
               power to execute the Agreement; or, by power of attorney or
               otherwise, of any of the Contractor's rights to receive monies
               due or to become due under this Agreement. SDOH agrees that it
               will not unreasonably withhold consent of the Contractor's
               assignment of this Agreement, in whole or in part, to a parent,
               affiliate or subsidiary corporation, or to a transferee of all or
               substantially all of its assets. Any assignment, transfer,
               conveyance, sublease, or other disposition without SDOH's consent
               shall be void.

          b)   Contractor may not enter into any subcontracts related to the
               delivery of services to Enrollees, except by a written agreement,
               as set forth in Section 22 of this Agreement. The Contractor may
               subcontract for provider services and management services. If
               such written agreement would be between Contractor and a provider
               of health care or ancillary health services or between Contractor
               and an independent practice association, the agreement must be in
               a form previously approved by SDOH. If such subcontract is for
               management services under 10 NYCRR Part 98, it must be approved
               by SDOH prior to its becoming effective. Any subcontract entered
               into by Contractor shall fulfill the requirements of 42 CFR Parts
               434 and 438 to the extent such regulations are or become
               effective that are appropriate to the service or activity
               delegated under such subcontract. Contractor agrees that it shall
               remain legally responsible to SDOH for carrying out all
               activities under this Agreement and that no subcontract shall
               limit or terminate Contractor's responsibility.

     2.7  Termination

          a)   SDOH Initiated Termination

               i)   SDOH shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, in

                    product; or for either or both products in specified
                    counties of Contractor's service area, if the Contractor:

                    A)   takes any action that threatens the health, safety, or

                         not cured within twenty (20) days, or to such longer
                         period as the parties may agree, of SDOH's written

                    G)   knowingly has a director, officer, partner or person
                         owning or controlling more than five percent (5%) of
                         the Contractor's equity, or has an employment,
                         consulting, or other agreement with such a person for
                         the provision of items and/or services that are
                         significant to the Contractor's contractual obligation
                         who has been debarred or suspended by the federal,
                         state or local government, or otherwise excluded from
                         participating in procurement activities.

               ii)  The SDOH will notify the Contractor of its intent to
                    terminate this Agreement for the Contractor's failure to
                    meet the requirements of this Agreement and provide
                    Contractor with a hearing prior to the termination.

               iii) If SDOH suspends, limits or revokes Contractor's Certificate
                    of Authority under PHL Section 4404, and:

                    A)   if such action results in the Contractor ceasing to
                         have authority to serve the entire contracted service
                         area, as defined by Appendix M of this Agreement, this
                         Agreement shall terminate on the date the Contractor
                         ceases to have such authority; or

                    B)   if such action results in the Contractor retaining
                         authority to serve some portion of the contracted
                         service area, the Contractor shall continue to offer
                         its MMC and/or FHPlus products under this Agreement in
                         any designated geographic areas not affected by such
                         action, and shall terminate its MMC and/or FHPlus

               The Contractor and the SDOH each shall have the right to
               terminate this Agreement in its entirety, for either the

               in the event that SDOH and the Contractor fail to reach agreement
               on the monthly Capitation Rates. In such event, the party
               exercising its right shall give the other party written notice
               specifying the reason for and the effective date of termination,
               which shall not be less time than will permit an orderly

               i)   The Contractor shall have the right to terminate this
                    Agreement in its entirety, for either the Contractor's MMC
                    or FHPlus product, or for either or both products in
                    specified counties of the Contractor's service area, in the
                    event that SDOH materially breaches the Agreement or fails
                    to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement that
                    is not cured within twenty (20) days, or within such longer
                    period as the parties may agree, of the Contractor's written
                    request for compliance. The Contractor shall give SDOH
                    written notice specifying the reason for and the effective
                    date of the termination, which shall not be less time than

                    event that its obligations are materially changed by
                    modifications to this Agreement and its Appendices by SDOH.
                    In such event, Contractor shall give SDOH written notice
                    within thirty (30) days of notification of changes to the
                    Agreement or Appendices specifying the reason and the
                    effective date of termination, which shall not be less time
                    than will permit an orderly transition of Enrollees, but no
                    more than ninety (90) days.

               iii) The Contractor shall have the right to terminate this
                    Agreement in its entirety, for either the Contractor's MMC
                    or FHPlus product, or for either or both products in
                    specified counties of the Contractor's service area, if the
                    Contractor is unable to provide services pursuant to this
                    Agreement because of a natural disaster and/or an act of God
                    to such a degree that Enrollees cannot obtain reasonable
                    access to services within the Contractor's organization,
                    and, after diligent efforts, the Contractor cannot make
                    other provisions for the delivery of such services. The
                    Contractor shall give SDOH written notice of any such
                    termination that specifies:

                         reasonable access to services;

                    B)   the Contractor's attempts to make other provision for
                         the delivery of services; and

                    C)   the effective date of the termination, which shall not
                         be less time than will permit an orderly transition of
                         Enrollees, but no more than ninety (90) days.

          d)   Termination Due To Loss of Funding

               In the event that State and/or Federal funding used to pay for
               services under this Agreement is reduced so that payments cannot
               be made in full, this Agreement shall automatically terminate,
               unless both parties agree to a modification of the obligations
               under this Agreement. The effective date of such termination
               shall be ninety (90) days after the Contractor receives written
               notice of the reduction in payment, unless available funds are
               insufficient to continue payments in full during the ninety (90)
               day period, in which case SDOH shall give the Contractor written
               notice of the earlier date upon which the Agreement shall
               terminate. A reduction in State and/or Federal funding cannot
               reduce monies due and owing to the Contractor on or before the
               effective date of the termination of the Agreement.

     2.8  Close-Out Procedures

          a)   Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement in its entirety,
               for either the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product, or for either
               or both products in specified counties of the Contractor's
               service area, and in the event that it is not scheduled for
               renewal, the Contractor shall comply with close-out procedures
               that the Contractor develops in conjunction with LDSS and that
               the LDSS, and the SDOH have approved. The close-out procedures

                    subsequent to the effective date of termination;

               ii)  The Contractor shall give SDOH, and other authorized

                    such books, records, or documents that may be required by
                    such agencies pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

               iii) If this Agreement is terminated in its entirety, the
                    Contractor shall submit to SDOH, and authorized federal,
                    state or local agencies, within ninety (90) days of
                    termination, a final financial statement, made by a
                    certified public accountant or a licensed public accountant,
                    unless the Contractor

                    required, for an extension of time for this submission;

               iv)  The Contractor shall establish an appropriate plan
                    acceptable to and prior approved by the SDOH for the orderly
                    transition of Enrollees. This plan shall include the
                    provision of pertinent information to identified Enrollees
                    who are: pregnant; currently receiving treatment for a
                    chronic or life threatening condition; prior approved for
                    services or surgery; or whose care is being monitored by a

               v)   SDOH shall promptly pay all claims and amounts owed to the
                    Contractor.

          b)   Any termination of this Agreement by either the Contractor or
               SDOH shall be done by amendment to this Agreement, unless the
               Agreement is terminated by the SDOH due to conditions in Section
               2.7 (a)(i) or Appendix A of this Agreement.

     2.11 Severability

          If this Agreement contains any unlawful provision that is not an
          essential part of this Agreement and that was not a controlling or
          material inducement to enter into this Agreement, the provision shall
          have no effect and, upon notice by either party, shall be deemed
          stricken from this Agreement without affecting the binding force of
          the remainder of this Agreement.

3.   COMPENSATION

     3.1  Capitation Payments

          a)   Compensation to the Contractor shall consist of a monthly
               capitation payment for each Enrollee and the Supplemental
               Capitation Payments as described in Section 3.1 (d), where
               applicable.

          b)   The monthly Capitation Rates are attached hereto as Appendix L,
               which is hereby made a part of this Agreement as if set forth
               fully herein.

          c)   The monthly capitation payments, and the Supplemental Newborn
               Capitation Payment and the Supplemental Maternity Capitation
               Payment, when applicable, to the Contractor shall constitute full
               and complete payments to the Contractor for all services that the
               Contractor provides, except for payments due the Contractor as
               set forth in Sections 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 of this Agreement for
               MMC Enrollees.

          d)   Capitation Rates shall be effective for the entire contract
               period, except as described in Section 3.2.

     3.2  Modification of Rates During Contract Period

          Modification to Capitation Rates during the term of this Agreement
          shall be subject to approval by the New York State Division of the
          Budget (DOB) and shall be incorporated into this Agreement by written
          amendment mutually agreed upon by the SDOH and the Contractor, as
          specified in Section 2.2 of this Agreement.

     3.3  Rate Setting Methodology

          a)   Capitation rates shall be determined prospectively and shall not
               be retroactively adjusted to reflect actual Medicaid
               fee-for-service data or Contractor experience for the time period
               covered by the rates. Capitated rates in effect as of April 1,
               2006 and thereafter, shall be certified to be actuarially sound
               in accordance with 42 CFR Section 438.6(c).

          b)   Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Section 3.3(a) above,
               the SDOH reserves the right to terminate this Agreement, in its
               entirety for either the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product, or
               for either or both products in specified counties of the
               Contractor's service area, pursuant to Section 2.7 of this
               Agreement, upon determination by SDOH that the aggregate monthly
               Capitation Rates are not cost effective.

     3.4  Payment of Capitation

          a)   The monthly capitation payments for each Enrollee are due to the
               Contractor from the Effective Date of Enrollment until the
               Effective Date of Disenrollment of the Enrollee or termination of
               this Agreement, whichever occurs first. The Contractor shall
               receive a full month's capitation payment for the month in which
               Disenrollment occurs. The Roster generated by SDOH with any
               modification communicated electronically or in writing by the
               LDSS or the Enrollment Broker prior to the end of the month in
               which the Roster is generated, shall be the Enrollment list for
               purposes of eMedNY premium billing and payment, as discussed in
               Section 6.9 and Appendix H of this Agreement.

          b)   Upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a properly completed claim
               for monthly capitation payments submitted by the Contractor
               pursuant to this Agreement, the Fiscal Agent will promptly
               process such claim for payment and use its best efforts to
               complete such processing within thirty (30) business days from
               date of receipt of the claim by the Fiscal Agent. Processing of
               Contractor claims shall be in compliance with the requirements of
               42 CFR Section 447.45. The Fiscal Agent will also use its best
               efforts to resolve any billing problem relating to the
               Contractor's claims as soon as possible. In accordance with
               Section 41 of the New York State Finance Law (SFL), the State and
               LDSS shall have no liability under this Agreement to the
               Contractor or anyone else beyond funds appropriated and available
               for this Agreement.

     3.5  Denial of Capitation Payments

          If the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) denies
          payment for new Enrollees, as authorized by SSA Section 1903(m)(5) and
          42 CFR Section 438.730 (e), or such other applicable federal statutes
          or regulations, based upon a determination that Contractor failed
          substantially to provide medically necessary items and services,
          imposed premium amounts or charges in excess of permitted payments,
          engaged in discriminatory practices as described in SSA Section
          1932(e)(1)(A)(iii), misrepresented or falsified information submitted
          to CMS, SDOH, LDSS, the Enrollment Broker, or an Enrollee, Prospective
          Enrollee, or health care provider, or failed to comply with federal
          requirements (i.e. 42 CFR Section 422.208 and 42 CFR Section 438.6 (h)
          relating to the Physician Incentive Plans), SDOH and LDSS will deny
          capitation payments to the Contractor for the same Enrollees for the
          period of time for which CMS denies such payment.

     3.6  SDOH Right to Recover Premiums

          The parties acknowledge and accept that the SDOH has a right to
          recover premiums paid to the Contractor for MMC Enrollees listed on
          the monthly Roster who are later determined for the entire applicable
          payment month, to have been in


                                    SECTION 3
                                 (COMPENSATION)

<PAGE>

          an institution; to have been incarcerated; to have moved out of the
          Contractor's service area subject to any time remaining in the MMC
          Enrollee's Guaranteed Eligibility period; or to have died. SDOH has a
          right to recover premiums for FHPlus Enrollees listed on the Roster
          who are determined to have been incarcerated; to have moved out of the
          Contractor's service area or their county of fiscal responsibility; or
          to have died. In any event, the State may only recover premiums paid
          for MMC and/or FHPlus Enrollees listed on a Roster if it is determined
          by the SDOH that the Contractor was not at risk for provision of
          Benefit Package services for any portion of the payment period.

     3.7  Third Party Health Insurance Determination

          The Contractor will make diligent efforts to determine whether
          Enrollees have third party health insurance (TPHI). The LDSS is also
          responsible for making diligent efforts to determine if Enrollees have
          TPHI and to maintain third party information on the WMS/eMedNY Third
          Party Resource System. The Contractor shall make good faith efforts to
          coordinate benefits with and collect TPHI recoveries from other
          insurers, and must inform the LDSS of any known changes in status of
          TPHI insurance eligibility within thirty (30) days of learning of a
          change in TPHI. The Contractor may use the Roster as one method to
          determine TPHI information. The Contractor will be permitted to retain
          one hundred percent (100%) of any reimbursement for Benefit Package
          services obtained from TPHI. Capitation Rates are net of TPHI
          recoveries. In no instances may an Enrollee be held responsible for
          disputes over these recoveries.

     3.8  Payment For Newborns

          a)   The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and services
               included in the Benefit Package associated with an Enrollee's
               newborn, unless the child is Excluded from Medicaid Managed Care
               pursuant to Appendix H of this Agreement, or the Contractor does
               not offer a MMC product in the mother's county of fiscal
               responsibility.

          b)   The Contractor shall receive a capitation payment from the first
               day of the newborn's month of birth and, in instances where the
               Contractor pays the hospital or birthing center for the newborn
               stay, a Supplemental Newborn Capitation Payment.

          c)   Capitation Rate and Supplemental Newborn Capitation Payment for a
               newborn will begin the month following certification of the
               newborn's eligibility and enrollment, retroactive to the first
               day of the month in which the child was born.

          d)   The Contractor cannot bill for a Supplemental Newborn Capitation
               Payment unless the newborn hospital or birthing center payment
               has been paid by the Contractor. The Contractor must maintain on
               file evidence of payment to the


                                    SECTION 3
                                 (COMPENSATION)

               hospital or birthing center of the claim for the newborn stay.
               Failure to have supporting records may, upon an audit, result in
               recoupment of the Supplemental Newborn Capitation Payment by
               SDOH.

     3.9  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment

          a)   The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and services
               included in the Benefit Package associated with the maternity
               care of an Enrollee.

          b)   In instances where the Enrollee is enrolled in the Contractor's
               MMC or FHPlus product on the date of the delivery of a child, the
               Contractor shall be entitled to receive a Supplemental Maternity
               Capitation Payment. The Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment
               reimburses the Contractor for the inpatient and outpatient costs
               of services normally provided as part of maternity care,
               including antepartum care, delivery and post-partum care. The
               Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment is in addition to the
               monthly Capitation Rate paid by the SDOH to the Contractor for
               the Enrollee.

          c)   In instances where the Enrollee was enrolled in the Contractor's
               MMC or FHPlus product for only part of the pregnancy, but was
               enrolled on the date of the delivery of the child, the Contractor
               shall be entitled to receive the entire Supplemental Maternity
               Capitation Payment. The Supplemental Capitation payment shall not
               be pro-rated to reflect that the Enrollee was not enrolled in the
               Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product for the entire duration of the
               pregnancy.

          d)   In instances where the Enrollee was enrolled in the Contractor's
               MMC or FHPlus product for part of the pregnancy, but was not
               enrolled on the date of the delivery of the child, the Contractor
               shall not be entitled to receive the Supplemental Maternity
               Capitation Payment, or any portion thereof.

          e)   Costs of inpatient and outpatient care associated with maternity
               cases that end in termination or miscarriage shall be reimbursed
               to the Contractor through the monthly Capitation Rate for the
               Enrollee and the Contractor shall not receive the Supplemental
               Maternity Capitation Payment.

          f)   The Contractor may not bill a Supplemental Maternity Capitation
               Payment until the hospital inpatient or birthing center delivery
               is paid by the Contractor, and the Contractor must maintain on
               file evidence of payment of the delivery, plus any other
               inpatient and outpatient services for the maternity care of the
               Enrollee to be eligible to receive a Supplemental Maternity
               Capitation Payment. Failure to have supporting records may, upon
               audit, result in recoupment of the Supplemental Maternity
               Capitation Payment by the SDOH.

     3.10 Contractor Financial Liability

          Contractor shall not be financially liable for any services rendered
          to an Enrollee prior to his or her Effective Date of Enrollment.

     3.11 Inpatient Hospital Stop-Loss Insurance for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC)
          Enrollees

          a)   The Contractor must obtain stop-loss coverage for inpatient
               hospital services for MMC Enrollees. A Contractor may elect to

               based on the lower of the Contractor's negotiated hospital rate
               or Medicaid rates of payment.

               [ ]  The Contractor has elected to have NYS provide stop-loss
                    reinsurance for MMC Enrollees.

               ii)  Enrollees with a complaint of Nonconsensual Enrollment may
                    request an expedited Disenrollment by the LDSS.

               iii) In districts where homeless individuals are Exempt, as

               iv)  Retroactive Disenrollments may be warranted in rare
                    instances and may be requested of the LDSS as described in
                    Appendix H of this Agreement.

               v)   Substantiation of non-routine Disenrollment requests by the
                    LDSS will result in Disenrollment in accordance with the
                    timeframes as set forth in Appendix H of this Agreement.

     8.4  Contractor Notification of Disenrollments

          a)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Roster,
               along with any changes sent by the LDSS to the Contractor in
               writing or electronically, shall serve as official notice to the
               Contractor of Disenrollment of an Enrollee. In cases of expedited
               and retroactive Disenrollment, the Contractor shall be notified
               of the Enrollee's Effective Date of Disenrollment by the LDSS.

          b)   In the event that the LDSS intends to retroactively disenroll an
               Enrollee on a date prior to the first day of the month of the
               Disenrollment request, the LDSS is responsible for consulting
               with the Contractor prior to Disenrollment. Such consultation
               shall not be required for the retroactive Disenrollment of
               Supplemental Security Income (SSI) infants where it is clear that
               the Contractor was not a risk for the provision of Benefit
               Package services for any portion of the retroactive period.

          c)   In all cases of retroactive Disenrollment, including
               Disenrollments effective the first day of the current month, the
               LDSS is responsible for noticing the Contractor at the time of
               Disenrollment of the Contractor's responsibility to submit to the
               SDOH's Fiscal Agent voided premium claims for any months of
               retroactive Disenrollment where the Contractor was not at risk
               for the provision of Benefit Package services during the month.

     8.5  Contractor's Liability

          a)   The Contractor is not responsible for providing the Benefit
               Package under this Agreement on or after the Effective Date of
               Disenrollment except as hereinafter provided:

               i)   The Contractor shall be liable for any part of the cost of a
                    hospital stay for a MMC Enrollee who is admitted to the
                    hospital prior to the Effective Date of Disenrollment from
                    the Contractor's MMC product and who remains hospitalized on
                    the Effective Date of Disenrollment; except when the MMC
                    Enrollee, on or after the Effective Date of Disenrollment,
                    1) is transferred from one hospital to another; or 2) is
                    discharged from one unit in the hospital to another unit in
                    the same facility and under Medicaid fee-for-service payment
                    rules, the method of payment changes from: a) DRG case-based
                    rate of payment per discharge to a per diem rate of payment


                                    SECTION 8
                                 (DISENROLLMENT)

                    exempt from DRG case-based payment rates, or b) from a per
                    diem payment rate exempt from DRG case-based payment rates
                    to either another per diem rate, or a DRG case-based payment
                    rate. In such instances, the Contractor shall not be liable
                    for the cost of the consecutive stay. For the purposes of
                    this paragraph, "hospital stay" does not include a stay in a
                    hospital that is a) certified by Medicare as a long-term
                    care hospital and b) has an average length of stay for all
                    patients greater than ninety-five (95) days as reported in
                    the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System
                    (SPARCS) Annual Report 2002; in such instances, Contractor
                    liability will cease on the Effective Date of Disenrollment.

               ii)  The Contractor shall be liable for any part of the cost of a
                    hospital stay for a FHPlus Enrollee who is admitted to the
                    hospital prior to the Effective Date of Disenrollment from
                    the Contractor's FHPlus product and who has not been
                    discharged as of the Effective Date of Disenrollment, up to
                    the date the FHPlus Enrollee is discharged.

          b)   The Contractor shall notify the LDSS that the Enrollee remains in
               the hospital and provide the LDSS with information regarding his
               or her medical status. The Contractor is required to cooperate
               with the Enrollee and the new MCO (if applicable) on a timely
               basis to ensure a smooth transition and continuity of care.

     8.6  Enrollee Initiated Disenrollment

          a)   An Enrollee subject to Lock-In as described in Section 7 of this
               Agreement may initiate Disenrollment from the Contractor's MMC or
               FHPlus product for Good Cause as defined in Appendix H of this
               Agreement at any time during the Lock-In period by filing an oral
               or written request with the LDSS.

          b)   Once the Lock-In Period has expired, the Enrollee may disenroll
               from the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product at any time, for any
               reason.

     8.7  Contractor Initiated Disenrollment

          a)   The Contractor may initiate an involuntary Disenrollment if an
               Enrollee engages in conduct or behavior that seriously impairs
               the Contractor's ability to furnish services to either the
               Enrollee or other Enrollees, provided that the Contractor has
               made and documented reasonable efforts to resolve the problems
               presented by the Enrollee.

          b)   Consistent with 42 CFR Section 438.56 (b), the Contractor may not
               request Disenrollment because of an adverse change in the
               Enrollee's health status, or because of the Enrollee's
               utilization of medical services, diminished mental capacity, or
               uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from the
               Enrollee's special needs (except where continued Enrollment in
               the Contractor's MMC

               or FHPlus product seriously impairs the Contractor's ability to
               furnish services to either the Enrollee or other Enrollees).

          c)   Contractor initiated Disenrollments must be carried out in
               accordance with the requirements and timeframes described in
               Appendix H of this Agreement.

          d)   Once an Enrollee has been disenrolled at the Contractor's
               request, he/she will not be re-enrolled with the Contractor's MMC
               or FHPlus product unless the Contractor first agrees to such
               re-enrollment.

     8.8  LDSS Initiated Disenrollment

          a)   The LDSS is responsible for promptly initiating Disenrollment
               when:

               i)   an Enrollee is no longer eligible for MMC or FHPlus; or

               ii)  the Guaranteed Eligibility period ends and an Enrollee is no
                    longer eligible for MMC or FHPlus benefits; or

               iii) an Enrollee is no longer the financial responsibility of the
                    LDSS; or

               iv)  an Enrollee becomes ineligible for Enrollment pursuant to
                    Section 6.1 of this Agreement; or

               v)   an Enrollee has moved outside the service area covered by
                    this Agreement, unless Contractor can demonstrate that:

                    A)   the Enrollee has made an informed choice to continue
                         Enrollment with the Contractor and that Enrollee will
                         have sufficient access to the Contractor's provider
                         network; and

                    B)   fiscal responsibility for Medicaid or FHPlus coverage
                         remains in the county of origin.

9.   GUARANTEED ELIGIBILITY

     9.1  General Requirements

          SDOH and the Contractor will follow the policies in this section
          subject to state and federal law and regulation.

     9.2  Right to Guaranteed Eligibility

          a)   New Enrollees, other than those identified in Section 9.2(b)
               below, who would otherwise lose Medicaid or FHPlus eligibility
               during the first six (6) months of Enrollment will retain the
               right to remain enrolled in the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus
               product, as applicable, under this Agreement for a period of six
               (6) months from their Effective Date of Enrollment.

          b)   Guaranteed Eligibility is not available to the following
               Enrollees:

               i)   Enrollees who lose eligibility due to death, moving out of
                    State, or incarceration;

               ii)  Female MMC Enrollees with a net available income in excess
                    of medically necessary income but at or below two hundred
                    percent (200%) of the federal poverty level who are only
                    eligible for Medicaid while they are pregnant and then
                    through the end of the month in which the sixtieth (60th)
                    day following the end of the pregnancy occurs.

          c)   If, during the first six (6) months of Enrollment in the
               Contractor's MMC product, an MMC Enrollee becomes eligible for
               Medicaid only as a spend-down, the MMC Enrollee will be eligible
               to remain enrolled in the Contractor's MMC product for the
               remainder of the six (6) month Guaranteed Eligibility period.
               During the six (6) month Guaranteed Eligibility period, an MMC
               Enrollee eligible for spend-down and in need of wrap-around
               services has the option of spending down to gain full Medicaid
               eligibility for the wrap-around services. In this situation, the
               LDSS is responsible for monitoring the MMC Enrollee's need for
               wrap-around services and manually setting coverage codes as
               appropriate.

          d)   FHPlus Enrollees who become eligible for Medicaid benefits
               without an income or resource spend-down will not be entitled to
               a Guaranteed Eligibility period.

          e)   Enrollees who lose and regain Medicaid or FHPlus eligibility
               within a three (3) month period will not be entitled to a new
               period of six (6) months Guaranteed Eligibility.

               iii) The care or service will assist the Enrollee to achieve or
                    maintain maximum functional capacity in performing daily
                    activities, taking into account both the functional capacity

          b)   The Contractor shall base its determination on medical and other

               furnished by the Contractor in accordance with standards of care.

          c)   The Contractor agrees that anonymous testing may be furnished to
               the Enrollee without prior approval by the Contractor and may be

               obtained from the Contractor during the period the Enrollee is
               enrolled in the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product.

          d)   To adequately address the HIV prevention needs of uninfected
               Enrollees, as well as the special needs of Enrollees with HIV
               infection, the Contractor shall have in place all of the
               following:

               i)   Methods for promoting HIV prevention to all Enrollees. HIV
                    prevention information, both primary as well as secondary,
                    should be tailored to the Enrollee's age, sex, and risk
                    factor(s) (e.g., injection drug use and sexual risk
                    activities), and should be culturally and linguistically
                    appropriate. HIV primary prevention means the reduction or
                    control of causative factors for HIV, including the
                    reduction of risk factors. HIV Primary prevention includes
                    strategies to help prevent uninfected Enrollees from
                    acquiring HIV, i.e., behavior counseling for HIV negative
                    Enrollees with risk behavior. Primary prevention also
                    includes strategies to help prevent infected Enrollees from
                    transmitting HIV infection, i.e., behavior counseling with
                    an HIV infected Enrollee to reduce risky sexual behavior or
                    providing antiviral therapy to a pregnant, HIV infected
                    female to prevent transmission of HIV infection to a
                    newborn. HIV Secondary Prevention means promotion of early
                    detection and treatment of HIV disease in an asymptomatic
                    Enrollee to prevent the development of symptomatic disease.
                    This includes: regular medical assessments; routine
                    immunization for preventable infections; prophylaxis for
                    opportunistic infections; regular dental, optical,
                    dermatological and gynecological care; optimal
                    diet/nutritional supplementation; and partner notification
                    services which lead to the early detection and treatment of
                    other infected persons. All Enrollees should be informed of
                    the availability of HIV counseling, testing, referral and
                    partner notification (CTRPN) services.

               ii)  Policies and procedures promoting the early identification
                    of HIV infection in Enrollees. Such policies and procedures
                    shall include at a minimum: assessment methods for
                    recognizing the early signs and symptoms of HIV disease;
                    initial and routine screening for HIV risk factors through
                    administration of sexual behavior and drug and alcohol use
                    assessments; and the provision of information to all
                    Enrollees regarding the availability of HIV CTRPN services
                    from Participating Providers or as part of a Family Planning
                    and Reproductive Health services visit pursuant to Appendix
                    C of this Agreement, and the availability of anonymous CTRPN
                    services from New York State, New York City and the LPHA.

               iii) Policies and procedures that require Participating Providers
                    to provide HIV counseling and recommend HIV testing to
                    pregnant women in their care. The HIV counseling and testing
                    provided shall be done in accordance with Article 27-F of
                    the PHL. Such policies and procedures


                                   SECTION 10

                    shall also direct Participating Providers to refer any HIV
                    positive women in their care to clinically appropriate
                    services for both the women and their newborns.

               iv)  A network of providers sufficient to meet the needs of its
                    Enrollees with HIV. Satisfaction of the network requirement
                    may be accomplished by inclusion of HIV specialists within
                    the network or the provision of HIV specialist consultation
                    to non-HIV specialists serving as PCPs for persons with HIV
                    infection; inclusion of Designated AIDS Center Hospitals or
                    other hospitals experienced in HIV care in the Contractor's
                    network; and contracts or linkages with providers funded
                    under the Ryan White CARE Act. The Contractor shall inform
                    Participating Providers about how to obtain information
                    about the availability of Experienced HIV Providers and HIV
                    Specialist PCPs.

               v)   Case Management Assessment for Enrollees with HIV Infection.
                    The Contractor shall establish policies and procedures to
                    ensure that Enrollees who have been identified as having HIV
                    infection are assessed for case management services. The
                    Contractor shall arrange for any Enrollee identified as
                    having HIV infection and needing case management services to
                    be referred to an appropriate case management services
                    provider, including Contractor provided case management,
                    and/or, with appropriate consent of the Enrollee, HIV
                    community-based psychosocial case management services and/or
                    COBRA Comprehensive Medicaid Case Management (CMCM) services
                    for MMC Enrollees.

               vi)  The Contractor shall require its Participating Providers to
                    report positive HIV test results and diagnoses and known
                    contacts of such persons to the New York State Commissioner
                    of Health. In New York City, these shall be reported to the
                    New York City Commissioner of Health. Access to partner
                    notification services must be consistent with 10 NYCRR Part
                    63.

               vii)The Contractor's Medical Director shall review Contractor's
                    HIV practice guidelines at least annually and update them as
                    necessary for compliance with recommended SDOH AIDS
                    Institute and federal government clinical standards. The
                    Contractor will disseminate the HIV Practice Guidelines or
                    revised guidelines to Participating Providers at least
                    annually, or more frequently as appropriate.

     10.23 Persons Requiring Chemical Dependence Services

          a)   The Contractor will have in place all of the following for its

               vi)  The Contractor also agrees to participate in the local

                    Contractor's approved Marketing plan, and the SDOH, in
                    consultation with the LDSS, deems the infraction to be minor
                    or unintentional in nature, the SDOH and/or the LDSS may
                    issue a warning letter to the Contractor.

               ii)  If the Contractor engages in Marketing activities that SDOH
                    determines, in it sole discretion, to be an intentional or
                    serious breach of the Marketing Guidelines or the
                    Contractor's approved Marketing plan, or a pattern of minor
                    breaches, SDOH, in consultation with the LDSS, may require
                    the Contractor to, and the Contractor shall, prepare and
                    implement a corrective action plan acceptable to SDOH within
                    a specified timeframe. In addition, or alternatively, SDOH
                    may impose sanctions, including monetary penalties, as
                    permitted by law.

               iii) If the Contractor commits further infractions, fails to pay
                    monetary penalties within the specified timeframe, fails to
                    implement a corrective action plan in a timely manner or
                    commits an egregious first-time infraction, the SDOH, in
                    consultation with the LDSS, may in addition to any other
                    legal remedy available to SDOH in law or equity:

                    A)   direct the Contractor to suspend its Marketing
                         activities for a period up to the end of the Agreement
                         period;

               a toll-free telephone line. Personnel must also be available via
               a toll-free telephone line (which can be the member services

               iv)  Clarifying information in the member handbook for Enrollees.

               v)   Advising Enrollees of the Contractor's complaint and appeals

                    rights to a fair hearing or external review.

               vi)  Clarifying for MMC Enrollees current categories of
                    exemptions and exclusions. The Contractor may refer to the
                    LDSS or the Enrollment Broker, where one is in place, if
                    necessary, for more information on exemptions and

               language other than English as a primary language. Interpreter
               services must be offered in person where practical, but otherwise
               may be offered by telephone.

          a)   The Contractor shall maintain and update, on a quarterly basis, a
               listing by specialty of the names, addresses and telephone
               numbers of all Participating Providers, including facilities.
               Such a list/directory shall include names, office addresses,

          a)   The Contractor must issue an identification card to the Enrollee
               containing the following information:

               i)   the name of the Enrollee's clinic (if applicable);

               ii)  the name of the Enrollee's PCP and the PCP's telephone
                    number (if an Enrollee is being served by a PCP team, the
                    name of the individual shown on the card should be the lead
                    provider);

               iii) the member services toll free telephone number;

               iv)  the twenty-four (24) hour toll free telephone number that
                    Enrollees may use to access information on obtaining
                    services when his/her PCP is not available; and

               v)   for ID Cards issued after October 1, 2004, the Enrollee's
                    Client Identification Number (CIN).

          b)   PCP information may be embossed on the card or affixed to the
               card by a sticker.

          c)   The Contractor shall issue an identification card within fourteen
               (14) days of an Enrollee's Effective Date of Enrollment. If
               unforeseen circumstances, such as the lack of identification of a
               PCP, prevent the Contractor from forwarding the official
               identification card to new Enrollees within the fourteen (14) day
               period, alternative measures by which Enrollees may identify
               themselves such as use of a Welcome Letter or a temporary
               identification card shall be deemed acceptable until such time as
               a PCP is either chosen by the Enrollee or auto assigned by the
               Contractor. The Contractor agrees to implement an alternative
               method by which individuals may identify himself/herself as
               Enrollees prior to receiving the card (e.g., using a "welcome
               letter" from the Contractor) and to update PCP information on the
               identification card. Newborns of Enrollees need not present ID
               cards in order to receive Benefit Package services from the
               Contractor and its Participating Providers. The Contractor is not
               responsible for providing Benefit Package services to newborns
               Excluded from the MMC Program pursuant to Appendix H of this
               Agreement, or when the Contractor does not offer an MMC product
               in the mother's county of fiscal responsibility.

     13.4 Member Handbooks

          The Contractor shall issue to a new Enrollee within fourteen (14) days
          of the Effective Date of Enrollment a Member Handbook, which is
          consistent with the SDOH guidelines described in Appendix E, which is
          hereby made a part of this Agreement as if set forth fully herein.

     13.5 Notification of Effective Date of Enrollment

          The Contractor shall inform each Enrollee in writing within fourteen
          (14) days of the Effective Date of Enrollment of any restriction on
          the Enrollee's right to terminate enrollment. The initial enrollment
          information and the Member Handbook shall be adequate to convey this
          notice.

     13.6 Notification of Enrollee Rights

          a)   The Contractor agrees to make all reasonable efforts to contact
               new Enrollees, in person, by telephone, or by mail, within thirty
               (30) days of their Effective Date of Enrollment. "Reasonable
               efforts" are defined to mean at least three (3) attempts, with
               more than one method of contact being employed. Upon contacting
               the new Enrollee(s), the Contractor agrees to do at least the
               following:

               i)   Inform the Enrollee about the Contractor's policies with
                    respect to obtaining medical services, including services
                    for which the Enrollee may self-refer pursuant to Section
                    10.15 of this Agreement, and what to do in an emergency.

               ii)  Conduct a brief health screening to assess the Enrollee's
                    need for any special health care (e.g., prenatal or
                    behavioral health services) or language/communication needs.
                    If a special need is identified, the Contractor shall assist
                    the Enrollee in arranging for an appointment with his/her
                    PCP or other appropriate provider.

               iii) Offer assistance in arranging an initial visit to the
                    Enrollee's PCP for a baseline physical and other preventive
                    services, including an assessment of the Enrollee's
                    potential risk, if any, for specific diseases or conditions.

               iv)  Inform new Enrollees about their rights for continuation of
                    certain existing services.

               v)   Provide the Enrollee with the Contractor's toll free
                    telephone number that may be called twenty-four (24) hours a
                    day, seven (7) days a week if the Enrollee has questions
                    about obtaining services and cannot reach his/her PCP (this
                    telephone number need not be the Member Services line and
                    need not be staffed to respond to Member Services-related
                    inquiries). The Contractor must have appropriate mechanisms
                    in place to accommodate Enrollees who do not have telephones
                    and therefore cannot readily receive a call back.

               vi)  Advise Enrollee about opportunities available to learn about
                    the Contractor's policies and benefits in greater detail
                    (e.g., welcome meeting, Enrollee orientation and education
                    sessions).

               vii) Assist the Enrollee in selecting a primary care provider if
                    one has not already been chosen.

     13.7 Enrollee's Rights

          a)   The Contractor shall, in compliance with the requirements of 42
               CFR Section 438.6(i)(1) and 42 CFR Part 489 Subpart I, maintain
               written policies and procedures regarding advance directives and
               inform each Enrollee in writing at the time of enrollment of an
               individual's rights under State law to formulate advance
               directives and of the Contractor's policies regarding the
               implementation of such rights. The Contractor shall include in
               such written notice to the Enrollee materials relating to advance
               directives and health care proxies as specified in 10 NYCRR Part
               98 and Section 700.5. The written information must reflect
               changes in State law as soon as possible, but no later than
               ninety (90) days after the effective date of the change.

          b)   The Contractor shall have policies and procedures that protect
               the Enrollee's right to:

               i)   receive information about the Contractor and managed care;

               ii)  be treated with respect and due consideration for his or her
                    dignity and privacy;

               iii) receive information on available treatment options and
                    alternatives, presented in a manner appropriate to the
                    Enrollee's condition and ability to understand;

               iv)  participate in decisions regarding his or her health care,
                    including the right to refuse treatment;

               v)   be free from any form of restraint or seclusion used as a
                    means of coercion, discipline, convenience or retaliation,
                    as specified in Federal regulations on the use of restraints
                    and seclusion; and

               vi)  If the privacy rule, as set forth in 45 CFR Parts 160 and
                    164, Subparts A and E, applies, request and receive a copy
                    of his or her medical records and request that they be
                    amended or corrected, as specified in 45 CFR Sections
                    164.524 and 164.526.

               ii)  The transitional period shall continue up to ninety (90)

                         a treatment plan approved by the Contractor.

               iii) In no event shall this requirement be construed to require

               the PHL and 42 CFR Part 456. Enrollee's records must include
               information needed to perform utilization review as specified in
               42 CFR Sections 456.111 and 456.211. The Contractor's approved

               without the prior written approval of the SDOH.

          b)   The Contractor shall incorporate the findings from reports in
               Section 18 of this Agreement into its quality assurance program.
               Where performance is less than the statewide average or another
               standard as defined by the SDOH and developed in consultation
               with MCOs and appropriate clinical experts, the Contractor will
               be required to develop and implement a plan for improving
               performance that is approved by the SDOH and that specifies the
               expected level of improvement and timeframes for actions expected
               to result in such improvement. In the event that such approved
               plan proves to be impracticable or does not result in the
               expected level of improvement, the Contractor shall, in
               consultation with SDOH, develop alternative plans to achieve
               improvement, to be implemented upon SDOH approval. If requested
               by SDOH, the Contractor agrees to meet with the SDOH to review
               improvement plans and quality performance.

     16.2 Standards of Care

          a)   The Contractor must adopt practice guidelines consistent with

               adolescent, and pediatric care.

          b)   The Contractor must ensure that its decisions for utilization
               management, enrollee education, coverage of services, and other
               areas to which the practice guidelines apply are consistent with
               the guidelines.

               changes in practice guidelines to its Participating Providers at
               least annually, or more frequently, as appropriate.

          d)   The Contractor shall develop and implement protocols for
               identifying Participating Providers who do not adhere to practice
               guidelines and for making reasonable efforts to improve the
               performance of these providers.

          e)   Annually, the Contractor shall select a minimum of two practice
               guidelines and monitor the performance of appropriate
               Participating Providers (or a sample of providers) against such

                         immediately from a Contractor pursuant to investigating

                    accepting new patients, and the geographic location of the
                    providers and Enrollees.

               ii)  The Contractor's network must contain all of the provider
                    types necessary to furnish the prepaid Benefit Package,
                    including but not limited to: hospitals, physicians (primary
                    care and specialists), mental health and substance abuse
                    providers, allied health professionals, ancillary providers,
                    DME providers, home health providers, and pharmacies, if
                    applicable.

               iii) To be considered accessible, the network must contain a
                    sufficient number and array of providers to meet the diverse
                    needs of the Enrollee population. This includes being
                    geographically accessible (meeting time/distance standards)
                    and being accessible for the disabled.

          b)   The Contractor shall not include in its network any provider

               i)   who has been sanctioned or prohibited from participation in
                    Federal health care programs under either Section 1128 or
                    Section 1128A of the SSA; or

               ii)  who has had his/her licensed suspended by the New York State
                    Education Department or the SDOH Office of Professional
                    Medical Conduct.

          c)   The Contractor must require that Participating Providers offer
               hours of operation that are no less than the hours of operation
               offered to commercial members or, if the provider serves only MMC
               Enrollees and/or FHPlus Enrollees, comparable to hours offered
               for Medicaid fee-for-service patients.

          d)   The Contractor shall submit its network for SDOH to assess for
               adequacy through the HPN prior to execution of this Agreement,
               quarterly thereafter throughout the term of this Agreement, and
               upon request by SDOH when SDOH determines there has been a
               significant change that could affect adequate capacity and
               quarterly thereafter.

          e)   Contractor must limit participation to providers who agree that
               payment received from the Contractor for services included in the
               Benefit Package is

               payment in full for services provided to Enrollees, except for
               the collection of applicable co-payments from Enrollees as
               provided by law.

     21.2 Absence of Appropriate Network Provider

          In the event that the Contractor determines that it does not have a
          Participating Provider with appropriate training and experience to
          meet the particular health care needs of an Enrollee, the Contractor
          shall make a referral to an appropriate Non-Participating Provider,
          pursuant to a treatment plan approved by the Contractor in
          consultation with the Primary Care Provider, the Non-Participating
          Provider and the Enrollee or the Enrollee's designee. The Contractor
          shall pay for the cost of the services in the treatment plan provided
          by the Non-Participating Provider for as long as the Contractor is
          unable to provide the service through a Participating Provider.

     21.3 Suspension of Enrollee Assignments To Providers

          The Contractor shall ensure that there is sufficient capacity,
          consistent with SDOH standards, to serve Enrollees under this
          Agreement. In the event any of the Contractor's Participating
          Providers are no longer able to accept assignment of new Enrollees due
          to capacity limitations, as determined by the SDOH, the Contractor
          will suspend assignment of any additional Enrollees to such
          Participating Provider until such provider is capable of further
          accepting Enrollees. When a Participating Provider has more than one
          (1) site, the suspension will be made by site.

     21.4 Credentialing

          a)   Credentialing/Recredentialing Process

               The Contractor shall have in place a formal process, consistent
               with SDOH Recommended Guidelines for Credentialing Criteria, for
               credentialing Participating Providers on a periodic basis (not
               less than once every three (3) years) and for monitoring
               Participating Providers performance.

          b)   Licensure

               The Contractor shall ensure, in accordance with Article 44 of the
               PHL, that persons and entities providing care and services for
               the Contractor in the capacity of physician, dentist, physician
               assistant, registered nurse, other medical professional or
               paraprofessional, or other such person or entity satisfy all
               applicable licensing, certification, or qualification
               requirements under New York law and that the functions and
               responsibilities of such persons and entities in providing
               Benefit Package services under this Agreement do not exceed those
               permissible under New York law.

          c)   Minimum Standards

               i)   The Contractor agrees that all network physicians will meet
                    at least one (1) of the following standards, except as
                    specified in Section 21.15 (c) and Appendix I of this
                    Agreement:

                    A)   Be board-certified or board-eligible in their area of
                         specialty;

                    B)   Have completed an accredited residency program; or

                    C)   Have admitting privileges at one (1) or more hospitals
                         participating in the Contractor's network.

     21.5 SDOH Exclusion or Termination of Providers

          If SDOH excludes or terminates a provider from its Medicaid program,
          the Contractor shall, upon learning of such exclusion or termination,
          immediately terminate the Provider Agreement with the Participating
          Provider with respect to the Contractor's MMC and/or FHPlus product,
          and agrees to no longer utilize the services of the subject provider,
          as applicable. The Contractor shall access information pertaining to
          excluded Medicaid providers through the SDOH Health Provider Network.
          Such information available to the Contractor on the HPN shall be
          deemed to constitute constructive notice. The HPN should not be the
          sole basis for identifying current exclusions or termination of
          previously approved providers. Should the Contractor become aware,
          through the HPN or any other source, of an SDOH exclusion or
          termination, the Contractor shall validate this information with the
          Office of Medicaid Management, Bureau of Enforcement Activities and
          comply with the provisions of this Section.

     21.6 Application Procedure

          a)   The Contractor shall establish a written application procedure to
               be used by a health care professional interested in serving as a
               Participating Provider with the Contractor. The criteria for
               selecting providers, including the minimum qualification
               requirements that a health care professional must meet to be
               considered by the Contractor, must be defined in writing and
               developed in consultation with appropriately qualified health
               care professionals. Upon request, the application procedures and
               minimum qualification requirements must be made available to
               health care professionals.

          b)   The selection process may not discriminate against particular
               providers that serve high-risk populations or specialize in
               conditions that require costly treatment.

          c)   The Contractor may not discriminate with regard to the
               participation, reimbursement, or indemnification of any provider
               who is acting within the scope of his or her license or
               certification under applicable State law, solely on the basis of
               that license or certification. This does not preclude the
               Contractor from including providers only to the extent necessary
               to meet its


                                   SECTION 21

               needs; or from establishing different payment rates for different
               counties or different specialists; or from establishing measures
               designed to maintain the quality of services and control costs
               consistent with its responsibilities.

          d)   If the Contractor does not approve an individual or group of
               providers as Participating Providers, it must give the affected
               providers written notice of the reason for its decision.

     21.7 Evaluation Information

          The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to
          ensure that Participating Providers are regularly advised of
          information maintained by the Contractor to evaluate their performance
          or practice. The Contractor shall consult with health care
          professionals in developing methodologies to collect and analyze
          Participating Providers profiling data. The Contractor shall provide
          any such information and profiling data and analysis to its
          Participating Providers. Such information, data or analysis shall be
          provided on a periodic basis appropriate to the nature and amount of
          data and the volume and scope of services provided. Any profiling data
          used to evaluate the performance or practice of a Participating
          Provider shall be measured against stated criteria and an appropriate
          group of health care professionals using similar treatment modalities
          serving a comparable patient population. Upon presentation of such
          information or data, each Participating Provider shall be given the
          opportunity to discuss the unique nature of his or her patient
          population which may have a bearing on the Participating Provider's
          profile and to work cooperatively with the Contractor to improve
          performance.

     21.8 Choice/Assignment of Primary Care Providers (PCPs)

          a)   The Contractor shall offer each Enrollee the choice of no fewer
               than three (3) Primary Care Providers within distance/travel time
               standards as set forth in Section 15.5 of this Agreement.

          b)   Contractor must assign a PCP to Enrollees who fail to select a
               PCP. The assignment of a PCP by the Contractor may occur after
               written notification to the Contractor of the Enrollment (through
               Roster or other method) and after written notification of the
               Enrollee by the Contractor but in no event later than thirty (30)
               days after notification of Enrollment, and only after the
               Contractor has made reasonable efforts as set forth in Section
               13.6 of this Agreement to contact the Enrollee and inform him/her
               of his/her right to choose a PCP.

          c)   PCP assignments should be made taking into consideration the
               following:

               i)   Enrollee's geographic location;

               ii)  any special health care needs, if known by the Contractor;
                    and

               iii) any special language needs, if known by the Contractor.

<PAGE>

          d)   In circumstances where the Contractor operates or contracts with
               a multi-provider clinic to deliver primary care services, the
               Enrollee must choose or be assigned a specific provider or
               provider team within the clinic to serve as his/her PCP. This
               "lead" provider will be held accountable for performing the PCP
               duties.

     21.9 Enrollee PCP Changes

          a)   The Contractor must allow Enrollees the freedom to change PCPs,
               without cause, within thirty (30) days of the Enrollee's first
               appointment with the PCP. After the first thirty (30) days, the
               Contractor may elect to limit the Enrollee to changing PCPs every
               six (6) months without cause.

          b)   The Contractor must process a request to change PCPs and advise
               the Enrollee of the effective date of the change within
               forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request. The change must
               be effective no later than the first (1st) day of the second
               (2nd) month following the month in which the request is made.

          c)   The Contractor will provide Enrollees with an opportunity to
               select a new PCP in the event that the Enrollee's current PCP
               leaves the network or otherwise becomes unavailable. Such changes
               shall not be considered in the calculation of changes for cause
               allowed within a six (6) month period.

          d)   In the event that an assignment of a new PCP is necessary due to
               the unavailability of the Enrollee's former PCP, such assignment
               shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 21.8
               of this Agreement.

          e)   In addition to those conditions and circumstances under which the
               Contractor may assign an Enrollee a PCP when the Enrollee fails
               to make an affirmative choice of a PCP, the Contractor may
               initiate a PCP change for an Enrollee under the following
               circumstances:

               i)   The Enrollee requires specialized care for an acute or
                    chronic condition and the Enrollee and Contractor agree that
                    reassignment to a different PCP is in the Enrollee's
                    interest.

               ii)  The Enrollee's place of residence has changed such that
                    he/she has moved beyond the PCP travel time/distance
                    standard.

               iii) The Enrollee's PCP ceases to participate in the Contractor's
                    network.

               iv)  The Enrollee's behavior toward the PCP is disruptive and the
                    PCP has made all reasonable efforts to accommodate the
                    Enrollee.

               v)   The Enrollee has taken legal action against the PCP or the
                    PCP has taken legal action against the Enrollee.

          f)   Whenever initiating a change, the Contractor must offer affected
               Enrollees the opportunity to select a new PCP in the manner
               described in this Section.

     21.10 Provider Status Changes

          a)   PCP Changes

               i)   The Contractor agrees to notify its Enrollees of any of the
                    following PCP changes:

                    A)   Enrollees will be notified within fifteen (15) days
                         from the date on which the Contractor becomes aware
                         that such Enrollee's PCP has changed his or her office
                         address or telephone number.

                    B)   If a PCP ceases participation in the Contractor's
                         network, the Contractor shall provide written notice
                         within fifteen (15) days from the date that the
                         Contractor becomes aware of such change in status to
                         each Enrollee who has chosen the provider as his or her
                         PCP. In such cases, the notice shall describe the
                         procedures for choosing an alternative PCP and, in the
                         event that the Enrollee is in an ongoing course of
                         treatment, the procedures for continuing care
                         consistent with subdivision 6 (e) of PHL Section 4403.

                    C)   Where an Enrollee's PCP ceases participation with the
                         Contractor, the Contractor must ensure that the
                         Enrollee selects or is asigned to a new PCP is assigned
                         within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice to
                         the Enrollee.

          b)   Other Provider Changes

               In the event that an Enrollee is in an ongoing course of
               treatment with another Participating Provider who becomes
               unavailable to continue to provide services to such Enrollee, the
               Contractor shall provide written notice to the Enrollee within
               fifteen (15) days from the date on which the Contractor becomes
               aware of the Participating Provider's unavailability to the
               Enrollee. In such cases, the notice shall describe the procedures
               for continuing care consistent with PHL Section 4403 (6)(e) and
               for choosing an alternative Participating Provider.

     21.11 PCP Responsibilities

          In conformance with the Benefit Package, the PCP shall provide health
          counseling and advice; conduct baseline and periodic health
          examinations; diagnose and treat conditions not requiring the services
          of a specialist; arrange inpatient care, consultations with
          specialists, and laboratory and radiological services when medically
          necessary; coordinate the findings of consultants and laboratories;
          and interpret such findings to the Enrollee and the Enrollee's family,
          subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 20 of this
          Agreement, and

          maintain a current medical record for the Enrollee. The PCP shall also
          be responsible for determining the urgency of a consultation with a
          specialist and shall arrange for all consultation appointments within
          appropriate time frames.

     21.12 Member to Provider Ratios

          a)   The Contractor agrees to adhere to the member-to-PCP ratios shown
               below. These ratios are Contractor-specific, and assume the
               practitioner is a full time equivalent (FTE) (defined as a

               Participating Provider in accordance with the subcontract or
               Provider Agreement, the subcontractor or Participating Provider
               will not seek payment from the SDOH, LDSS, the Enrollees, or
               persons acting on an Enrollee's behalf.

          g)   The Contractor shall include in every Provider Agreement a
               procedure for the resolution of disputes between the Contractor
               and its Participating Providers.

          h)   The Contractor shall ensure that all Provider Agreements entered
               into with Providers require acceptance of a woman's Enrollment in
               the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product as sufficient to provide
               services to her newborn,

               not offer a MMC product in the mother's county of fiscal
               responsibility.

          i)   The Contractor must monitor the subcontractor's performance on an
               ongoing basis and subject it to formal review according to time
               frames established by the State, consistent with State laws and
               regulations, and the terms of this Agreement. When deficiencies

               iii) Advocating to the Contractor on behalf of the Enrollee for
                    approval or coverage of a particular treatment or for the
                    provision of health care services.

     22.8 Transfer of Liability

          No contract or agreement between the Contractor and a Participating
          Provider shall contain any clause purporting to transfer to the
          Participating Provider, other than a medical group, by indemnification
          or otherwise, any liability relating to

     22.9 Termination of Health Care Professional Agreements

          a)   General Requirements

               i)   The Contractor shall not terminate a contract with a health
                    care professional unless the Contractor provides to the
                    health care professional a written explanation of the
                    reasons for the proposed termination and an opportunity for
                    a review or hearing as hereinafter provided. For purposes of
                    this Section, a health care professional is an individual
                    licensed, registered or certified pursuant to Title VII of
                    the Education Law.

               ii)  These requirements shall not apply in cases involving
                    imminent harm to patient care, a determination of fraud, or
                    a final disciplinary action by a state licensing board or
                    other governmental agency that impairs the health care
                    professional's ability to practice.

          b)   Notice of Health Care Professional Termination

               i)   When the Contractor desires to terminate a contract with a
                    health care professional, the notification of the proposed
                    termination by the Contractor to the health care
                    professional shall include:

                    A)   the reasons for the proposed action;

                    B)   notice that the health care professional has the right
                         to request a hearing or review, at the provider's
                         discretion, before a panel appointed by the Contractor;

                    C)   a time limit of not less than thirty (30) days within
                         which a health care professional may request a hearing;
                         and

                    D)   a time limit for a hearing date which must be held
                         within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a
                         request for a hearing.

          c)   No contract or agreement between the Contractor and a health care
               professional shall contain any provision which shall supersede or
               impair a health care professional's right to notice of reasons
               for termination and the opportunity for a hearing or review
               concerning such termination.

     22.10 Health Care Professional Hearings

          a)   A health care professional that has been notified of his or her
               proposed termination must be allowed a hearing. The procedures
               for this hearing must meet the following standards:

               i)   The hearing panel shall be comprised of at least three
                    persons appointed by the Contractor. At least one person on
                    such panel shall be a clinical peer in the same discipline
                    and the same or similar specialty as the health care
                    professional under review. The hearing panel may consist of
                    more than three persons, provided however, that the number
                    of clinical peers on such panel shall constitute one-third
                    or more of the total membership of the panel.

               ii)  The hearing panel shall render a decision on the proposed
                    action in a timely manner. Such decision shall include
                    reinstatement of the health care professional by the
                    Contractor, provisional reinstatement subject to conditions
                    set forth by the Contractor or termination of the health
                    care professional. Such decision shall be provided in
                    writing to the health care professional.

               iii) A decision by the hearing panel to terminate a health care
                    professional shall be effective not less than thirty (30)
                    days after the receipt by the health care professional of
                    the hearing panel's decision. Notwithstanding the
                    termination of a health care professional for cause or
                    pursuant to a hearing, the Contractor shall permit an
                    Enrollee to continue an on-going course of treatment for a
                    transition period of up to ninety (90) days, and post-partum
                    care, subject to the provider's agreement, pursuant to PHL
                    Section 4403(6)(e).

               iv)  In no event shall termination be effective earlier than
                    sixty (60) days from the receipt of the notice of
                    termination.

     22.11 Non-Renewal of Provider Agreements

          Either party to a Provider Agreement may exercise a right of
          non-renewal at the expiration of the Provider Agreement period set
          forth therein or, for a Provider Agreement without a specific
          expiration date, on each January first occurring after the Provider
          Agreement has been in effect for at least one year, upon sixty (60)
          days notice to the other party; provided, however, that any
          non-renewal shall not constitute a termination for the purposes of
          this Section.


                                   SECTION 22
                     (SUBCONTRACTS AND PROVIDER AGREEMENTS)

     22.12 Notice of Participating Provider Termination

          a)   The Contractor shall notify SDOH of any notice of termination or
               non-renewal of an IPA or institutional network Provider
               Agreement, or medical group Provider Agreement that serves five
               percent or more of the enrolled population in a LDSS and/or when
               the termination or non-renewal of the medical group provider will
               leave fewer than two Participating Providers of that type within
               the LDSS, unless immediate termination of the Provider Agreement
               is justified. The notice shall include an impact analysis of the
               termination or non-renewal with regard to Enrollee access to
               care.

          b)   The Contractor shall provide the notification required in (a)
               above to the SDOH ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of
               the termination of the Provider Agreement or immediately upon
               notice from such Participating Provider if less than ninety (90)
               days.

          c)   The Contractor shall provide the notification required in (a)
               above to the SDOH if the Contractor and the Participating
               Providers have failed to execute a renewal Provider Agreement
               forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of the current
               Provider Agreement.

          d)   In addition to the notification required in (a) above, the
               Contractor shall submit a contingency plan to SDOH, at least
               forty-five (45) days prior to the termination or expiration of
               the Provider Agreement, identifying the number of Enrollees
               affected by the potential withdrawal of the provider from the
               Contractor's network and specifying how services previously
               furnished by the Participating Provider will be provided in the
               event of its withdrawal from the Contractor's network. If the
               Participating Provider is a hospital, the Contractor shall
               identify the number of doctors that would not have admitting
               privileges in the absence of such Participating hospital.

          e)   In addition to the notification required in (a) above, the
               Contractor shall develop a transition plan for Enrollees who are
               patients of the Participating Provider withdrawing from the
               Contractor's network subject to approval by SDOH. SDOH may direct
               the Contractor to provide notice to the Enrollees who are
               patients of PCPs or specialists including available options for
               the patients, and availability of continuing care, consistent
               with Section 13.8 of this Agreement, not less than thirty (30)
               days prior to the termination or expiration of the Provider
               Agreement. In the event that Provider Agreements are terminated
               or are not renewed with less than the notice period required by
               this Section, the Contractor shall immediately notify SDOH, and
               develop a transition plan on an expedited basis and provide
               notice to affected Enrollees upon SDOH consent to the transition
               plan and Enrollee notice.


                                   SECTION 22
                     (SUBCONTRACTS AND PROVIDER AGREEMENTS)

          f)   Upon Contractor notice of failure to renew, or termination of, a
               Provider Agreement, the SDOH, in its sole discretion, may waive
               the requirement of submission of a contingency plan upon a
               determination by the SDOH that:

               i)   the impact upon Enrollees is not significant, and/or

               ii)  the Contractor and Participating Provider are continuing to
                    negotiate in good faith and consent to extend the Provider
                    Agreement for a period of time necessary to provide not less
                    than thirty (30) days notice to Enrollees.

          g)   SDOH reserves the right to take any other action permitted by
               this Agreement and under regulatory or statutory authority,
               including but not limited to terminating this Agreement.

     22.13 Physician Incentive Plan

          a)   If Contractor elects to operate a Physician Incentive Plan, the
               Contractor agrees that no specific payment will be made directly
               or indirectly to a Participating Provider that is a physician or
               physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically
               necessary services furnished to an Enrollee. Contractor agrees to
               submit to SDOH annual reports containing the information on its
               Physician Incentive Plan in accordance with 42 CFR Section
               438.6(h). The contents of such reports shall comply with the
               requirements of 42 CFR Section 422.208 and 422.210 and be in a
               format to be provided by SDOH.

          b)   The Contractor must ensure that any Provider Agreements for
               services covered by this Agreement, such as agreements between
               the Contractor and other entities or between the Contractor's
               subcontracted entities and their contractors, at all levels
               including the physician level, include language requiring that
               the Physician Incentive Plan information be provided by the
               sub-contractor in an accurate and timely manner to the
               Contractor, in the format requested by SDOH.

          c)   In the event that the incentive arrangements place the
               Participating physician or physician group at risk for services
               beyond those provided directly by the physician or physician
               group for an amount beyond the risk threshold of twenty-five
               percent (25%) of potential payments for covered services
               (substantial financial risk), the Contractor must comply with all
               additional requirements listed in regulation, such as: conduct
               Enrollee/disenrollee satisfaction surveys; disclose the
               requirements for the Physician Incentive Plans to its
               beneficiaries upon request; and ensure that all physicians and
               physician groups at substantial financial risk have adequate
               stop-loss protection. Any of these additional requirements that
               are passed on to the subcontractors must be clearly stated in
               their Provider Agreement.

          requirements of 42 CFR Section 438.608.

     23.2 Prevention Plans and Special Investigation Units

          If the Contractor has over 10,000 Enrollees in the aggregate in any

          unit for the detection, investigation and prevention of fraudulent
          activities to the extent required by PHL Section 4414 and SDOH
          regulations.

24.  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT COMPLIANCE PLAN

     Contractor must comply with Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the
     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for program accessibility, and must develop an
     ADA Compliance Plan consistent with the SDOH Guidelines for MCO Compliance
     with the ADA set forth in Appendix J, which is hereby made a part of this
     Agreement as if set forth fully herein. Said plan must be approved by the
     SDOH, be filed with the SDOH, and be kept on file by the Contractor.

25.  FAIR HEARINGS

     25.1 Enrollee Access to Fair Hearing Process

          Enrollees may access the fair hearing process in accordance with
          applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Contractors must
          abide by and participate in New York State's Fair Hearing Process and
          comply with determinations made by a fair hearing officer.

     25.2 Enrollee Rights to a Fair Hearing

          Enrollees may request a fair hearing regarding adverse LDSS
          determinations concerning enrollment, disenrollment and eligibility,
          and regarding the denial, termination, suspension or reduction of a
          clinical treatment or other Benefit Package services by the
          Contractor. For issues related to disputed services, Enrollees must
          have received an adverse determination from the Contractor or its
          approved utilization review agent either overriding a recommendation
          to provide services by a Participating Provider or confirming the
          decision of a Participating Provider to deny those services. An
          Enrollee may also seek a fair hearing for a failure by the Contractor
          to act with reasonable promptness with respect to such services.
          Reasonable promptness shall mean compliance with the timeframes
          established for review of grievances and utilization review in
          Sections 44 and 49

               as provided in Appendix F of this Agreement.

          b)   Contractor agrees to serve notice on affected Enrollees by mail
               and must maintain documentation of such.

     25.4 Aid Continuing

          a)   Contractor shall be required to continue the provision of the
               Benefit Package services that are the subject of the fair hearing
               to an Enrollee (hereafter referred to as "aid continuing") if so
               ordered by the NYS Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) under
               the following circumstances:

               i)   Contractor has or is seeking to reduce, suspend or terminate
                    a treatment or Benefit Package service currently being
                    provided;

               ii)  Enrollee has filed a timely request for a fair hearing with
                    OAH; and

               iii) There is a valid order for the treatment or service from a
                    Participating Provider.

          b)   Contractor shall provide aid continuing until the matter has been
               resolved to the Enrollee's satisfaction or until the
               administrative process is completed and there is a determination
               from OAH that Enrollee is not entitled to receive the service;
               the Enrollee withdraws the request for aid continuing and/or the
               fair hearing in writing; or the treatment or service originally
               ordered by the provider has been completed, whichever occurs
               first.

          c)   If the services and/or benefits in dispute have been terminated,
               suspended or reduced and the Enrollee timely requests a fair
               hearing, Contractor shall, at the direction of either SDOH or
               LDSS, restore the disputed services and/or benefits consistent
               with the provisions of Section 25.4 (b) of this Agreement.

     25.5 Responsibilities of SDOH

          schedules and directives regarding fair hearings.

     25.6 Contractor's Obligations

          a)   Contractor shall appear at all scheduled fair hearings concerning
               its clinical determinations and/or Contractor-initiated
               disenrollments to present evidence as justification for its
               determination or submit written evidence as justification for its
               determination regarding the disputed benefits and/or services. If
               Contractor will not be making a personal appearance at the fair
               hearing, the written material must be submitted to OAH and
               Enrollee or Enrollee's representative at least three (3) business
               days prior to the scheduled hearing. If the hearing is scheduled
               fewer than three (3) business days after the request, Contractor
               must deliver the evidence to the hearing site no later than one
               (1) business day prior to the hearing, otherwise Contractor must
               appear in person. Notwithstanding the above provisions,
               Contractor may be required to make a personal appearance at the
               discretion of the hearing officer and/or SDOH.

          b)   Despite an Enrollee's request for a State fair hearing in any
               given dispute, Contractor is required to maintain and operate in
               good faith its own internal Complaint and Appeal processes as
               required under state and federal laws and by Section 14 and
               Appendix F of this Agreement. Enrollees may seek redress of
               Adverse Determinations simultaneously through Contractor's
               internal process and the State fair hearing process. If
               Contractor has reversed its initial determination and provided
               the service to the Enrollee, Contractor may request a waiver from
               appearing at the hearing and, in submitted papers, explain that
               it has withdrawn its initial determination and is providing the
               service or treatment formerly in dispute.

          c)   Contractor shall comply with all determinations rendered by OAH
               at fair hearings. Contractor shall cooperate with SDOH efforts to
               ensure that Contractor is in compliance with fair hearing
               determinations. Failure by Contractor to maintain such compliance
               shall constitute breach of this Agreement. Nothing in this
               Section shall limit the remedies available to SDOH, LDSS or the
               federal government relating to any non-compliance by Contractor
               with a fair hearing determination or Contractor's refusal to
               provide disputed services.

          d)   If SDOH investigates a Complaint that has as its basis the same
               dispute that is the subject of a pending fair hearing and, as a
               result of its investigation, concludes that the disputed services
               and/or benefits should be provided to the Enrollee, Contractor
               shall comply with SDOH's directive to provide those services
               and/or benefits and provide notice to OAH and Enrollee as
               required by Section 25.6(b) of this Agreement.

          e)   If SDOH, through its Complaint investigation process, or OAH, by
               a determination after a fair hearing, directs Contractor to
               provide a service that was initially denied by Contractor,
               Contractor may either directly provide the service, arrange for
               the provision of that service or pay for the provision of


                             SECTION 23 - SECTION 36
                                 October 1, 2005

<PAGE>

               that service by a Non-Participating Provider. If the services
               were not furnished during the period the fair hearing was
               pending, the Contractor must authorize or furnish the disputed
               services promptly and as expeditiously as the Enrollee's health
               condition requires.

          f)   Contractor agrees to abide by changes made to this Section of the
               Agreement with respect to the fair hearing, Action, Service
               Authorization, Complaint and Appeal processes by SDOH in order to
               comply with any amendments to applicable state or federal
               statutes or regulations.

          g)   Contractor agrees to identify a contact person within its
               organization who will serve as a liaison to SDOH for the purpose
               of receiving fair hearing requests, scheduled fair hearing dates
               and adjourned fair hearing dates and compliance with State
               directives. Such individual: shall be accessible to the State by
               e-mail; shall monitor e-mail for correspondence from the State at
               least once every business day; and shall agree, on behalf of
               Contractor, to accept notices to Contractor transmitted via
               e-mail as legally valid.

          h)   The information describing fair hearing rights, aid continuing,
               Action, Service Authorization, utilization review, Complaint and
               Appeal procedures shall be included in all MMC and FHPlus member
               handbooks and shall comply with Section 14, Appendices E and F of
               this Agreement.

          i)   Contractor shall bear the burden of proof at hearings regarding
               the reduction, suspension or termination of ongoing services. In
               the event that Contractor's initial adverse determination is
               upheld as a result of a fair hearing, any aid continuing provided
               pursuant to that hearing request, may be recouped by Contractor.

26.  EXTERNAL APPEAL

     26.1 Basis for External Appeal

          Enrollees are eligible to request an External Appeal when one or more
          covered health care services have been denied by the Contractor on the
          basis that the service(s) is not medically necessary or is
          experimental or investigational.

     26.2 Eligibility for External Appeal

          An Enrollee is eligible for an External Appeal when the Enrollee has
          exhausted the Contractor's internal utilization review procedure, has
          received a final adverse determination from the Contractor, or the
          Enrollee and the Contractor have agreed to waive internal Appeal
          procedures in accordance with PHL Section 4914(2)2(a). A provider is
          also eligible for an External Appeal of retrospective denials.

<PAGE>

     26.3 External Appeal Determination

          The External Appeal determination is binding on the Contractor;

          determination for Enrollees.

     26.4 Compliance with External Appeal Laws and Regulations

          The Contractor must comply with the provisions of Sections 4910-4914

          process and the timeframes for External Appeal, in the Member

     The parties to the attached contract, license, lease, amendment or other
agreement of any kind (hereinafter, "the contract" or "this contract") agree to

amendment for any amount to a contract which, as so amended, exceeds said
statutory amount, or if, by this contract, the State agrees to give something

contract. If this is a building service contract as defined in Section 230 of

State Finance Law, if this contract was awarded based upon the submission of
bids, Contractor warrants, under penalty of perjury, that its bid was arrived at
independently and without collusion aimed at restricting competition. Contractor
further warrants that, at the time Contractor submitted its bid, an authorized
and responsible person executed and delivered to the State a non-collusive
bidding certification on Contractor's behalf.

Labor Law and Section 139-h of the State Finance Law, if this contract exceeds

partnership or corporation has participated, is participating, or shall
participate in an international boycott in violation of the federal Export
Administration Act of 1979 (50 USC App. Sections 2401 et seq.) or regulations

State official, in writing, that said records should not be disclosed; and (ii)

York State standard vouchers submitted for payment for the sale of goods or
services or the lease of real or personal property to a New York State agency
must include the payee's identification number, i.e., the seller's or lessor's
identification number. The number is either the payee's Federal employer
identification number or Federal social security number, or both such numbers
when the payee has both such numbers. Failure to include this number or numbers
may delay payment. Where the payee does not have such number or numbers, the
payee, on its invoice or New York State standard voucher, must give the reason
or reasons why the payee does not have such number or numbers.

(b) PRIVACY NOTIFICATION. (1) The authority to request the above personal
information from a seller of goods or services or a lessor of real or personal
property, and the authority to maintain such information, is found in Section 5
of the State Tax Law. Disclosure of this information by the seller or lessor to
the State is mandatory. The principal purpose for which the information is
collected is to enable the State to identify individuals, businesses and others
who have been delinquent in filing tax returns or may have understated their tax
liabilities and to generally identify persons affected by the taxes administered
by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. The information will be used for
tax administration purposes and for any other purpose authorized by law.

mean recruitment, employment, job assignment, promotion, upgradings, demotion,
transfer, layoff, or termination and rates of pay or other forms of
compensation;

(b) at the request of the contracting agency, the Contractor shall request each
employment agency, labor union, or authorized representative of workers with

compliance by a contractor or subcontractor with the requirements of any federal
law concerning equal employment opportunity which effectuates the purpose of
this section. The contracting agency shall determine whether the imposition of
the requirements of the provisions hereof duplicate or conflict with any such
federal law and if such duplication or conflict exists, the contracting agency
shall waive the applicability of Section 312 to the extent of such duplication
or conflict. Contractor will comply with all duly promulgated and lawful rules
and regulations of the Governor's Office of Minority and Women's Business
Development pertaining hereto.

                               MARKETING MATERIALS

1.   DEFINITIONS

     a)   Marketing materials generally include the concepts of advertising,
          public service announcements, printed publications, and other
          broadcast or electronic messages designed to increase awareness and
          interest in the Medicaid Managed Care Program or the FHPlus Program
          and/or the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product. The target audience for
          MMC Marketing materials is MMC Eligible Persons who are not enrolled
          in a MCO offering a MMC product, and who are living in the
          Contractor's service area, if the Contractor offers a MMC product. The
          target audience for FHPlus Marketing materials is low-income uninsured
          people who do not qualify for Medicaid, who are living in the
          Contractor's service area, if the Contractor offers a FHPlus product.

     b)   Marketing materials include any information that references the MMC or
          FHPlus Program, is intended for general distribution, and is produced
          in a variety of print, broadcast, and direct Marketing mediums. These
          generally include: radio, television, billboards, newspapers,
          leaflets, informational brochures, videos, telephone book yellow page
          ads, letters, and posters. Additional materials requiring Marketing
          approval include a listing of items to be provided as nominal gifts or
          incentives.

2.   MARKETING MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS

     a)   Marketing materials must be written in prose that is understood at a
          fourth-to sixth-grade reading level and must be printed in at least
          ten (10) point type.

     b)   Marketing materials must be made available throughout the Contractor's
          entire service area. Materials may be customized for specific counties
          and populations within the Contractor's service area. All Marketing
          activities should provide for equitable distribution of materials
          without bias toward or against any group.

     c)   The Contractor must make available written Marketing and other
          informational materials (e.g., member handbooks) in a language other
          than English whenever at least five percent (5%) of the Prospective
          Enrollees of the Contractor in any county of the service area speak
          that particular language and do not speak English as a first language.
          SDOH will inform the Contractor when the five percent (5%) threshold
          has been reached. Marketing materials to be translated include those
          key materials, such as informational brochures, that are produced for
          routine distribution, and which are included within the Contractor's
          Marketing plan. SDOH will determine the need for other-than-English
          translations based on county-specific census data or other available
          measures.

     d)   Alternate forms of communications must be provided for persons with
          visual, hearing, speech, physical, or developmental disabilities.
          These alternate forms

          of all multi-paged Marketing materials.

     f)   Marketing materials must not contain false, misleading, or ambiguous
          information-- such as "You have been pre-approved for the XYZ Health
          Plan," or "If you do not choose a plan you will lose your Medicaid
          coverage," or "You get free, unlimited visits." Materials must not use
          broad, sweeping statements.

     g)   The material must accurately reflect general information, which is
          applicable to the average consumer of the MMC Program or FHPlus
          Program.

     h)   The Contractor may not use logos or wording used by government
          agencies if such use could imply or cause confusion about a connection
          between a governmental agency and the Contractor.

          available to Enrollees after they enroll in the Contractor's MMC or

          by the LDSS, Enrollment Broker, or SDOH-approved Enrollment
          Facilitators, must be provided in a manner that is easily understood
          and appropriate to the target audience. The material covered must
          include sufficient information to assist the individual in making an
          informed choice of MCO.

     k)   The Contractor shall advise Prospective Enrollees, in written
          materials related to Enrollment, to verify with the medical services
          providers they prefer, or have an existing relationship with, that
          such medical services providers are Participating Providers of the
          selected MCO and are available to serve the Enrollee.

     l)   Marketing materials shall not mention other MCOs offering MMC or
          FHPlus products by name except for materials approved by SDOH and
          developed to present available MCO choices in an unbiased manner, or
          as part of a transition of Enrollees from an MCO that withdraws from
          the MMC or FHPlus Program.

3.   PRIOR APPROVALS

          whereby materials submitted by the Contractor must be reviewed and
          commented on within sixty (60) days of submission or the Contractor
          may assume the materials have been approved if the reviewer has not
          submitted any written comment.

          Broker and/or SDOH-approved Enrollment Facilitators, sufficient

     c)   The Contractor shall not offer compensation to Marketing
          Representatives, including salary increases or bonuses, based solely
          on the number of individuals they enroll. However, the Contractor may

               life or health or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum
               function. The Enrollee may request expedited review of a Prior
               Authorization Request or Concurrent Review Request. If the
               Contractor denies the Enrollee's request for expedited review,

               authorize a service in an amount, duration, or scope that is less
               than requested, must be made by a licensed, certified, or

               Determination was based on medical necessity, the determination
               must be made by a clinical peer reviewer as defined by PHL

               timeframe specified in Section 3 below. Notice to the provider
               must contain the same information as the Notice of Action for the
               Enrollee.

               billing for Benefit Package services not included in the Provider
               Agreement between the Contractor and the Participating Provider.

     b)   The Contractor is not required to provide written Notice of Action to
          Enrollees in the following circumstances:

          i)   When there is a prepaid capitation arrangement with a
               Participating Provider and the Participating Provider submits a
               fee-for-service claim to the Contractor for a service that falls
               within the capitation payment;

          ii)  if a Participating Provider of the Contractor itemizes or
               "unbundles" a claim for services encompassed by a previously
               negotiated global fee arrangement;

          iii) if a duplicate claim is submitted by the Enrollee or a
               Participating Provider, no notice is required, provided an
               initial notice has been issued;

          iv)  if the claim is for a service that is carved-out of the MMC
               Benefit Package and is provided to a MMC Enrollee through
               Medicaid fee-for-service, however, the Contractor should notify
               the provider to submit the claim to Medicaid;

          v)   if the Contractor makes a coding adjustment to a claim (up-coding
               or down-coding) and its Provider Agreement with the Participating
               Provider includes a provision allowing the Contractor to make
               such adjustments;

          vi)  if the Contractor has paid the negotiated amount reflected in the
               Provider Agreement with a Participating Provider for the services
               provided to the Enrollee and denies the Participating Provider's
               request for additional payment; or

          vii) if the Contractor has not yet adjudicated the claim. If the
               Contractor has pended the claim while requesting additional
               information, a notice is not required until the coverage
               determination has been made.

                          GRIEVANCE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

1.   DEFINITIONS

     a)   A Grievance System means the Contractor's Complaint and Appeal
          process, and includes a Complaint and Complaint Appeal process, a
          process to appeal Actions, and access to the State's fair hearing
          system.

     b)   For the purposes of this Agreement, a Complaint means an Enrollee's
          expression of dissatisfaction with any aspect of his or her care other

          information posed to the Contractor with regard to such issues as
          benefits, contracts, and organization rules. Neither Enrollee

          providing interpreter services and toll-free numbers with TTY/TDD and
          interpreter capability.

     c)   The Enrollee may designate a representative to file Complaints,
          Complaint Appeals and Action Appeals on his/her behalf.

          Appeal or Action Appeal.


                                   APPENDIX F
                                 October 1, 2005
                                       F-8

<PAGE>

     e)   The Contractor's procedures for accepting Complaints, Complaint
          Appeals and Action Appeals shall include:

          i)   toll-free telephone number;

          ii)  designated staff to receive calls;

          iii) "live" phone coverage at least forty (40) hours a week during
               normal business hours;

                    respond to all such calls no later than on the next business
                    day after the calls were recorded; or

               B)   a mechanism to have available on a twenty-four (24) hour,
                    seven (7) day a week basis designated staff to accept
                    telephone Complaints, whenever a delay would significantly
                    increase the risk to an Enrollee's health.

     f)   The Contractor must ensure that personnel making determinations
          regarding Complaints, Complaint Appeals and Action Appeals were not
          involved in previous levels of review or decision-making. If any of
          the following applies, determinations must be made by qualified
          clinical personnel as specified in this Appendix:

          i)   A denial Action Appeal based on lack of medical necessity.

          ii)  A Complaint regarding denial of expedited resolution of an Action
               Appeal.

          iii) A Complaint, Complaint Appeal, or Action Appeal that involves
               clinical issues.

3.   ACTION APPEALS PROCESS

     a)   The Contractor's Action Appeals process shall indicate the following
          regarding resolution of Appeals of an Action:

          i)   The Enrollee, or his or her designee, will have no less than
               sixty (60) business days from the date of the notice of Action to
               file an Action Appeal. An Enrollee filing an Action Appeal within
               10 days of the notice of Action or by the intended date of an
               Action, whichever is later, that involves the reduction,
               suspension, or termination of previously approved services may
               request "aid continuing" in accordance with Section 25.4 of this
               Agreement.

          ii)  The Enrollee may file a written Action Appeal or an oral Action
               Appeal. Oral Action Appeals must be followed by a written,
               signed, Action Appeal. The Contractor may provide a written
               summary of an oral Action Appeal to the Enrollee (with the
               acknowledgement or separately) for the Enrollee to review,


                                   APPENDIX F
                                 October 1, 2005
                                       F-9

<PAGE>

               modify if needed, sign and return to the Contractor. If the
               Enrollee or provider requests expedited resolution of the Action
               Appeal, the oral Action Appeal does not need to be confirmed in
               writing. The date of the oral filing of the Action Appeal will be
               the date of the Action Appeal for the purposes of the timeframes
               for resolution of Action Appeals. Action Appeals resulting from a
               Concurrent Review must be handled as an expedited Action Appeal.

          iii) The Contractor must send a written acknowledgement of the Action
               Appeal within fifteen (15) days of receipt. If a determination is
               reached before the written acknowledgement is sent, the
               Contractor may include the written acknowledgement with the
               notice of Action Appeal determination (one notice).

          iv)  The Contractor must provide the Enrollee reasonable opportunity
               to present evidence, and allegations of fact or law, in person as
               well as in writing. The Contractor must inform the Enrollee of
               the limited time to present such evidence in the case of an
               expedited Action Appeal. The Contractor must allow the Enrollee
               or his or her designee, both before and during the Action Appeals
               process, to examine the Enrollee's case file, including medical
               records and any other documents and records considered during the
               Action Appeals process. The Contractor will consider the
               Enrollee, his or her designee, or legal estate representative of
               a deceased Enrollee a party to the Action Appeal.

          v)   The Contractor must have a process for handling expedited Action
               Appeals. Expedited resolution of the Action Appeal must be
               conducted when the Contractor determines or the provider
               indicates that a delay would seriously jeopardize the Enrollee's
               life or health or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum
               function. The Enrollee may request an expedited review of an
               Action Appeal. If the Contractor denies the Enrollee's request
               for an expedited review, the Contractor must handle the request
               under standard Action Appeal resolution timeframes, make
               reasonable efforts to provide prompt oral notice of the denial to
               the Enrollee and send written notice of the denial within two (2)
               days of the denial determination.

          vi)  The Contractor must ensure that punitive action is not taken
               against a provider who either requests an expedited resolution or
               supports an Enrollee's Appeal.

          vii) Action Appeals of clinical matters must be decided by personnel
               qualified to review the Action Appeal, including licensed,
               certified or registered health care professionals who did not
               make the initial determination, at least one of whom must be a
               clinical peer reviewer, as defined by PHL Section 4900(2)(a).
               Action Appeals of non-clinical matters shall be determined by
               qualified personnel at a higher level than the personnel who made
               the original determination.


                                   APPENDIX F

               Enrollee's condition requires, and no later than thirty (30) days
               from the date of the receipt of the Action Appeal.

          ii)  The Contractor will resolve expedited Action Appeals as fast as
               the Enrollee's condition requires, within two (2) business days
               of receipt of necessary information and no later than three (3)
               business days of the date of the receipt of the Action Appeal.

          iii) Timeframes for Action Appeal resolution may be extended for up to
               fourteen (14) days if:

               A)   the Enrollee, his or her designee, or the provider requests
                    an extension orally or in writing; or

               B)   the Contractor can demonstrate or substantiate that there is
                    a need for additional information and the extension is in
                    the Enrollee's interest. The Contractor must send notice of
                    the extension to the Enrollee. The Contractor must maintain
                    sufficient documentation of extension determinations to
                    demonstrate, upon SDOH's request, that the extension was
                    justified.

          iv)  The Contractor will make a reasonable effort to provide oral
               notice to the Enrollee, his or her designee, and the provider
               where appropriate, for expedited Action Appeals at the time the
               Action Appeal determination is made.

          v)   The Contractor must send written notice to the Enrollee, his or
               her designee, and the provider where appropriate, within two (2)
               business days of the Action Appeal determination.

5.   ACTION APPEAL NOTICES

     a)   The Contractor shall ensure that all notices are in writing and in
          easily understood language and are accessible to non-English speaking
          and visually impaired Enrollees. Notices shall include that oral
          interpretation and alternate formats of written material for Enrollees
          with special needs are available and how to access the alternate
          formats.

          i)   Notice to the Enrollee that the Enrollee's request for an

6.   COMPLAINT PROCESS

     a)   The Contractor' Complaint process shall include the following

1.   DEFINITIONS

     a)   "EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION" means a medical or behavioral condition,
          the onset of which is sudden, that manifests itself by symptoms of
          sufficient severity, including severe pain, that a prudent layperson,
          possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health, could
          reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result
          in:

          i)   placing the health of the person afflicted with such condition in
               serious jeopardy or, in the case of a pregnant woman, the health
               of the woman or her unborn child or, in the case of a behavioral
               condition, placing the health of the person or others in serious
               jeopardy; or

          ii)  serious impairment to such person's bodily functions; or

          iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of such person;
               or

     b)   "EMERGENCY SERVICES" means health care procedures, treatments or
          services needed to evaluate or stabilize an Emergency Medical
          Condition including psychiatric stabilization and medical
          detoxification from drugs or alcohol.

     c)   "POST-STABILIZATION CARE SERVICES" means covered services, related to
          an emergency medical condition, that are provided after an Enrollee is
          stabilized in order to maintain the stabilized condition, or, under
          the circumstances described in Section 3 below, to improve or resolve
          the Enrollee's condition.

2.   COVERAGE AND PAYMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

     a)   The Contractor must cover and pay for Emergency Services regardless of
          whether the provider that furnishes the services has a contract with
          the Contractor.

     b)   The Contractor must advise Enrollees that they may access Emergency
          Services at any Emergency Services provider.

          i)   An Enrollee had an Emergency Medical Condition, including cases
               in which the absence of immediate medical attention would not

               Medical Condition above.

          ii)  A representative of the Contractor instructs the Enrollee to seek
               Emergency Services.

     e)   A Contractor may not:

               lists of diagnoses or symptoms; or

               the provider or the Enrollee to give the Contractor notice of the
               emergency room visit.

     f)   An Enrollee who has an Emergency Medical Condition may not be held
          liable for payment of subsequent screening and treatment needed to
          diagnose the specific condition or stabilize the patient.

     g)   The attending emergency physician, or the provider actually treating
          the Enrollee, is responsible for determining when the Enrollee is

          ii)  they are not pre-approved by a Participating Provider, as
               authorized by the Contractor, or other authorized Contractor
               representative, but administered to maintain the Enrollee's
               stabilized condition within one (1) hour of a request to the

               representative, but administered to maintain, improve or resolve
               the Enrollee's stabilized condition if:

               A)   The Contractor does not respond to a request for

                    cannot reach an agreement concerning the Enrollee's care and

                    situation, the Contractor must give the treating physician
                    the opportunity to consult with a plan physician and the
                    treating physician may continue with care of the patient
                    until a plan physician is reached or one of the criteria in

          iv)  The Contractor must limit charges to Enrollees for
               Post-stabilization Care Services to an amount no greater than

               obtained the services through the Contractor.

     b)   The Contractor's financial responsibility to the treating emergency
          provider for Post-stabilization Care Services it has not pre-approved
          ends when:

          ii)  A plan physician assumes responsibility for the Enrollee's care
               through transfer;

          iii) A Contractor representative and the treating physician reach an
               agreement concerning the Enrollee's care or

     a)   All relevant COBRA requirements must be met.

     b)   The Contractor must provide for an appropriate (as determined by the

     c)   The Contractor must contact/arrange for an available, accepting
          physician and patient bed at the receiving institution.

1.   GENERAL

     The Contractor's Enrollment and Disenrollment procedures shall be
     consistent with these requirements, except that to allow LDSS and the
     Contractor flexibility in developing processes that will meet the needs of
     both parties, SDOH may allow modifications to timeframes and some
     procedures. Where an Enrollment Broker exists, the Enrollment Broker may be
     responsible for some or all of the LDSS responsibilities.

2.   ENROLLMENT

     a)   SDOH Responsibilities:

          i)   The SDOH is responsible for monitoring LDSS program activities
               and providing technical assistance to the LDSS and the Contractor
               to ensure compliance with the State's policies and procedures.

          ii)  SDOH reviews and approves proposed Enrollment materials prior to
               the Contractor publishing and disseminating or otherwise using
               the materials.

     b)   LDSS Responsibilities:

          i)   The LDSS has the primary responsibility for the Enrollment
               process.

          ii)  Each LDSS determines Medicaid and FHPlus eligibility. To the
               extent practicable, the LDSS will follow up with Enrollees when
               the Contractor provides documentation of any change in status
               which may affect the Enrollee's Medicaid, FHPlus, or MMC
               eligibility.

          iii) The LDSS is responsible for coordinating the Medicaid and FHPlus
               application and Enrollment processes.

          iv)  The LDSS is responsible for providing pre-enrollment information
               to Eligible Persons, consistent with Sections 364-j(4)(e)(iv) and
               369-ee of the SSL, and the training of persons providing
               Enrollment counseling to Eligible Persons.

          v)   The LDSS is responsible for informing Eligible Persons of the
               availability of MCOs and HIV SNPs offering MMC and/or FHPlus
               products and the scope of services covered by each.

          vi)  The LDSS is responsible for informing Eligible Persons of the
               right to confidential face-to-face Enrollment counseling and will
               make confidential face-to-face sessions available upon request.

          vii) The LDSS is responsible for instructing Eligible Persons to
               verify with the medical services providers they prefer, or have
               an existing relationship with, that such medical services
               providers are Participating Providers of the selected MCO and are
               available to serve the Enrollee. The LDSS includes such
               instructions to Eligible Persons in its written materials related
               to Enrollment.

          viii) For Enrollments made during face-to-face counseling, if the
               Prospective Enrollee has a preference for particular medical
               services providers, Enrollment counselors shall verify with the
               medical services providers that such medical services providers
               whom the Prospective Enrollee prefers are Participating Providers

          xiii) The LDSS is responsible for entering individual Enrollment form
               data and transmitting that data to the State's Prepaid Capitation
               Plan (PCP) Subsystem. The transfer of Enrollment information may
               be accomplished by any of the following:

               A)   LDSS directly enters data into PCP Subsystem; or

               B)   LDSS or Contractor submits a tape to the State, to be edited
                    and entered into PCP Subsystem; or

               C)   LDSS electronically transfers data, via a dedicated line or
                    Medicaid Eligibility Verification System (MEVS) to the PCP
                    Subsystem.

          xiv) The LDSS is responsible for sending the following required
               notices to Eligible Persons:

               A)   For mandatory MMC program only - Initial Notification
                    Letter: This letter informs Eligible Persons about the
                    mandatory MMC program and the timeframes for choosing a MCO
                    offering a MMC product. Included with the letter are managed
                    care brochures, an Enrollment form, and information on their
                    rights and responsibilities under this program, including
                    the option for HIV/AIDS infected individuals who are
                    categorically exempt from the mainstream MMC program to
                    enroll in an HIV SNP on a voluntary basis in LDSS
                    jurisdictions where HIV SNPs exist.

               B)   For mandatory MMC program only - Reminder Letter: A letter
                    to all Eligible Persons in a mandatory category who have not
                    responded by submitting a completed Enrollment form within
                    thirty (30) days of being sent or given an Enrollment

                    Enrollment, the name of the MCO and all individuals who are
                    being enrolled. This notice should also be used for case
                    additions and re-enrollments into the same MCO. There is no
                    requirement that an Enrollment Confirmation Notice be sent
                    to FHPlus Enrollees.

               D)   Notice of Denial of Enrollment: This notice is used when an
                    individual has been determined by LDSS to be ineligible for
                    Enrollment into the MMC or FHPlus program. This notice must
                    include fair hearing rights. This notice is not required
                    when Medicaid or FHPlus eligibility is being denied (or

                    Exclusion criteria do not need to complete an Exemption
                    request form. This notice is required for mandatory MMC
                    Eligible Persons.

               F)   For MMC program only - Exemption and Exclusion Request
                    Approval or Denial: This notice is designed to inform a
                    recipient who applied for an exemption or who failed to
                    provide documentation of exclusion criteria when requested
                    by the LDSS of the LDSS's disposition of the request,
                    including the right to a fair hearing if the request for
                    exemption or exclusion is denied. This notice is required
                    for voluntary and mandatory MMC Eligible Persons.

     c)   Contractor Responsibilities:

          i)   To the extent permitted by law and regulation, the Contractor may
               accept Enrollment forms from Potential Enrollees for the MMC
               program, provided that the appropriate education has been
               provided to the Potential Enrollee by the LDSS pursuant to
               Section 2(b) of this Appendix. In those instances, the Contractor
               will submit resulting Enrollments to the LDSS, within a maximum
               of five (5) business days from the day the Enrollment is received
               by the Contractor (unless otherwise agreed to by SDOH and LDSS).

          ii)  The Contractor must notify new MMC and FHPlus Enrollees of their
               Effective Date of Enrollment. In the event that the actual
               Effective Date of Enrollment is different from that previously
               given to the Enrollee, the Contractor must notify the Enrollee of
               the actual date of Enrollment. This may be accomplished through a
               Welcome Letter. To the extent practicable, such notification must
               precede the Effective Date of Enrollment.

          iii) The Contractor must report any changes in status for its enrolled
               members to the LDSS within five (5) business days of such
               information becoming known to the Contractor. This includes, but
               is not limited to, factors that may impact Medicaid or FHPlus
               eligibility such as address changes, verification of pregnancy,
               incarceration, third party insurance, etc.

          iv)  The Contractor shall advise Prospective Enrollees, in written
               materials related to Enrollment, to verify with the medical
               services providers they prefer, or have an existing relationship
               with, that such medical services providers are Participating
               Providers of the selected MCO and are available to serve the
               Prospective Enrollee.

          v)   The Contractor shall accept all Enrollments as ordered by the
               Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance's Office of
               Administrative Hearings due to fair hearing requests or
               decisions.

3.   NEWBORN ENROLLMENTS

     a)   The Contractor agrees to enroll and provide coverage for eligible
          newborn children effective from the time of birth.

     b)   SDOH Responsibilities:

          i)   The SDOH will update WMS with information on the newborn received
               from hospitals, consistent with the requirements of Section 366-g
               of the SSL as amended by Chapter 412 of the Laws of 1999.

          ii)  Upon notification of the birth by the hospital or birthing
               center, the SDOH will update WMS with the demographic data for
               the newborn and enroll the newborn in the mother's MCO if the
               newborn is not already enrolled, the mother's MCO offers a MMC
               product, and the newborn is not identified as SSI or SSI-related
               and therefore Excluded from the MMC Program pursuant to Section
               2(b)(xi) of this Appendix. The newborn will be retroactively
               enrolled back to the first (1st) day of the month of birth. Based
               on the transaction date of the Enrollment of the newborn on the
               PCP subsystem, the newborn will appear on either the next month's
               Roster or the subsequent month's Roster. On Rosters for upstate
               and NYC, the "PCP Effective From Date" will indicate the first
               day of the month of birth, as described in 01 OMM/ADM 5
               "Automatic Medicaid Enrollment for Newborns." If the newborn's
               Enrollment is not completed by this process, the LDSS is
               responsible for Enrollment (see (c)(iv) below).

     c)   LDSS Responsibilities:

          i)   Grant Medicaid eligibility for newborns for one (1) year if born
               to a woman eligible for and receiving Medicaid or FHPlus on the
               date of the newborn's birth.

          ii)  The LDSS is responsible for adding eligible unborns to all WMS
               cases that include a pregnant woman as soon as the pregnancy is
               medically verified.

          iii) In the event that the LDSS learns of an Enrollee's pregnancy
               prior to the Contractor, the LDSS is responsible for establishing
               Medicaid eligibility and enrolling the unborn in the Contractor's
               MMC product. If the Contractor does not offer a MMC product, the
               pregnant woman will be asked to select a MCO offering a MMC
               product for the unborn. If a MCO offering a MMC product is
               unavailable, or if Enrollment is voluntary in the LDSS
               jurisdiction and an MCO is not chosen by the mother, the newborn
               will be eligible for Medicaid fee-for-service coverage, and such
               information will be entered on the WMS.

          iv)  The LDSS is responsible for newborn Enrollment if enrollment is
               not successfully completed under the "SDOH Responsibilities"
               process as outlined in 2(b)(ii) above.


                                   APPENDIX H

     d)   Contractor Responsibilities:

          i)   The Contractor must notify the LDSS in writing of any Enrollee
               that is pregnant within thirty (30) days of knowledge of the
               pregnancy. Notifications should be transmitted to the LDSS at
               least monthly. The notifications should contain the pregnant
               woman's name, Client ID Number (CIN), and the expected date of
               confinement (EDC).

          ii)  The Contractor must send verifications of infant's demographic
               data to the LDSS, within five (5) days after knowledge of the
               birth. The demographic data must include: the mother's name and
               CIN, the newborn's name and CIN (if newborn has a CIN), sex and
               the date of birth.

          iii) In districts that use an Enrollment Broker, the Contractor shall
               not submit electronic Enrollments of newborns to the Enrollment
               Broker, because this will interfere with the retroactive
               Enrollment of the newborn back to the first (1st) day of the
               month of birth. For newborns whose mothers are not enrolled in
               the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product and who were not
               pre-enrolled into the Contractor's MMC product as unborns, the
               Contractor may submit electronic Enrollment of the newborns to
               the Enrollment Broker. In such cases, the Effective Date of
               Enrollment will be prospective.

          iv)  In voluntary MMC counties, the Contractor will accept Enrollment
               applications for unborns if that is the mothers' intent, even if
               the mothers are not and/or will not be enrolled in the
               Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product. In all counties, when a
               mother is ineligible for Enrollment or chooses not to enroll, the
               Contractor will accept Enrollment applications for pre-enrollment
               of unborns who are eligible.

          v)   The Contractor is responsible for provision of services to a
               newborn and payment of the hospital or birthing center bill if
               the mother is an Enrollee at the time of the newborn's birth,
               even if the newborn is not yet on the Roster, unless the
               Contractor does not offer a MMC product in the mother's county of
               fiscal responsibility or the newborn is Excluded from the MMC
               Program pursuant to Section 2(b)(xi) of this Appendix.

          vi)  Within fourteen (14) days of the date on which the Contractor
               becomes aware of the birth, the Contractor will issue a letter,
               informing parent(s) about the newborn's Enrollment and how to
               access care, or a member identification card.

          vii) In those cases in which the Contractor is aware of the pregnancy,
               the Contractor will ensure that enrolled pregnant women select a
               PCP for their infants prior to birth.

          viii)The Contractor will ensure that the newborn is linked with a PCP
               prior to discharge from the hospital or birthing center, in those
               instances in which the Contractor has received appropriate
               notification of birth prior to discharge.

     a)   This section only applies to a LDSS where CMS has given approval and
          the LDSS has begun mandatory Enrollment into the Medicaid Managed Care
          Program. The details of the auto-assignment process are contained in
          Section 12 of New York State's Operational Protocol for the
          Partnership Plan.

     b)   SDOH Responsibilities:

          i)   The SDOH, LDSS or Enrollment Broker will assign MMC Eligible
               Persons not pre-coded in WMS as Exempt or Excluded, who have not
               chosen a MCO offering a MMC product in the required time period,
               to a MCO offering a MMC product using an algorithm as specified
               in Section 364-j(4)(d) of the SSL.

          ii)  SDOH will ensure the auto-assignment process automatically
               updates the PCP Subsystem, and will notify MCOs offering MMC
               products of auto-assigned individuals electronically.

          iii) SDOH will notify the LDSS electronically on a daily basis of
               those individuals for whom SDOH has selected a MCO offering a MMC
               product through the Automated PCP Update Report. Note: This does
               not apply in Local Districts that utilize an Enrollment Broker.

     c)   LDSS Responsibilities:

          i)   The LDSS is responsible for tracking an individual's choice

               product, the LDSS is responsible for providing notification to
               assigned individuals regarding their Enrollment status as
               specified in Section 2 of this Appendix.

     d)   Contractor Responsibilities:

          i)   The Contractor is responsible for providing notification to
               assigned individuals regarding their Enrollment status as
               specified in Section 2 of this Appendix.

5.   ROSTER RECONCILIATION:

     a)   All Enrollments are effective the first of the month.

     b)   SDOH Responsibilities:

          i)   The SDOH maintains both the PCP subsystem Enrollment files and
               the WMS eligibility files, using data entered by the LDSS. SDOH
               uses data contained in both these files to generate the Roster.

<PAGE>

               A)   SDOH shall send the Contractor and LDSS monthly (according
                    to a schedule established by SDOH), a complete list of all
                    Enrollees for which the Contractor is expected to assume
                    medical risk beginning on the 1st of the following month
                    (First Monthly Roster). Notification to the Contractor and
                    LDSS will be accomplished via paper transmission, magnetic
                    media, or the HPN.

               B)   SDOH shall send the Contractor and LDSS monthly, at the time
                    of the first monthly roster production, a Disenrollment
                    Report listing those Enrollees from the previous month's
                    roster who were disenrolled, transferred to another MCO, or
                    whose Enrollments were deleted from the file. Notification
                    to the Contractor and LDSS will be accomplished via paper
                    transmission, magnetic media, or the HPN.

               C)   The SDOH shall also forward an error report as necessary to
                    the Contractor and LDSS.

               D)   On the first (1st) weekend after the first (1st) day of the
                    month following the generation of the first (1st) Roster,
                    SDOH shall send the Contractor and LDSS a second Roster
                    which contains any additional Enrollees that the LDSS has
                    added for Enrollment for the current month. The SDOH will
                    also include any additions to the error report that have
                    occurred since the initial error report was generated.

     c)   LDSS Responsibilities:

          i)   The LDSS is responsible for notifying the Contractor
               electronically or in writing of changes in the Roster and error
               report, no later than the end of the month. (Note: To the extent
               practicable the date specified must allow for timely notice to
               Enrollees regarding their Enrollment status. The Contractor and
               the LDSS may develop protocols for the purpose of resolving
               Roster discrepancies that remain unresolved beyond the end of the
               month.)

          ii)  Enrollment and eligibility issues are reconciled by the LDSS to
               the extent possible, through manual adjustments to the PCP
               subsystem Enrollment and WMS eligibility files, if appropriate.

     d)   Contractor Responsibilities:

          i)   The Contractor is at risk for providing Benefit Package services
               for those Enrollees listed on the 1st and 2nd Rosters for the
               month in which the 2nd Roster is generated. Contractor is not at
               risk for providing services to Enrollees who appear on the
               monthly Disenrollment report.

          ii)  The Contractor must submit claims to the State's Fiscal Agent for
               all Eligible Persons that are on the 1st and 2nd Rosters,
               adjusted to add Eligible Persons enrolled by the LDSS after
               Roster production and to remove individuals

               disenrolled by LDSS after Roster production (as notified to the
               Contractor). In the cases of retroactive Disenrollments, the
               Contractor is responsible for submitting an adjustment to void
               any previously paid premiums for the period of retroactive
               Disenrollment, where the Contractor was not at risk for the
               provision of Benefit Package services. Payment of subcapitation
               does not constitute "provision of Benefit Package services."

6.   DISENROLLMENT:

     a)   LDSS Responsibilities:

          i)   The LDSS is responsible for accepting requests for Disenrollment
               directly from Enrollees and may not require Enrollees to approach
               the Contractor for a Disenrollment form. Where an LDSS is
               authorized to mandate Enrollment, all requests for Disenrollment
               must be directed to the LDSS or the Enrollment Broker. The LDSS
               and the Enrollment Broker must utilize the State-approved
               Disenrollment forms.

          ii)  Enrollees may initiate a request for an expedited Disenrollment
               to the LDSS. The LDSS will expedite the Disenrollment process in
               those cases where an Enrollee's request for Disenrollment
               involves an urgent medical need, a complaint of non-consensual
               Enrollment or, in local districts where homeless individuals are
               exempt, homeless individuals in the shelter system. If approved,
               the LDSS will manually process the Disenrollment through the PCP
               Subsystem. MMC Enrollees who request to be disenrolled from
               managed care based on their documented HIV, ESRD, or SPMI/SED
               status are categorically eligible for an expedited Disenrollment
               on the basis of urgent medical need.

          iii) The LDSS is responsible for processing routine Disenrollment
               requests to take effect on the first (1st) day of the following
               month if the request is made BEFORE the fifteenth (15th) day of
               the month. In no event shall the Effective Date of Disenrollment
               be later than the first (1st) day of the second month after the
               month in which an Enrollee requests a Disenrollment.

          iv)  The LDSS is responsible for disenrolling Enrollees automatically
               upon death or loss of Medicaid or FHPlus eligibility. All such
               Disenrollments will be effective at the end of the month in which
               the death or loss of eligibility occurs or at the end of the last
               month of Guaranteed Eligibility, where applicable.

          v)   The LDSS is responsible for informing Enrollees of their right to
               change Contractors if there is more than one available including
               any applicable Lock-In restrictions. Enrollees subject to Lock-In
               may disenroll after the grace period for Good Cause as defined
               below. The LDSS is responsible for determining if the Enrollee
               has Good Cause and processing the Disenrollment request in
               accordance with the procedures outlined in this Appendix. The
               LDSS is responsible for providing Enrollees with notice of their
               right to request a fair hearing if their


                                   APPENDIX H

<PAGE>

               Disenrollment request is denied. Such notice must include the
               reason(s) for the denial. An Enrollee has Good Cause to disenroll
               if:

               A)   The Contractor has failed to furnish accessible and
                    appropriate medical care services or supplies to which the
                    Enrollee is entitled under the terms of the contract under
                    which the Contractor has agreed to provide services. This
                    includes, but is not limited to the failure to:

                    I)   provide primary care services;

                    II)  arrange for in-patient care, consultation with
                         specialists, or laboratory and radiological services
                         when reasonably necessary;

                    III) arrange for consultation appointments;

                    IV)  coordinate and interpret any consultation findings with
                         emphasis on continuity of medical care;

                    V)   arrange for services with qualified licensed or
                         certified providers;

                    VI)  coordinate the Enrollee's overall medical care such as
                         periodic immunizations and diagnosis and treatment of
                         any illness or injury; or

               B)   The Contractor cannot make a Primary Care Provider available
                    to the Enrollee within the time and distance standards
                    prescribed by SDOH; or

               C)   The Contractor fails to adhere to the standards prescribed
                    by SDOH and such failure negatively and specifically impacts
                    the Enrollee; or

               D)   The Enrollee moves his/her residence out of the Contractor's
                    service area or to a county where the Contractor does not
                    offer the product the Enrollee is eligible for; or

               E)   The Enrollee meets the criteria for an Exemption or
                    Exclusion as set forth in 2(b)(xi) of this Appendix; or

               F)   It is determined by the LDSS, the SDOH, or its agent that
                    the Enrollment was not consensual; or

               G)   The Enrollee, the Contractor and the LDSS agree that a
                    change of MCOs would be in the best interest of the
                    Enrollee; or

               H)   The Contractor is a primary care partial capitation provider
                    that does not have a utilization review process in
                    accordance with Title I of Article 49 of the PHL and the
                    Enrollee requests Enrollment in an MCO that has such a
                    utilization review process; or

               I)   The Contractor has elected not to cover the Benefit Package
                    service that an Enrollee seeks and the service is offered by
                    one or more other MCOs in the Enrollee's county of fiscal
                    responsibility; or

               J)   The Enrollee's medical condition requires related services
                    to be performed at the same time but all such related
                    services cannot be arranged by the

                    Contractor because the Contractor has elected not to cover
                    one of the services the Enrollee seeks, and the Enrollee's
                    Primary Care Provider or another provider determines that
                    receiving the services separately would subject the Enrollee
                    to unnecessary risk; or

               K)   An FHPlus Enrollee is pregnant.

          vi)  An Enrollee subject to Lock-In may initiate Disenrollment for
               Good Cause by filing an oral or written request with the LDSS.

          vii) The LDSS is responsible for promptly disenrolling an MMC Enrollee
               whose MMC eligibility or health status changes such that he/she
               is deemed by the LDSS to meet the Exclusion criteria. The LDSS
               will provide the MMC Enrollee with a notice of his or her right
               to request a fair hearing.

          viii) In instances where an MMC Enrollee requests Disenrollment due to
               MMC Exclusion, the LDSS must notify the MMC Enrollee of the
               approval or denial of exclusion/Disenrollment status, including
               fair hearing rights if Disenrollment is denied.

          ix)  The LDSS is responsible for ensuring that retroactive
               Disenrollments are used only when absolutely necessary.
               Circumstances warranting a retroactive Disenrollment are rare and
               include when an Enrollee is determined to have been
               non-consensually enrolled in a MCO; he or she enters or resides
               in a residential institution under circumstances which render the
               individual Excluded from the MMC program; is incarcerated; is an
               SSI infant less than six (6) months of age; is simultaneously in
               receipt of comprehensive health care coverage from an MCO and is
               Enrolled in either the MMC or FHPlus product of the same MCO; it
               is determined that an Enrollee with more than one Client
               Identification Number (CIN) is enrolled in an MCO's MMC or FHPlus
               product under more than one of the CINs; or he or she has died -
               as long as the Contractor was not at risk for provision of
               Benefit Package services for any portion of the retroactive
               period. Payment of subcapitation does not constitute "provision
               of Benefit Package services." The LDSS is responsible for
               notifying the Contractor of the retroactive Disenrollment prior
               to the action. The LDSS is responsible for finding out if the
               Contractor has made payments to providers on behalf of the
               Enrollee prior to Disenrollment. After this information is
               obtained, the LDSS and Contractor will agree on a retroactive
               Disenrollment or prospective Disenrollment date. In all cases of
               retroactive Disenrollment, including Disenrollments effective the
               first day of the current month, the LDSS is responsible for
               sending notice to the Contractor at the time of Disenrollment, of
               the Contractor's responsibility to submit to the SDOH's Fiscal
               Agent voided premium claims for any full months of retroactive
               Disenrollment where the Contractor was not at risk for the
               provision of Benefit Package services during the month. However,
               failure by the LDSS to so notify the Contractor does not affect
               the right of the SDOH to recover the premium payment as
               authorized by Section 3.6 of this Agreement.

(1)  In counties outside of New York City, LDSSs should work together to ensure
     continuity of care through the Contractor if the Contractor's service area
     includes the county to which the Enrollee has moved and the Enrollee, with
     continuous eligibility, wishes to stay enrolled in the Contractor's MMC or
     FHPlus product. In New York City, Enrollees, not in guaranteed status, who
     move out of the Contractor's Service Area but not outside of the City of
     New York (e.g., move from one borough to another), will not be
     involuntarily disenrolled, but must request a Disenrollment or transfer.
     These Disenrollments will be performed on a routine basis unless there is
     an urgent medical need to expedite the Disenrollment.

          xi)  The LDSS is responsible for rendering a determination and
               responding within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a fully
               documented request for Disenrollment, except for
               Contractor-initiated Disenrollments where the LDSS decision must
               be made within fifteen (15) days. The LDSS, to the extent
               possible, is responsible for processing an expedited
               Disenrollment within two (2) business days of its determination
               that an expedited Disenrollment is warranted.

          xii) The Contractor must respond timely to LDSS inquiries regarding
               Good Cause Disenrollment requests to enable the LDSS to make a
               determination within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the
               request from the Enrollee.

          xiii) The LDSS is responsible for sending the following notices to
               Enrollees regarding their Disenrollment status. Where
               practicable, the process will allow for timely notification to
               Enrollees unless there is Good Cause to disenroll more
               expeditiously.

               A)   Notice of Disenrollment: This notice will advise the
                    Enrollee of the LDSS's determination regarding an
                    Enrollee-initiated, LDSS-initiated or Contractor- initiated
                    Disenrollment and will include the Effective Date of
                    Disenrollment. In cases where the Enrollee is being
                    involuntarily disenrolled, the notice must contain fair
                    hearing rights.

               B)   When the LDSS denies any Enrollee's request for
                    Disenrollment pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, the
                    LDSS is responsible for informing the Enrollee in writing,
                    explaining the reason for the denial, stating the facts upon
                    which the denial is based, citing the statutory and
                    regulatory authority and advising the Enrollee of his/her
                    right to a fair hearing pursuant to 18NYCRR Part 358.

               C)   End of Lock-In Notice: Where Lock-In provisions are
                    applicable, Enrollees must be notified sixty (60) days
                    before the end of their Lock-In Period. The SDOH or its
                    designee is responsible for notifying Enrollees of this
                    provision in applicable LDSS jurisdictions.

               D)   Notice of Change to Guarantee Coverage: This notice will
                    advise the Enrollee that his or her Medicaid or FHPlus
                    eligibility is ending and how this affects his or her
                    Enrollment in a MCO's MMC or FHPlus product. This notice
                    contains pertinent information regarding Guaranteed
                    Eligibility benefits and dates of coverage. If an Enrollee
                    is not eligible for Guarantee, this notice is not necessary.

          xiv) The LDSS may require that a MMC Enrollee that has been
               disenrolled at the request of the Contractor be returned to the
               Medicaid fee-for-service program. In the FHPlus program, a FHPlus
               Enrollee disenrolled at the request of the Contractor, may choose
               another MCO offering a FHPlus product. If the FHPlus Enrollee
               does not choose, or there is not another MCO offering FHPlus in
               the LDSS jurisdiction, the case will be closed.

          xv)  In those instances where the LDSS approves the Contractor's
               request to disenroll an Enrollee, and the Enrollee requests a
               fair hearing, the Enrollee will remain enrolled in the
               Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product until the disposition of the
               fair hearing if Aid to Continue is ordered by the New York State
               Office of Administrative Hearings.

          xvi) The LDSS is responsible for reviewing each Contractor-requested
               Disenrollment in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.7 of
               this Agreement and this Appendix. Where applicable, the LDSS may
               consult with local mental health and substance abuse authorities
               in the district when making the determination to approve or
               disapprove the request.

          xvii) The LDSS is responsible for establishing procedures whereby the
               Contractor refers cases which are appropriate for an
               LDSS-initiated Disenrollment and submits supporting documentation
               to the LDSS.

          xviii) After the LDSS receives and, if appropriate, approves the
               request for Disenrollment either from the Enrollee or the
               Contractor, the LDSS is responsible for updating the PCP
               subsystem file with an end date. The Enrollee is removed from the
               Contractor's Roster.

     b)   Contractor Responsibilities:

          i)   In those instances where the Contractor directly receives
               Disenrollment forms, the Contractor will forward these
               Disenrollments to the LDSS for processing within five (5)
               business days (or according to Section 6 of this Appendix).
               During pulldown week, these forms may be faxed to the LDSS with
               the hard copy to follow.

          ii)  The Contractor must accept and transmit all requests for
               voluntary Disenrollments from its Enrollees to the LDSS, and
               shall not impose any barriers to Disenrollment requests. The
               Contractor may require that a Disenrollment request be in
               writing, contain the signature of the Enrollee, and state the
               Enrollee's correct Contractor or Medicaid identification number.

          iii) Following LDSS procedures, the Contractor will refer cases which
               are appropriate for an LDSS-initiated Disenrollment and will
               submit supporting documentation to the LDSS. This includes, but
               is not limited to, changes in status for its Enrollees that may
               impact eligibility for Enrollment such as address changes,
               incarceration, death, Exclusion from the MMC program, etc.

          iv)  Pursuant to Section 8.7 of this Agreement, the Contractor may
               initiate an involuntary Disenrollment if the Enrollee engages in
               conduct or behavior that seriously impairs the Contractor's
               ability to furnish services to either the Enrollee or other
               Enrollees, provided that the Contractor has made and


                                   APPENDIX H
                                 October 1, 2005

<PAGE>

               documented reasonable efforts to resolve the problems presented
               by the Enrollee.

          v)   The Contractor may not request Disenrollment because of an
               adverse change in the Enrollee's health status, or because of the
               Enrollee's utilization of medical services, diminished mental
               capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from
               the Enrollee's special needs (except where continued Enrollment
               in the Contractor's MMC or FHPlus product seriously impairs the
               Contractor's ability to furnish services to either the Enrollee
               or other Enrollees).

          vi)  The Contractor must make a reasonable effort to identify for the
               Enrollee, both verbally and in writing, those actions of the
               Enrollee that have interfered with the effective provision of
               covered services as well as explain what actions or procedures
               are acceptable.

          vii) The Contractor shall give prior verbal and written notice to the
               Enrollee, with a copy to the LDSS, of its intent to request
               Disenrollment. The written notice shall advise the Enrollee that
               the request has been forwarded to the LDSS for review and
               approval. The written notice must include the mailing address and
               telephone number of the LDSS.

          viii) The Contractor shall keep the LDSS informed of decisions related
               to all complaints filed by an Enrollee as a result of, or
               subsequent to, the notice of intent to disenroll.

          ix)  The Contractor will not consider an Enrollee disenrolled without
               confirmation from the LDSS or the Roster (as described in Section
               5 of this Appendix).

                                 October 1, 2005

                          MEDICAL RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS

1.   MEDICAL RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS FOR PRIMARY CARE.

     a)   The Contractor may utilize medical residents and fellows as
          participants (but not designated as 'primary care providers') in the
          care of Enrollees as long as all of the following conditions are met:

          i)   Residents/fellows are a part of patient care teams headed by
               fully licensed and Contractor credentialed attending physicians
               serving patients in one or more training sites in an "up
               weighted" or "designated priority" residency program.
               Residents/fellows in a training program which was disapproved as
               a designated priority program solely due to the outcome
               measurement requirement for graduates may be eligible to
               participate in such patient care teams.

          ii)  Only the attending physicians and certified nurse practitioners
               on the training team, not residents/fellows, may be credentialed
               to the Contractor and may be empanelled with Enrollees. Enrollees
               must be assigned an attending physician or certified nurse
               practitioner to act as their PCP, though residents/fellows on the
               team may provide care during all or many of the visits to the
               Enrollee as long as the majority of these visits are under the
               direct supervision of the Enrollee's designated PCP. Enrollees
               have the right to request and receive care by their PCP in
               addition or instead of being seen by a resident or fellow.

          iii) Residents/fellows may work with attending physicians and
               certified nurse practitioners to provide continuity of care to
               patients under the supervision of the patient's PCP. Patients
               must be made aware of the resident/fellow and attending PCP
               relationship and be informed of their rights to be cared for
               directly by their PCP.

          iv)  Residents/fellows eligible to be involved in a continuity
               relationship with patients must be available at least twenty
               percent (20%) of the total training time in the continuity of
               care setting and no less than ten percent (10%) of training time
               in any training year must be in the continuity of care setting
               and no fewer than nine (9) months a year must be spent in the
               continuity of care setting.

          v)   Residents/fellows meeting these criteria provide increased
               capacity for Enrollment to their team according to the formula
               below. Only hours spent routinely scheduled for patient care in
               the continuity of care training site may count as providing
               capacity and are based on 1.0 FTE=40 hours.

PGY-2             750 per FTE

                                       I-2

<PAGE>

          vi)  In order for a resident/fellow to provide continuity of care to
               an Enrollee, both the resident/fellow and the attending PCP must
               have regular hours in the continuity site and must be scheduled
               to be in the site together the majority of the time.

          vii) A preceptor/attending is required to be present a minimum of
               sixteen (16) hours of combined precepting and direct patient care
               in the primary care setting to be counted as a team supervising
               PCP and accept an increased number of Enrollees based upon the
               residents/fellows working on his/her team. Time spent in patient
               care activities at other clinical sites or in other activities
               off-site is not counted towards this requirement.

          viii) A sixteen (16) hour per week attending may have no more than
               four (4) residents/fellows on their team. Attendings spending
               twenty-four (24) hours per week in patient care/supervisory
               activity at the continuity site may have six (6)
               residents/fellows per team. Attendings spending thirty-two (32)
               hours per week may have eight (8) residents/fellows on their
               team. Two (2) or more attendings may join together to form a
               larger team as long as the ratio of attending to
               residents/fellows does not exceed 1:4 and all attendings comply
               with the sixteen (16) hour minimum.

          ix)  Responsibility for the care of the Enrollee remains with the
               attending physician. All attending and resident/fellow teams must
               provide adequate continuity of care, twenty-four (24) hour a day,
               seven (7) days a week coverage, and appointment and availability
               access. Enrollees must be given the name of the responsible
               primary care physician (attending) in writing and be told how he
               or she may contact the attending physician or covering physician,
               if needed.

          x)   Residents/fellows who do not qualify to act as continuity
               providers as part of an attending and resident/fellow team may
               still participate in the episodic care of Enrollees as long as
               that care is under the supervision of an attending physician
               credentialed to the Contractor. Such residents/fellows do not add
               to the capacity of that attending to empanel Enrollees.

          xi)  Certified nurse practitioners and registered physician's
               assistants may not act as attending preceptors for resident
               physicians or fellows.

2.   MEDICAL RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS AS SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS

     a)   Residents/fellows may participate in the specialty care of Enrollees
          in all settings supervised by fully licensed and Contractor
          credentialed specialty attending physicians.

     b)   Only the attending physicians, not residents or fellows, may be
          credentialed by the Contractor. Each attending must be credentialed by
          each MCO with which he or she will participate. Residents/fellows may
          perform all or many of the clinical services for


                                   APPENDIX I
                                 October 1, 2005
                                       I-3

<PAGE>

          the Enrollee as long as these clinical services are under the
          supervision of an appropriately credentialed specialty physician. Even
          when residents/fellows are credentialed by their program in particular
          procedures, certifying their competence to perform and teach those
          procedures, the overall care of each Enrollee remains the
          responsibility of the supervising Contractor credentialed attending.

     c)   The Contractor agrees that although many Enrollees will identify a
          resident or fellow as their specialty provider, the responsibility for
          all clinical decision-making remains ultimately with the attending
          physician of record.

     d)   Enrollees must be given the name of the responsible attending
          physician in writing and be told how they may contact their attending
          physician or covering physician, if needed. This allows Enrollees to
          assist in the communication between their primary care provider and
          specialty attending and enables them to reach the specialty attending
          if an emergency arises in the course of their care. Enrollees must be
          made aware of the resident/fellow and attending relationship and must
          have a right to be cared for directly by the responsible attending
          physician, if requested.

     e)   Enrollees requiring ongoing specialty care must be cared for in a
          continuity of care setting. This requires the ability to make
          follow-up appointments with a particular resident/fellow and attending
          physician team, or if that provider team is not available, with a
          member of the provider's coverage group in order to insure ongoing
          responsibility for the patient by his/her Contractor credentialed
          specialist. The responsible specialist and his/her specialty coverage
          group must be identifiable to the patient as well as to the referring
          primary care provider.

     f)   Attending specialists must be available for emergency consultation and
          care during non-clinic hours. Emergency coverage may be provided by
          residents/fellows under adequate supervision. The attending or a
          member of the attending's coverage group must be available for
          telephone and/or in-person consultation when necessary.

     g)   All training programs participating in the MMC or FHPlus Program must
          be accredited by the appropriate academic accrediting agency.

     h)   All sites in which residents/fellows train must produce legible
          (preferably typewritten) consultation reports. Reports must be
          transmitted such that they are received in a time frame consistent
          with the clinical condition of the patient, the urgency of the problem
          and the need for follow-up by the primary care physician. At a
          minimum, reports should be transmitted so that they are received no
          later than two (2) weeks from the date of the specialty visit.

     i)   Written reports are required at the time of initial consultation and
          again with the receipt of all major significant diagnostic information
          or changes in therapy. In addition, specialists must promptly report
          to the referring primary care physician any significant findings or
          urgent changes in therapy which result from the specialty
          consultation.

3.   TRAINING SITES

     All training sites must deliver the same standard of care to all patients
     irrespective of payor. Training sites must integrate the care of Medicaid,
     FHPlus, uninsured and private patients in the same settings.

           COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

I.   OBJECTIVES

Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) provides that no qualified individual
with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from
participation in or denied access to the benefits of services, programs or
activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such an
entity. Public entities include State and local government and ADA and Section
504 requirements extend to all programs and services provided by State and local
government. Since MMC and FHPlus are government programs, health services
provided through MMC and FHPlus Programs must be accessible to all that qualify
for them.

Contractor responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are imposed under Title
II and Section 504 when, as a Contractor in a MMC or FHPlus Program, a
Contractor is providing a government service. If an individual provider under
contract with the Contractor is not accessible, it is the responsibility of the
Contractor to make arrangements to assure that alternative services are
provided. The Contractor may determine it is expedient to make arrangements with
other providers, or to describe reasonable alternative means and methods to make
these services accessible through its existing Participating Providers. The
goals of compliance with ADA Title II requirements are to offer a level of
services that allows people with disabilities access to the program in its
entirety, and the ability to achieve the same health care results as any
Enrollee.

Contractor responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are also imposed under
Title III when the Contractor functions as a public accommodation providing
services to individuals (e.g. program areas and sites such as Marketing,
education, member services, orientation, Complaints and Appeals). The goals of
compliance with ADA Title III requirements are to offer a level of services that
allows people with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,
facilities or accommodations that the entity provides for its customers or
clients. New and altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible.
Whenever Contractors engage in new construction or renovation, compliance is
also required with accessible design and construction standards promulgated
pursuant to the ADA as well as State and local laws. Title III also requires
that public accommodations undertake "readily achievable barrier removal" in
existing facilities where architectural and communications barriers can be
removed easily and without much difficulty or expense.

The State uses MCO Qualification Standards to qualify MCOs for participation in
the MMC and FHPlus Programs. Pursuant to the State's responsibility to assure
program access to all Enrollees, the Plan Qualification Standards require each
MCO to submit an ADA Compliance Plan that describes in detail how the MCO will
make services, programs and activities readily accessible and useable by
individuals with disabilities. In the event that certain program sites are not

The objectives of these guidelines are threefold:

-    To ensure that Contractors take appropriate steps to measure access and
     assure program accessibility for persons with disabilities;

-    To provide a framework for Contractors as they develop a plan to assure
     compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); and

-    To provide standards for the review of the Contractor Compliance Plans.

These guidelines include a general standard followed by a discussion of specific
considerations and suggestions of methods for assuring compliance. Please be
advised that, although these guidelines and any subsequent reviews by State and
local governments can give the Contractor guidance, it is ultimately the
Contractor's obligation to ensure that it complies with its Contractual
obligations, as well as with the requirements of the ADA, Section 504, and other
federal, state and local laws. Other federal, state and local statutes and
regulations also prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and may
impose requirements in addition to those established under ADA. For example,
while the ADA covers those impairments that "substantially" limit one or more of
the major life activities of an individual, New York City Human Rights Law
deletes the modifier "substantially".

II.  DEFINITIONS

A.   "Auxiliary aids and services" may include qualified interpreters, note
     takers, computer-aided transcription services, written materials, telephone
     handset amplifiers, assistive listening systems, telephones compatible with

     telecommunications devices for Enrollees who are deaf or hard of hearing
     (TTY/TDD), video test displays, and other effective methods of making
     aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing
     impairments; qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, Braille
     materials, large print materials, or other effective methods of making
     visually delivered materials available to individuals with visual
     impairments.

B.   "Disability" means a mental or physical impairment that substantially
     limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual; a record
     of such impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.

III. SCOPE OF CONTRACTOR COMPLIANCE PLAN

The Contractor Compliance Plan must address accessibility to services at
Contractor's program sites, including both Participating Provider sites and
Contractor facilities intended for use by Enrollees.

IV.  PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY

Public programs and services, when viewed in their entirety must be readily
accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities. This standard

discrimination in policies and procedures and communication. Communications with
individuals with disabilities are required to be as effective as communications
with others. The Contractor Compliance Plan must include a detailed description
of how Contractor services, programs, and activities are readily accessible and
usable by individuals with disabilities. In the event that full physical

F.   ADDITIONAL ADA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS

Please note that Title III of the ADA applies to all non-governmental providers
of health care. Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of
goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations of any
place of public accommodation. A public accommodation is a private entity that
owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation. Places
of public accommodation identified by the ADA include, but are not limited to,
stores (including pharmacies) offices (including doctors' offices), hospitals,
health care providers, and social service centers.

New and altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible. Barriers
must be removed from existing facilities when it is readily achievable, defined
by the ADA as easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense. Factors
to be considered when determining if barrier removal is readily achievable
include the cost of the action, the financial resources of the site involved,
and, if applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or
entity. If barrier removal is not readily achievable, the ADA requires alternate
methods of making goods and services available. New facilities must be
accessible unless structurally impracticable.

Title III also requires places of public accommodation to provide any auxiliary
aids and services that are needed to ensure equal access to the services it
offers, unless a fundamental alteration in the nature of services or an undue
burden would result. Auxiliary aids include but are not limited to qualified
sign interpreters, assistive listening systems, readers, large print materials,
etc. Undue burden is defined as "significant difficulty or expense". The factors
to be considered in determining "undue burden" include, but are not limited to,
the nature and cost of the action required and the overall financial resources
of the provider. "Undue burden" is a higher standard than "readily achievable"
in that it requires a greater level of effort on the part of the public
accommodation.

Please note also that the ADA is not the only law applicable for people with
disabilities. In some cases, State or local laws require more than the ADA. For
example, New York City's Human Rights Law, which also prohibits discrimination
against people with disabilities, includes people whose impairments are not as
"substantial" as the narrower ADA and uses the higher "undue burden"
("reasonable") standard where the ADA requires only that which is "readily
achievable". New York City's Building Code does not permit access waivers for
newly

constructed facilities and requires incorporation of access features as existing
facilities are renovated. Finally, the State Hospital code sets a higher
standard than the ADA for provision of communication (such as sign language
interpreters) for services provided at most hospitals, even on an outpatient
basis.

          shall be provided by the Contractor to MMC Enrollees and FHPlus
          Enrollees, respectively, when medically necessary under the terms of

          Program are set forth in the applicable NYS Medicaid Provider Manual,
          except for the Eye Care and Vision benefit for FHPlus Enrollees which

          emergency transportation, Family Planning and Reproductive Health
          services, mental health and chemical dependence assessments (one (1)
          of each per year), court ordered services, and services provided by

               and Family Health Plus Enrollees.

          ii)  K.2 - "Prepaid Benefit Package Definitions Of Covered Services"
               describes the covered services, as numbered in K.1. Each service
               description applies to both MMC and FHPlus Benefit Package unless
               otherwise noted.

          iii) K.3 - "Medicaid Managed Care Definitions of Non-Covered Services"
               describes services that are not covered by the MMC Benefit
               Package. These services are covered by the Medicaid
               fee-for-service program unless otherwise noted.

          iv)  K.4 - "Family Health Plus Non-Covered Services" lists the
               services that are not covered by the FHPlus Benefit Package.

19.  EYE CARE AND LOW VISION SERVICES

     18 NYCRR Section 505.6(b)(1-3)

     SSL Section 369-ee (1)(e)(xii)

     a)   For Medicaid Managed Care only:

          i)   Emergency, preventive and routine eye care services are covered.
               Eye care includes the services of ophthalmologists, optometrists
               and ophthalmic dispensers, and includes eyeglasses, medically
               necessary contact lenses and polycarbonate lenses, artificial
               eyes (stock or custom-made), low vision aids and low vision
               services. Eye care coverage includes the replacement of lost or
               destroyed eyeglasses. The replacement of a complete pair of
               eyeglasses must duplicate the original prescription and frames.
               Coverage also includes the repair or replacement of parts in
               situations where the damage is the result of causes other than
               defective workmanship. Replacement parts must duplicate the
               original prescription and frames. Repairs to, and replacements
               of, frames and/or lenses must be rendered as needed.

          ii)  If the Contractor does not provide upgraded eyeglass frames or
               additional features (such as scratch coating, progressive lenses
               or photo-gray lenses) as part of its covered vision benefit, the
               Contractor cannot apply the cost of its covered eyeglass benefit
               to the total cost of the eyeglasses the Enrollee wants and bill
               only the difference to the Enrollee. The Enrollee can choose to
               purchase the upgraded frames and/or additional features by paying
               the entire cost of the eyeglasses as a private customer. For
               example, if the Contractor covers standard bifocal eyeglasses and
               the Enrollee wants no-line bifocal eyeglasses, the Enrollee must
               choose between taking the standard bifocal eyeglasses or paying
               the full price of the no-line bifocal eyeglasses (not just the
               difference between the cost of the bifocal lenses and the no-line
               lenses). The Enrollee must be informed of this fact by the vision
               care provider at the time that that the glasses are ordered.

          iii) Examinations for diagnosis and treatment for visual defects
               and/or eye disease are provided only as necessary and as required
               by the Enrollee's particular condition. Examinations which
               include refraction are limited to once every twenty four (24)
               months unless otherwise justified as medically necessary.

          iv)  Eyeglasses do not require changing more frequently than once
               every twenty four (24) months unless medically indicated, such as
               a change in correction greater than 1/2 diopter, or unless the
               glasses are lost, damaged, or destroyed.

          v)   An ophthalmic dispenser fills the prescription of an optometrist
               or ophthalmologist and supplies eyeglasses or other vision aids
               upon the order of a qualified practitioner.

          vi)  MMC Enrollees may self-refer to any Participating Provider of
               vision services (optometrist or ophthalmologist) for refractive
               vision services not more frequently than once every twenty four
               (24) months, or if otherwise justified as

               medically necessary or if eyeglasses are lost, damaged or
               destroyed as described above.

     b)   For Family Health Plus only:

          i)   Covered Services include emergency vision care and the following
               preventive and routine vision care provided once in any twenty
               four (24) month period:

               A)   one eye examination;

               B)   either: one pair of prescription eyeglass lenses and a
                    frame, or prescription contact lenses when medically
                    necessary; and

               C)   one pair of medically necessary occupational eyeglasses.

          ii)  An ophthalmic dispenser fills the prescription of an optometrist
               or ophthalmologist and supplies eyeglasses or other vision aids
               upon the order of a qualified practitioner.

          iii) FHPlus Enrollees may self-refer to any Participating Provider of
               vision services (optometrist or ophthalmologist) for refractive
               vision services not more frequently than once every twenty-four
               (24) months.

          iv)  If the Contractor does not provide upgraded frames or additional
               features that the Enrollee wants (such as scratch coating,
               progressive lenses or photo-gray lenses) as part of its covered
               vision benefit, the Contractor cannot apply the cost of its
               covered eyeglass benefit to the total cost of the eyeglasses the
               Enrollee wants and bill only the difference to the Enrollee. The
               Enrollee can choose to purchase the upgraded frames and/or
               additional features by paying the entire cost of the eyeglasses
               as a private customer. For example, if the Contractor covers
               standard bifocal eyeglasses and the Enrollee wants no-line
               bifocal eyeglasses, the Enrollee must choose between taking the
               standard bifocal glasses or paying the full price for the no-line
               bifocal eyeglasses (not just the difference between the cost of
               bifocal lenses and no-line lenses). The Enrollee must be informed
               of this fact by the vision care provider at the time that the
               glasses are ordered.

          v)   Contact lenses are covered only when medically necessary. Contact
               lenses shall not be covered solely because the FHPlus Enrollee
               selects contact lenses in lieu of receiving eyeglasses.

          vi)  Coverage does not include the replacement of lost, damaged or
               destroyed eyeglasses.

          vii) The occupational vision benefit for FHPlus Enrollees covers the
               cost of job-related eyeglasses if that need is determined by a
               Participating Provider through special testing done in
               conjunction with a regular vision examination. Such examination
               shall determine whether a special pair of eyeglasses would
               improve the performance of job-related activities. Occupational
               eyeglasses can be provided in addition to regular glasses but are
               available only in conjunction with a regular vision benefit once
               in any twenty-four (24) month period. FHPlus Enrollees may
               purchase an upgraded frame or lenses for occupational eyeglasses

          i)   screening, related diagnosis, ambulatory treatment, and referral

          coverage or other billing provisions are not addressed until after the

          emergency transportation via 911 or any other emergency call system is
          a covered benefit and the Contractor is responsible for payment.

               Enrollee has a life-threatening or disabling condition or
               disease:

               A)   for which standard health services or procedures have been

                    documents from the available medical and scientific

                  MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PREPAID BENEFIT PACKAGE
                       DEFINITIONS OF NON-COVERED SERVICES

The following services are excluded from the Contractor's Benefit Package, but
are covered, in most instances, by Medicaid fee-for-service:

1.   MEDICAL NON-COVERED SERVICES

     a)   Personal Care Agency Services

          i)   Personal care services (PCS) are the provision of some or total
               assistance with personal hygiene, dressing and feeding; and
               nutritional and environmental support (meal preparation and
               housekeeping). Such services must be essential to the maintenance
               of the Enrollee's health and safety in his or her own home. The
               service has to be ordered by a physician, and there has to be a
               medical need for the service. Licensed home care services
               agencies, as opposed to certified home health agencies, are the
               primary providers of PCS. Enrollee's receiving PCS have to have a
               stable medical condition and are generally expected to be in
               receipt of such services for an extended period of time (years).

          ii)  Services rendered by a personal care agency which are approved by
               the LDSS are not covered under the Benefit Package. Should it be
               medically necessary for the PCP to order personal care agency
               services, the PCP (or the Contractor on the physician's behalf)
               must first contact the Enrollee's LDSS contact person for
               personal care. The district will determine the Enrollee's need
               for personal care agency services and coordinate with the
               personal care agency to develop a plan of care.

     b)   Residential Health Care Facilities (RHCF)

          Services provided in a Residential Health Care Facility (RHCF) to an
          individual who is determined by the LDSS to be in Permanent Status are
          not covered.

     c)   Hospice Program

          i)   Hospice is a coordinated program of home and inpatient care that
               provides non-curative medical and support services for persons
               certified by a physician to be terminally ill with a life
               expectancy of six (6) months or less. Hospice programs provide
               patients and families with palliative and supportive care to meet
               the special needs arising out of physical, psychological,
               spiritual, social and economic stresses which are experienced
               during the final stages of illness and during dying and
               bereavement.

          ii)  Hospices are organizations which must be certified under Article
               40 of the PHL. All services must be provided by qualified
               employees and volunteers of the


                                   APPENDIX K
                                 October 1, 2005
                                      K-25

<PAGE>

               hospice or by qualified staff through contractual arrangements to
               the extent permitted by federal and state requirements. All
               services must be provided according to a written plan of care
               which reflects the changing needs of the patient/family.

          iii) If an Enrollee becomes terminally ill and receives Hospice
               Program services he or she may remain enrolled and continue to
               access the Contractor's Benefit Package while Hospice costs are
               paid for by Medicaid fee-for-service.

     d)   Prescription and Non-Prescription (OTC) Drugs, Medical Supplies, and
          Enteral Formula

          Coverage for drugs dispensed by community pharmacies, over the counter
          drugs, medical/surgical supplies and enteral formula are not included
          in the Benefit Package and will be paid for by Medicaid
          fee-for-service. Medical/surgical supplies are items other than drugs,
          prosthetic or orthotic appliances, or DME which have been ordered by a
          qualified practitioner in the treatment of a specific medical
          condition and which are: consumable, non-reusable, disposable, or for
          a specific rather than incidental purpose, and generally have no
          salvageable value (e.g. gauze pads, bandages and diapers).
          Pharmaceuticals and medical supplies routinely furnished or
          administered as part of a clinic or office visit are covered.

                    meet the needs of a specific target population of chronic
                    alcoholic persons who need a range of services which are
                    different from those typically provided in an alcoholism
                    outpatient clinic. Programs are licensed by as Chemical
                    Dependence Outpatient Rehabilitation Programs under Title 14

                    supports abstinence from chemical dependence (including
                    alcohol and substance abuse) services.

          ii)  Chemical Dependence Services Ordered by the LDSS

               A)   The Contractor is not responsible for the provision and

               therapeutic and remedial in nature, and are medically necessary
               for the maximum reduction of functional and adaptive behavior
               defects associated with the person's mental illness.

          ii)  Family-Based Treatment*

               Rehabilitative services in family-based treatment programs are
               intended to provide treatment to seriously emotionally disturbed
               children and youth to promote their successful functioning and
               integration into the natural family, community, school or
               independent living situations. Such services are provided in
               consideration of a child's developmental stage. Those children
               determined eligible for admission are placed in surrogate family
               homes for care and treatment.

               *These services are certified by OMH under 14 NYCRR Section
               586.3, Part 594 and Part 595.

               disabilities including medical or remedial services recommended
               by a physician or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts
               for a maximum reduction of the effects of physical or mental
               disability and restoration of the person to his or her best
               possible functional level. It also includes the fitting,
               training, and modification of assistive devices by licensed
               practitioners or trained others under their direct supervision.
               Such services are designed to ameliorate or limit the disabling
               condition and to allow the person to remain in or move to, the
               least restrictive residential and/or day setting. These services
               are certified by OMRDD under 14 NYCRR Part 679 (or they are

               with developmental disabilities). If care of this nature is
               provided in facilities other than Article 28 or Article 16
               centers, it is a covered service.

          ii)  Day Treatment

          iii) Medicaid Service Coordination (MSC)

               Medicaid Service Coordination (MSC) is a Medicaid State Plan
               service provided by OMRDD which assists persons with
               developmental disabilities and mental retardation to gain access
               to necessary services and supports appropriate to the needs of
               the needs of the individual. MSC is provided by qualified service
               coordinators and uses a person centered planning process in

               Service Plan (ISP) with and for a person with developmental
               disabilities and mental retardation. MSC promotes the concepts of
               a choice, individualized services and consumer satisfaction. MSC
               is provided by authorized vendors who have a contract with OMRDD,
               and who are paid monthly pursuant to such contract. Persons who
               receive MSC must not permanently reside in an ICF for persons
               with developmental disabilities, a developmental center, a
               skilled nursing facility or any other hospital or Medical
               Assistance institutional setting that provides service
               coordination. They must also not concurrently be enrolled in any
               other comprehensive Medicaid long term service coordination
               program/service including the Care at Home Waiver. Please note:
               See generic definition of Comprehensive Medicaid Case Management
               (CMCM) under Item 3 "Other Non-Covered Services."

          iv)  Home And Community Based Services Waivers (HCBS)

               The Home and Community-Based Services Waiver serves persons with
               developmental disabilities who would otherwise be admitted to an
               ICF/MR if waiver services were not provided. HCBS waivers
               services include residential habilitation, day habilitation,
               prevocational, supported work, respite, adaptive devices,
               consolidated supports and services, environmental modifications,
               family education and training, live-in caregiver, and plan of

               a SSA Section 1915(c) waiver from DHHS.

          v)   Services Provided Through the Care At Home Program (OMRDD)

               The OMRDD Care at Home III, Care at Home IV, and Care at Home VI
               waivers, serve children who would otherwise not be eligible for
               Medicaid because of their parents' income and resources, and who
               would otherwise be eligible for an ICF/MR level of care. Care at
               Home waiver services include service coordination, respite and
               assistive technologies. Care at Home waiver services are
               authorized pursuant to a SSA Section 1915(c) waiver from DHHS.

3.   OTHER NON-COVERED SERVICES

     a)   The Early Intervention Program (EIP) - Children Birth to Two (2) Years
          of Age

          i)   This program provides early intervention services to certain
               children, from birth through two (2) years of age, who have a
               developmental delay or a diagnosed physical or mental condition
               that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay.
               All managed care providers MUST refer infants and toddlers
               suspected of having a delay to the local designated Early
               Intervention agency in their area. (In most municipalities, the
               County Health Department is the designated agency, except: New
               York City - the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; Erie
               County - The Department of Youth Services; Jefferson County -the
               Office of Community Services; and Ulster County - the Department
               of Social Services).

          ii)  Early intervention services provided to this eligible population
               are categorized as Non-Covered. These services, which are
               designed to meet the developmental needs of the child and the
               needs of the family related to enhancing the child's development,
               will be identified on eMedNY by unique rate codes by which only
               the designated early intervention agency can claim reimbursement.
               Contractor covered and authorized services will continue to be
               provided by the Contractor. Consequently, the Contractor, through
               its Participating Providers, will be expected to refer any
               enrolled child suspected of having a developmental delay to the
               locally designated early intervention agency in their area and
               participate in the development of the Child's Individualized
               Family Services Plan (IFSP). Contractor's participation in the
               development of the IFSP is necessary in order to coordinate the
               provision of early intervention services and services covered by
               the Contractor.

          iii) SDOH will instruct the locally designated early intervention
               agencies on how to identify an Enrollee and the need to contact
               the Contractor or the Participating Provider to coordinate
               service provision.

     b)   Preschool Supportive Health Services-Children Three (3) Through Four
          (4) Years of Age

          i)   The Preschool Supportive Health Services Program (PSHSP) enables
               counties and New York City to obtain Medicaid reimbursement for
               certain educationally related medical services provided by
               approved preschool special education programs for young children
               with disabilities. The Committee on Preschool Special Education
               in each school district is responsible for the development of an
               Individualized Education Program (IEP) for each child evaluated
               in need of special education and medically related health
               services.

          ii)  PSHSP services rendered to children three (3) through four (4)
               years of age in conjunction with an approved IEP are categorized
               as Non-Covered.

                                      K-32

<PAGE>

          iii) The PSHSP services will be identified on eMedNY by unique rate
               codes through which only counties and New York City can claim
               reimbursement. In addition, a limited number of Article 28
               clinics associated with approved pre-school programs are allowed
               to directly bill Medicaid fee-for-service for these services.
               Contractor covered and authorized services will continue to be
               provided by the Contractor.

     c)   School Supportive Health Services-Children Five (5) Through Twenty-One
          (21) Years of Age

          i)   The School Supportive Health Services Program (SSHSP) enables
               school districts to obtain Medicaid reimbursement for certain
               educationally related medical services provided by approved
               special education programs for children with disabilities. The
               Committee on Special Education in each school district is
               responsible for the development of an Individualized Education
               Program (IEP) for each child evaluated in need of special
               education and medically related services.

          ii)  SSHSP services rendered to children five (5) through twenty-one
               (21) years of age in conjunction with an approved IEP are
               categorized as Non-Covered.

          iii) The SSHSP services are identified on eMedNY by unique rate codes
               through which only school districts can claim Medicaid
               reimbursement. Contractor covered and authorized services will
               continue to be provided by the Contractor.

     d)   Comprehensive Medicaid Case Management (CMCM)

          A program which provides "social work" case management referral
          services to a targeted population (e.g.: pregnant teens, mentally
          ill). A CMCM case manager will assist a client in accessing necessary
          services in accordance with goals contained in a written case
          management plan. CMCM programs do not provide services directly, but
          refer to a wide range of service Providers. Some of these services
          are: medical, social, psycho-social, education, employment, financial,
          and mental health. CMCM referral to community service agencies and/or
          medical providers requires the case manager to work out a mutually
          agreeable case coordination approach with the agency/medical
          providers. Consequently, if an Enrollee of the Contractor is
          participating in a CMCM program, the Contractor must work
          collaboratively with the CMCM case manager to coordinate the provision
          of services covered by the Contractor. CMCM programs will be
          instructed on how to identify a managed care Enrollee on EMEVS and
          informed on the need to contact the Contractor to coordinate service
          provision.

     e)   Directly Observed Therapy for Tuberculosis Disease

          Tuberculosis directly observed therapy (TB/DOT) is the direct
          observation of oral ingestion of TB medications to assure patient
          compliance with the physician's prescribed medication regimen. While
          the clinical management of tuberculosis is included in the Benefit
          Package, TB/DOT where applicable, can be billed directly to eMedNY by
          any SDOH approved Medicaid fee-for-service TB/DOT Provider. The


                                   APPENDIX K
                                 October 1, 2005
                                      K-33

<PAGE>

          Contractor remains responsible for communicating, cooperating and
          coordinating clinical management of TB with the TB/DOT Provider.

     f)   AIDS Adult Day Health Care

          Adult Day Health Care Programs (ADHCP) are programs designed to assist
          individuals with HIV disease to live more independently in the
          community or eliminate the need for residential health care services.
          Registrants in ADHCP require a greater range of comprehensive health
          care services than can be provided in any single setting, but do not
          require the level of services provided in a residential health care
          setting. Regulations require that a person enrolled in an ADHCP must
          require at least three (3) hours of health care delivered on the basis
          of at least one (1) visit per week. While health care services are
          broadly defined in this setting to include general medical care,
          nursing care, medication management, nutritional services,
          rehabilitative services, and substance abuse and mental health
          services, the latter two (2) cannot be the sole reason for admission
          to the program. Admission criteria must include, at a minimum, the
          need for general medical care and nursing services.

     g)   HIV COBRA Case Management

          The HIV COBRA (Community Follow-up Program) Case Management Program is
          a program that provides intensive, family-centered case management and
          community follow-up activities by case managers, case management
          technicians, and community follow-up workers. Reimbursement is through
          an hourly rate billable to Medicaid. Reimbursable activities include
          intake, assessment, reassessment, service plan development and
          implementation, monitoring, advocacy, crisis intervention, exit
          planning, and case specific supervisory case-review conferencing.

     h)   Adult Day Health Care

          i)   Adult Day Health Care means care and services provided to a
               registrant in a residential health care facility or approved
               extension site under the medical direction of a physician and
               which is provided by personnel of the adult day health care
               program in accordance with a comprehensive assessment of care
               needs and individualized health care plan, ongoing implementation
               and coordination of the health care plan, and transportation.

          ii)  Registrant means a person who is a nonresident of the residential
               health care facility who is functionally impaired and not
               homebound and who requires certain preventive, diagnostic,
               therapeutic, rehabilitative or palliative items or services
               provided by a general hospital, or residential health care
               facility; and whose assessed social and health care needs, in the
               professional judgment of the physician of record, nursing staff,
               Social Services and other professional personnel of the adult day
               health care program can be met in while or in part satisfactorily
               by delivery of appropriate services in such program.

          identified by the Department by written notice.

     b)   This Appendix shall be effective subject to statutory authority to
          conduct Facilitated Enrollment for the MMC and/or FHPlus Program. The
          Contractor agrees to discontinue Facilitated Enrollment activities in

     FHPlus Programs in accordance with the following standards:

     a)   To provide an efficient and cost effective Facilitated Enrollment
          process approved by SDOH, including use of the "train-the-trainer"
          approach.

     b)   To assure that all facilitators participate in the SDOH-sponsored
          training program for the MMC and FHPlus programs to be conducted by a
          private contractor to be selected by SDOH or other training approved
          by SDOH.

     c)   To provide a sufficient number of facilitators at sites accessible and
          convenient to the population being served to assure applicants have
          timely access to Facilitated Enrollment. The Contractor will provide
          SDOH and the LDSS with a list of the fixed Enrollment facilitation
          sites and must update the list on a monthly basis. Subject to SDOH and
          LDSS approval, the Contractor may offer Facilitated Enrollment at
          additional sites not on the list that has already been submitted to
          SDOH and LDSS.

          including facilitators who are able to communicate to vulnerable and
          hard-to-reach populations (e.g., non-English speaking).

     f)   To have mechanisms in place to communicate effectively with applicants

          personal interview is not delegated to the facilitator, one of the
          Contractor's facilitators shall act as the enrollee's authorized
          representative at the personal interview, which will be conducted by
          an LDSS representative with the facilitator.

     h)   To comply with procedures and protocols that have been established by
          the LDSS and approved by SDOH and LDSS pursuant to Medicaid

          applicants obtain required documentation. The Contractor will also

     j)   To educate all applicants that appear to be eligible for Enrollment,
          including adults and families, about managed care and how to access
          benefits in a managed care environment. This will include the
          distribution of SDOH approved material in English and other languages

          insurance coverage. This includes brochures and information developed
          by SDOH to explain health insurance coverage options available through
          FHPlus, CHPlus, and Medicaid Programs and various other public
          programs designed to support self sufficiency.

     k)   To counsel all applicants that appear to be eligible for Enrollment,
          including adult individuals and families regarding selection of a
          participating MCO, and describe the important role of a Primary Care

          Facilitators must help applicants to determine the appropriate MCO to
          select based on their current health care needs and PCP availability.
          The Contractor will ensure that facilitators have information
          available about the providers who participate in each MCO's product
          available in the applicant's LDSS jurisdiction and have established
          procedures for inquiring into existing relationships with health care
          providers in order that the facilitators are able to provide
          assistance with PCP selection and enable applicants to maintain
          existing relationships with providers to the fullest extent possible.

          major software acquisitions, systems modifications or upgrades, etc.,
          that result in a technical method of achieving a practical purpose or

     cannot satisfactorily be performed because of insufficiency of personnel,

          which is likely to or does impair or prejudice the interests of the
          State, the SDOH acting for and on behalf of the State, shall thereupon
          have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving notice in writing
          of the fact and date of such termination to the Contractor, pursuant
          to Section 2 of this Agreement.

8.   Minority And Women Owned Business Policy Statement

     The SDOH recognizes the need to take affirmative action to ensure that
     Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprises are given the opportunity to
     participate in the performance of the SDOH's contracting program. This
     opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by
     traditionally socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential
     to obtain social and economic equality and improve the functioning of the
     State economy.

     It is the intention of the SDOH to provide Minority and Women Owned
     Business Enterprises with equal opportunity to bid on contracts awarded by
     this agency in accordance with the State Finance Law.

9.   Insurance Requirements

     a)   The Contractor must without expense to the State procure and maintain,
          until final acceptance by the SDOH of the work covered by this
          Agreement, insurance of the kinds and in the amounts hereinafter
          provided, by insurance companies authorized to

          under this Agreement, whether performed by it or by subcontractors.
          Before commencing the work, the Contractor shall furnish to the SDOH a
          certificate or certificates, in a form satisfactory to SDOH, showing
          that it has complied with the requirements of this section, which
          certificate or certificates shall state that the policies shall not be
          changed or cancelled until thirty days written notice has been given
          to SDOH. The kinds and amounts of required insurance are:

          i)   A policy covering the obligations of the Contractor in accordance
               with the provisions of Chapter 41, Laws of 1914, as amended,
               known as the Workers' Compensation Law, and the Agreement shall
               be void and of no effect unless the Contractor procures such
               policy and maintains it until acceptance of the work.

          ii)  Policies of Bodily Injury Liability and Property Damage Liability
               Insurance of the types hereinafter specified, each within limits

               for that person, not less than $1,000,000 for all damages arising
               out of bodily injury, including death at any time resulting
               therefrom sustained by two or more persons in any one occurrence,
               and not less than $500,000 for damages arising out of damage to

               A)   Contractor's Liability Insurance issued to and covering the
                    liability of the Contractor with respect to all work

               B)   Automobile Liability Insurance issued to and covering the
                    liability of the People of the State of New York with

                    Contractor or by its subcontractors, including omissions and
                    supervisory acts of the State.

10.  Certification Regarding Debarment and Suspension

     a)   Regulations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
          located at Part 76 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations
          (CFR), implement Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 concerning debarment
          and suspension of participants in Federal program and activities.
          Executive Order 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law,
          Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a government
          wide system for non-procurement debarment and suspension. Executive
          Order 12689 extends the debarment and suspension policy to procurement
          activities of the Federal Government. A person who is debarred or
          suspended by a Federal agency is excluded from Federal financial and
          non-financial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and
          activities, both directly (primary covered transaction) and indirectly
          (lower tier covered transactions). Debarment or suspension by one
          Federal agency has government wide effect.


                                   APPENDIX R
                                 October 1, 2005
                                       R-4

<PAGE>

     b)   Pursuant to the above cited regulations, the SDOH (as a participant in
          a primary covered transaction) may not knowingly do business with a
          person who is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or subject
          to other government wide exclusion (including an exclusion from
          Medicare and State health care program participation on or after
          August 25, 1995), and the SDOH must require its contractors, as lower
          tier participants, to provide the certification as set forth below:

          i)   CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, INELIGIBILITY AND
               VOLUNTARY EXCLUSION-LOWER TIER COVERED TRANSACTIONS

               INSTRUCTIONS FOR CERTIFICATION

               A)   By signing this Agreement, the Contractor, as a lower tier
                    participant, is providing the certification set out below.

               B)   The certification in this clause is a material
                    representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when
                    this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined
                    that the lower tier participant knowingly rendered an
                    erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies
                    available to the Federal Government, the department or
                    agency with which this transaction originated may pursue
                    available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

               C)   The lower tier participant shall provide immediate written
                    notice to the SDOH if at any time the lower tier participant
                    learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted
                    or had become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

               D)   The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended,
                    ineligible, lower tier covered transaction, participant,
                    person, primary covered transaction, principal, proposal,
                    and voluntarily excluded, as used in this clause, have the
                    meaning set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of
                    rules implementing Executive Order 12549. The Contractor may
                    contact the SDOH for assistance in obtaining a copy of those
                    regulations.

               E)   The lower tier participant agrees that it shall not
                    knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with
                    a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR Subpart
                    9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or
                    voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered
                    transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency
                    with which this transaction originated.

               F)   The lower tier participant further agrees that it will
                    include this clause titled "Certification Regarding
                    Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary
                    Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transactions," without
                    modification, in all lower tier covered transactions.


                                   APPENDIX R
                                 October 1, 2005
                                       R-5

<PAGE>

               G)   A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a
                    certification of a participant in a lower tier covered
                    transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48
                    CFR Subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or
                    voluntarily excluded from covered transactions, unless it
                    knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may
                    decide the method and frequency by which it determines the
                    eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is
                    not required to, check the Excluded Parties List System.

               H)   Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to
                    require establishment of a system of records in order to
                    render in good faith the certification required by this
                    clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is
                    not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a
                    prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

               I)   Except for transactions authorized under paragraph E of
                    these instructions, if a participant in a covered
                    transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered
                    transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment
                    under 48 CFR Subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible,
                    or voluntarily excluded from participation in this
                    transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the
                    Federal Government, the department or agency with which this
                    transaction originated may pursue available remedies,
                    including suspension and/or debarment.

          ii)  Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
               Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions

               A)   The lower tier participant certifies, by signing this
                    Agreement, that neither it nor its principals is presently
                    debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared
                    ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in
                    this transaction by any Federal department agency.

               B)   Where the lower tier participant is unable to certify to any
                    of the statements in this certification, such participant
                    shall attach an explanation to this Agreement.

11.  Reports and Publications

     a)   Any materials, articles, papers, etc., developed by the Contractor
          pertaining to the MMC Program or FHPlus Program must be reviewed and
          approved by the SDOH for conformity with the policies and guidelines
          of the SDOH prior to dissemination and/or publication. It is agreed
          that such review will be conducted in an expeditious manner. Should
          the review result in any unresolved disagreements regarding content,
          the Contractor shall be free to publish in scholarly journals along
          with a disclaimer that the views within the Article or the policies
          reflected are not necessarily those of the New York State Department
          of Health.


                                   APPENDIX R

                                       R-6

<PAGE>

     b)   Any publishable or otherwise reproducible material developed under or
          in the course of performing this Agreement, dealing with any aspect of
          performance under this Agreement, or of the results and
          accomplishments attained in such performance, shall be the sole and
          exclusive property of the State, and shall not be published or
          otherwise disseminated by the Contractor to any other party unless
          prior written approval is secured from the SDOH or under circumstances
          as indicated in paragraph (a) above. Any and all net proceeds obtained
          by the Contractor resulting from any such publication shall belong to
          and be paid over to the State. The State shall have a perpetual
          royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce,
          publish or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, any such
          material for governmental purposes.

     c)   No report, document or other data produced in whole or in part with
          the funds provided under this Agreement may be copyrighted by the
          Contractor or any of its employees, nor shall any notice of copyright
          be registered by the Contractor or any of its employees in connection
          with any report, document or other data developed pursuant to this
          Agreement.

     d)   All reports, data sheets, documents, etc. generated under this
          Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive property of the SDOH. Upon
          completion or termination of this Agreement the Contractor shall
          deliver to the SDOH upon its demand all copies of materials relating
          to or pertaining to this Agreement. The Contractor shall have no right
          to disclose or use any of such material and documentation for any
          purpose whatsoever, without the prior written approval of the SDOH or
          its authorized agents.

     e)   The Contractor, its officers, agents and employees and subcontractors
          shall treat all information, which is obtained by it through its
          performance under this Agreement, as confidential information to the
          extent required by the laws and regulations of the United States and
          laws and regulations of the State of New York.

12.  Provisions Related to New York State Executive Order Number 127

     a)   If applicable, the Contractor certifies that all information provided
          to the State with respect to New York State Executive Order Number
          127, signed by Governor Pataki on June 16, 2003, is complete, true,
          and accurate.

     b)   The State reserves the right to terminate this Agreement in the event
          it is found that the certification filed by the Contractor, in
          accordance with New York State Executive Order Number 127, was
          intentionally false or intentionally incomplete. Upon such finding,
          the State may exercise its termination right by providing written
          notification to the Contractor in accordance with the written
          notification terms of this Agreement.
