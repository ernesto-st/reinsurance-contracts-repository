upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3 unless such
Issuing Bank shall have notified the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) on or prior to the date for notice of termination set forth in such
Letter of Credit (but in any event at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to
the date of automatic renewal) of its election not to renew such Standby Letter
of Credit (a "NOTICE OF TERMINATION"); PROVIDED that the terms of each Standby
Letter of Credit that is automatically renewable annually shall not permit the
expiration date (after giving effect to any renewal) of such Standby Letter of
Credit in any event to be extended to a date later than sixty (60) days before
the Revolving Credit Termination Date. If either a Notice of Renewal is not
given by the Borrower or a Notice of Termination is given by the Issuing Bank
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such Standby Letter of Credit
shall expire on the date on which it otherwise would have been automatically
renewed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that even in the absence of receipt of a Notice of
Renewal, the Issuing Bank may, in its discretion unless instructed to the
contrary by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, deem that a Notice of
Renewal had been timely delivered and, in such case, a Notice of Renewal shall
be deemed to have been so delivered for all purposes under this Agreement.
Within the limits of the Letter of Credit Facility, and subject to the limits
referred to above, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit
under this Section 2.1(d), repay any Letter of Credit Advances resulting from
drawings under Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and request the
issuance of additional Letters of Credit under this Section 2.1(d).

      Section 2.2 MAKING THE ADVANCES. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.3 or, with respect to Swing Line Advances, in Section 2.2(b), each
Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in
the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances and on the first Business Day prior to the
date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of Prime Rate Advances by


                                       -32-
<Page>

the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each appropriate
Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each such notice of a
Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") may be by telephone, confirmed immediately
in writing, or telex or telecopier in substantially the form of EXHIBIT G
hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii)
Facility under which such Borrowing is to be made, (iii) Type of Advances
comprising such Borrowing, (iv) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and (v) in
the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest
Period for each such Advance. Each appropriate Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M.
(New York time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of
its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing in accordance with the respective Commitments under the applicable
Facility of such Lender and the other appropriate Lenders. After the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, the Administrative Agent will make
such funds available to the Borrower by crediting the Borrower's Account;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall first make a portion of such funds equal to the
aggregate principal amount of any Swing Line Advances and Letter of Credit
Advances made by the Swing Line Bank, the Issuing Bank and by any other
Revolving Credit Lender and outstanding on the date of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing, PLUS interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date,
available to the Swing Line Bank, the Issuing Bank and such other Revolving
Credit Lenders for repayment of such Swing Line Advances and Letter of Credit
Advances.

            (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made either (x) on notice,
given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the date of the proposed
Swing Line Borrowing, by the Borrower to the Swing Line Bank and the
Administrative Agent or (y) pursuant to other arrangements, including, by way of
example and not of limitation, arrangements for daily repayments and borrowings
on each Business Day, which are satisfactory in form and substance to the Swing
Line Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Each notice of a Swing
Line Borrowing pursuant to clause (x) in the immediately preceding sentence (a
"NOTICE OF SWING LINE BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately
in writing, or telex or telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of
such Borrowing, (ii) amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such
Borrowing (which maturity shall be no later than the fourteenth day after the
requested date of such Borrowing). If, in its discretion, it elects to make a
requested Swing Line Advance, the Swing Line Bank will make the amount thereof
available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in
same day funds. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by crediting
the Borrower's Account. Upon written demand by the Swing Line Bank, with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each other Revolving Credit Lender
shall purchase from the Swing Line Bank, and the Swing Line Bank shall sell and
assign to each such other Revolving Credit Lender, such other Lender's Pro Rata
Share of all outstanding Swing Line Advances as of the date of such demand, by
deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount
equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of Swing Line Advances
to be purchased by such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and
assignment. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share


                                       -33-
<Page>

of outstanding Swing Line Advances on (i) the Business Day on which demand
therefor is made by the Swing Line Bank; PROVIDED that notice of such demand is
given not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the
first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given
after such time. Upon any such assignment by the Swing Line Bank to any other
Revolving Credit Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, the Swing Line
Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that the Swing Line Bank is
the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes
no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the
extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Swing Line Advance available to the Administrative Agent, such Revolving
Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Swing Line Bank, forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date of demand by the Swing Line Bank until the date such
amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the
Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal
shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day
for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the
Swing Line Advance made by the Swing Line Bank shall be reduced by such amount
on such Business Day.

            (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances if the
obligation of the appropriate Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall
then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.9 or Section 2.10, and (ii) the
Eurodollar Rate Advances made on any date may not be outstanding as part of more
than seven (7) separate Borrowings.

            (d) Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line Borrowing
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing
that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar
Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each appropriate Lender against any
loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by the
Borrower to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing
for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3, including,
without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits as
reasonably determined by such Lender), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when
such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

            (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
an appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing under a Facility under
which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make available to
the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.2 and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so
made such ratable


                                       -34-
<Page>

portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower
severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable at such time under Section 2.7 to Advances
comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds
Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding
amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of
such Borrowing for all purposes.

            (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it
as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation,
if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

      Section 2.3 ISSUANCE OF AND DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENT UNDER LETTERS OF
CREDIT.

            (a) REQUEST FOR ISSUANCE. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon
notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the fifth Business
Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of Credit by the
Borrower to the Issuing Bank, which shall give to the Administrative Agent and
each Revolving Credit Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each
such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF ISSUANCE") shall be
by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier,
specifying therein the requested (i) date of such issuance (which shall be a
Business Day), (ii) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (iii) expiration
date of such Letter of Credit, (iv) name and address of the beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit, and (v) form of such Letter of Credit and shall be accompanied
by such application and agreement for letter of credit as the Issuing Bank may
specify to the Borrower for use in connection with such requested Letter of
Credit (a "LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENT"). If the requested form of such Letter of
Credit is acceptable to the Issuing Bank, in its sole discretion, the Issuing
Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3,
make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower at its office referred to
in Section 11.2 or as otherwise agreed with the Borrower in connection with such
issuance. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any such Letter
of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this
Agreement shall govern.

            (b) LETTER OF CREDIT REPORTS. The Issuing Bank shall furnish (i) to
the Administrative Agent on the first Business Day of each fiscal quarter a
written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit
issued during the previous week and drawings during such week under all Letters
of Credit, (ii) to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Revolving
Credit Lender on the first Business Day of each month a written report
summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued during the
preceding month and drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit and
(iii) to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Revolving Credit Lender
on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting
forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during the preceding calendar
quarter of all Letters of Credit.

            (c) DRAWING AND REIMBURSEMENT. The payment by the Issuing Bank of a
draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement the making by the Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance which
shall be a Prime Rate Advance in the amount of such draft. The Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender hereby acknowledges and
agrees that Letter of Credit Advances may be made, or deemed made, by the
Issuing Bank in respect of any Letter of Credit and to participate in all Letter
of Credit Advances made hereunder as provided herein. Upon written demand by the
Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each
Revolving Credit Lender shall purchase from the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing
Bank shall sell and assign to each such Revolving Credit Lender such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Letter of Credit Advance as of the date of
such purchase, by making available (for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office) to the Administrative Agent (for the account of the Issuing Bank), by
deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds in U.S.
Dollars, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of
such Letter of Credit Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Promptly after
receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent shall transfer such funds to the
Issuing Bank. The Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding
Letter of Credit Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is
made by the Issuing Bank; PROVIDED that notice of such demand is given not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business
Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such
time. Upon any such assignment by the Issuing Bank to any other Revolving Credit
Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance the Issuing Bank represents
and warrants to such other Lender that the Issuing Bank is the legal and
beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, free and clear of any
liens, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents
or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall
not have so made the amount of such Letter of Credit Advance available to the
Administrative Agent, such Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the Issuing Bank until the date
such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for
its account or the account of the Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the Issuing
Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall
constitute a Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day
for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the
Letter of Credit Advance made by the Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such
amount on such Business Day.

            (d) FAILURE TO MAKE LETTER OF CREDIT ADVANCES. The failure of any
Lender to make any Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date
specified in Section 2.3(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation
hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Letter of Credit
Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

2.5(b)(ii)) until such Revolving Credit Advances are paid in full; and FIFTH,
deposited in the L/C Cash Collateral Account to cash collateralize 100% of the
Available Amount of the Letters of Credit then outstanding. Upon the drawing of
any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or the
Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable.

            (b)   MANDATORY.

                  (i) Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Fiscal
      Year in which the ratio of Consolidated Debt to EBITDA at the end of such
      Fiscal Year is greater than or equal to 1.50:1, the Borrower shall execute
      and deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower's
      President or a Vice President demonstrating its calculation of Excess Cash
      Flow for such Fiscal Year along with a prepayment of the then outstanding
      Advances equal to fifty percent (50%) of the annual Excess Cash Flow.

                  (ii) If the ratio of Consolidated Debt to EBITDA for the
      Borrower's most recently completed and reported on four fiscal quarters is
      greater than or equal to 1.50:1, within fifteen (15) days after receipt by
      any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from Asset
      Dispositions, the Borrower shall prepay the then outstanding Advances in
      an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash Proceeds in
      excess of $250,000.00 in any Fiscal Year.

                  (iii) If the ratio of Consolidated Debt to EBITDA for the
      Borrower's most recently completed and reported on four fiscal quarters is
      greater than or equal to 1.50:1, within fifteen (15) days after receipt by
      any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from any
      Debt Issuance or Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the then
      outstanding Advances in an amount equal to, with respect to any (x) Debt
      Issuance, one-hundred percent (100%), and (y) Equity Issuance, one-hundred
      percent (100%), of such Net Cash Proceeds.

                  (iv) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Net Cash
      Proceeds by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries from any
      Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid to or for the account of any
      Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries and not otherwise included in clause
      (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Borrower shall prepay the then outstanding
      Advances in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such Net Cash
      Proceeds in excess of $100,000.00 in the aggregate.

                  (v) Each prepayment made by the Borrower pursuant to clause
      (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall be subject to the provisions of Section
      11.4(c) and shall be applied to prepay the Facilities in the following
      manner: FIRST, ratably to the Term A Facility, and ratably, in proportion
      to the total principal amount of the Term A Facility then outstanding, to
      each unpaid installment of principal of the Term A Facility until such
      installments are paid in full; SECOND, to prepay Swing Line Advances then
      outstanding until such Advances are paid in full; THIRD, to prepay Letter
      of Credit Advances then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full;
      FOURTH, to prepay Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding (whereupon
      the Revolving Credit Facility shall be permanently reduced as set forth in
      Section 2.5(b)(ii) in the amount of such prepayment) until such Revolving
      Credit Advances are paid in full; and FIFTH, deposited in the L/C Cash
      Collateral Account to cash collateralize 100% of the Available Amount of
      the Letters of Credit then outstanding. The portion of each such
      application allocable to Eurodollar Rate Advances may, at the option of
      the Borrower (A) be applied to repay such Advances immediately, even if
      such application shall occur on other than the last day of an applicable
      Interest Period (in which case the Borrower shall pay the amounts provided
      for in Section 11.4(c)) or (B) be deposited in the Prepayment Account and
      applied on the last day of the applicable Interest Periods to prepay the
      Eurodollar Rate Advances that would otherwise have been prepaid by the
      amounts deposited in the Prepayment Account. Upon the drawing of any
      Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral
      Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or the
      Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable. The amount remaining (if any)
      after the required prepayment of the Advances then outstanding and the
      100% cash collateralization of the aggregate Available Amount of Letters
      of Credit then outstanding (the sum of such prepayment amounts, cash
      collateralization amounts and remaining amount being referred to herein as
      the "REDUCTION AMOUNT") may be retained by the Borrower. Upon the drawing
      of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash
      Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing
      Bank or the Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable. Upon the termination
      of all of the Commitments and the indefeasible payment in full of all
      Obligations, including, without limitation, termination or expiration of
      all Letters of Credit, and the indefeasible payment in full of all
      Obligations in respect of all Letters of Credit, as applicable, then all
      amounts remaining on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account shall be
      returned to the Borrower.

                  (vi) The Borrower shall, within fifteen (15) days following
      the end of each month in each Fiscal Year, pay to the Administrative Agent
      for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account an amount sufficient to
      cause the aggregate amount on deposit


                                      -41-
<Page>

      in such Account to equal the amount by which the aggregate Available
      Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the Letter of
      Credit Facility on such Business Day.

                  (vii) At any time that the aggregate amount of Revolving
      Credit Advances outstanding exceeds the Revolving Credit Availability, the
      Borrower shall immediately repay Revolving Credit Advances to the extent
      necessary to reduce the principal balance of Revolving Credit Borrowings
      to an amount equal to or less than the Revolving Credit Availability..

                  (viii) The foregoing notwithstanding, the provisions of this
      Section 2.6(b) shall not be construed to permit any Equity Issuance, Debt
      Issuance or Asset Disposition otherwise prohibited under the terms of this
      Agreement.

      Section 2.7 INTEREST.

            (a) SCHEDULED INTEREST. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each Advance owing to each Lender from the date of such Advance until such
principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

                  (i) PRIME RATE ADVANCES. During such periods as such Advance
      is a Prime Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of
      (x) the Prime Rate in effect from time to time PLUS (y) the Applicable
      Margin for such Advance in effect from time to time, payable in arrears
      monthly on the last day of each month during such periods and on the date
      such Prime Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

                  (ii) EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES. During such periods as such
      Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times
      during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the
      Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance PLUS (y) the
      Applicable Margin for such Advance in effect on the first day of such
      Interest Period, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest
      Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three
      months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three
      months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such
      Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

            (b) DEFAULT INTEREST. (i) With respect to any principal amount of
any Advance not paid when due by the Borrower (whether at the stated maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise), the Borrower shall pay interest on such unpaid
principal amount, in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or
(a)(ii) above and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the
lesser of 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such
Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above or to the fullest extent
permitted by law (the "Default Rate") and (ii) with respect to the amount of any
interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder not paid when due (whether at
the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) the Borrower shall pay
interest on such unpaid interest, fee or other amount on demand at the Default
Rate from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in
full.


                                      -42-
<Page>

            (c) NOTICE OF INTEREST RATE. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2(a), the Administrative Agent shall give notice
to the Borrowers and each appropriate Lender of the applicable interest rate
determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of clause (a)(i) or (ii) of
this Section 2.7.

      Section 2.8 FEES.

            (a) COMMITMENT FEES. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Lenders, commitment fees, from the Closing Date in
the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of
each other Lender, until the Revolving Credit Termination Date, payable in
arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing September 30, 2001, and on the Revolving Credit Termination
Date on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender at a
rate per annum equal to the percentage per annum determined pursuant to the last
paragraph of this Section 2.8(a) by reference to the ratio of Consolidated Debt
to EBITDA at such time, as set forth below:

<Table>
<Caption>
Consolidated Debt
to EBITDA Ratio                                      Commitment Fee
------------------                                   --------------
<S>                                                  <C>
Greater than 2.0 to 1.0                                   .50%

Greater than 1.75 to 1.0                                  .50%
but less than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0

Greater than 1.50 to 1.0                                  .40%
but less than or equal to 1.75 to 1.0

Greater than 1.00 to 1.0                                  .35%
but less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.0

Equal to or Less than 1.0 to 1.0                          .30%
</Table>

The ratio of Consolidated Debt to EBITDA shall be determined in the same manner
as is the Applicable Margin. For purposes of this subsection (a), Swing Line
Advances shall only constitute utilization of the Revolving Credit Commitment of
the Swingline Bank or of any Revolving Lender actually funding such Swingline
Advance and shall not constitute utilization of the Revolving Credit Commitments
of the Revolving Credit Lenders who have no outstanding Swingline Advances.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date which is six months from the
date hereof the rate per annum on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit
Commitment of such Lender shall be equal to .50%.

            (b) LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a
commission, payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing


                                      -43-
<Page>

September 30, 2001, and on the earliest to occur of the full drawing,
expiration, termination or cancellation of any such Letter of Credit and on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date or on such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
average daily aggregate Available Amount during such quarter of all Letters of
Credit outstanding from time to time at the rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Margin then in effect for Eurodollar Advances under the Revolving
Credit Facility.

                  (ii) In addition to the foregoing fees described in (i) above,
      the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Bank, for its own account, (x) on
      the Available Amount of each Letter of Credit, a fronting fee, for the
      period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including
      the termination thereof, computed at the rate of one quarter of one
      percent (1/4%) per annum, payable in arrears quarterly on the last
      Business Day of each March, June, September and December of each year and
      on the date of termination thereof and (y) transfer fees and other
      customary fees and charges in connection with the issuance or
      administration of each Letter of Credit as the Borrower and the Issuing
      Bank shall agree.

            (c)   ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S FEES.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time
be agreed in writing between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

      Section 2.9 CONVERSION OF ADVANCES.

            (a) OPTIONAL. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice
given to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on
the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject
to the provisions of Sections 2.7 and 2.10, Convert all or any portion of the
Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other
Type; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into
Prime Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Advances unless the Borrower pays the amounts, if any,
provided for in Section 11.4(c), any Conversion of Prime Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount
specified in Section 2.1(c), no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more
separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.2(c) and each Conversion of
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing under any Facility shall be made
ratably among the appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments under
such Facility. Each such notice of Conversion shall, within the restrictions
specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to
be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
duration of the initial Interest Period for such Advances. Each notice of
Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

            (b) MANDATORY. (i) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $500,000.00, such
Advances shall automatically Convert into Prime Rate Advances.

                  (ii) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
      Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
      provisions contained in


                                      -44-
<Page>

      the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.1, the Administrative
      Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the appropriate Lenders,
      whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
      last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a
      Prime Rate Advance.

                  (iii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
      Event of Default and the acceleration of the Notes, interest thereon and
      other amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other
      Loan Documents pursuant to Article 9, (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance
      will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
      therefor, Convert into a Prime Rate Advance and (y) the obligation of the
      Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances
      shall be suspended.

      Section 2.10      INCREASED COSTS, ETC.

            (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in
reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage, or in
the interpretation of any law or regulation, or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or of making, funding or
maintaining Eurodollar Rate or Prime Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of
issuing or maintaining Letters of Credit or of agreeing to make or of making or
maintaining Letter of Credit Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section
2.10 any such increased costs resulting from (x) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to
which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (y) changes in the basis of taxation of
overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the
foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender Party is
organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision
thereof), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender
Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that a Lender Party claiming additional amounts under this Section
2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy
and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable
Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would
not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender Party. A certificate as to the amount of such
increased cost, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party, shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

            (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
amount of capital required or reasonably expected to be maintained by any Lender
Party or any corporation controlling such Lender Party as a result of or based
upon the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue Letters
of Credit hereunder and other commitments of such type or the issuance or
maintenance of the Letters of


                                      -45-
<Page>

Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender
Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party, from
time to time as specified by such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender Party in the light of such circumstances, to the extent
that such Lender Party reasonably determines such increase in capital to be
allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue
Letters of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of any Letters of
Credit. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower by such
Lender Party shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

            (c) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances under any
Facility, Lenders owed greater than 50% of the then aggregate unpaid principal
amount thereof notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such
Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrower and the appropriate Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar Rate
Advance under any Facility will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Prime Rate Advance and (ii)
the obligation of the appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Borrower that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder,
then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower
through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance under each
Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment will automatically, upon such
demand, Convert into a Prime Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the
appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that before making any such
demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations
to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to find or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

      Section 2.11 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

            (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the
Notes, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise
provided in Section 2.15), not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the day
when due in U.S. dollars to the


                                      -46-
<Page>

Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account in same day funds.
The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to be
distributed (i) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of principal,
interest, commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and
under the Notes to more than one Lender Party, to such Lender Parties for the
account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance
with the amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to such Lender
Parties and (ii) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of any Obligation
then payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such Lender Party for the account
of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance
and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 11.7(d), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under
the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender Party
assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall
make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.

            (b) If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to
the Obligations under the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan
Documents do not specify the Advances or the Facility to which, or the manner in
which, such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such funds to each Lender Party ratably in accordance with such Lender Party's
proportionate share of the principal amount of all outstanding Advances and the
Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding in repayment or
prepayment of such of the outstanding Advances or other Obligations owed to such
Lender Party, and for application to such principal installments, as the
Administrative Agent shall direct.

            (c) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder or, in
the case of a Lender, under the Note held by such Lender, to charge from time to
time against any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party any
amount so due.

            (d) All Prime Rate Advances shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed in the period during which interest accrues and a
year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and all Eurodollar Rate Advances shall
be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period
during which interest accrues and a year of 360 days. All computations of
interest, fees, and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days (or in the case of Prime
Rate Advances 365 or 366, as applicable), in each case for the actual number of
days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

            (e) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of


                                      -47-
<Page>

payment of interest or commitment fee, as the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of
Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such
payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

            (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender Party
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If
and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to
the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

      Section 2.12 TAXES.

            (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder or under the
Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding, in the case of each Lender Party and the Administrative Agent, net
income taxes that are imposed by the United States and net income taxes (or
franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) that are imposed on such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws
of which such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender
Party, net income taxes (or franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) that are
imposed on such Lender Party by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender
Party's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being
hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall
be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.12) such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp,
documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise
from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, performing


                                      -48-
<Page>

under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter
referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

            (c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party and the
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for the
full amount of taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.12, imposed on or paid by such Lender Party or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to
tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, except
with respect to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, for such a liability arising from such Lender Party's or the Administrative
Agent's, as the case may be, willful misconduct or gross negligence. This
indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date such Lender
Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor.

            (d) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred
to in Section 11.2, the original receipt of payment thereof or a certified copy
of such receipt. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or
on behalf of the Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States
or by or on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a United States
person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof,
the Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the
Administrative Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the
Administrative Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For
purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "UNITED STATES"
and "UNITED STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

            (e) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender or Initial Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which it became a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender
Party, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent (but only so long thereafter as such Lender Party
remains lawfully able to do so), provide each of the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower with two (2) original Internal Revenue Service forms W8BEN or
W8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a
reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this
Agreement or the Notes. If the forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such
Lender Party first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States
interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate
shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party
provides the appropriate form certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods governed by such form; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if at the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party
to this Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under
subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes


                                      -49-
<Page>

shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the
future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding
tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date.
If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the
disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax
payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service
form 1001 or 4224, that the Lender Party reasonably considers to be
confidential, the Lender Party shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and
shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential
information.

            (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has failed
to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in subsection (e)
(other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring after the date
on which a form originally was required to be provided or if such form otherwise
is not required under subsection (e)), such Lender Party shall not be entitled
to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by
the United States by reason of such failure; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that should a
Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender Party
shall reasonably request to assist such Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

            (g) Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

      Section 2.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If any Lender Party shall obtain at
any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of set-off, or otherwise) (i) on account of Obligations due and
payable to such Lender Party hereunder or under the Notes at such time in excess
of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount of such
Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to (y) the
aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties
hereunder and under the Notes at such time) of payments on account of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder or under the Notes
at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such time or (ii) on account
of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder
and under the Notes at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to
the proportion of (x) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party
at such time to (y) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due
and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time)
of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the
Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the
other Lender Parties such participations in the Obligations due and payable or
owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each
other Lender


                                      -50-
<Page>

Party shall be rescinded and each such other Lender Party shall repay to the
purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such Lender Party's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the purchase price paid to
such Lender Party to (y) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lender
Parties) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender Party's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount of such other
Lender Party's required repayment to (y) the total amount of such required
repayments to the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid
or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so
recovered.

The Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing a participation from
another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender Party
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

      Section 2.14 USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Advances and issuances
of Letters of Credit shall be available, and the Borrower shall use such
proceeds and Letters of Credit solely (a) to finance, in part, the Merger, to
pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, (b) to repay
existing indebtedness and (c) to finance working capital and capital
expenditures of the Borrower.

      Section 2.15 DEFAULTING LENDERS. (a) In the event that, at any one time,
(i) any Lender Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender
shall owe a Defaulted Advance to the Borrower and (iii) the Borrower shall be
required to make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or
for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, so long as no
Default shall occur or be continuing at such time and to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, set off and otherwise apply the obligation of the
Borrower to make such payment to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender
against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted Advance.
In the event that, on any date, the Borrower shall so set off and otherwise
apply its obligation to make any such payment against the obligation of such
Defaulting Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such date,
the amount so set off and otherwise applied by the Borrower shall constitute for
all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents an Advance by such
Defaulting Lender made on the date under the Facility pursuant to which such
Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made pursuant to Section
2.1. Such Advance shall be a Prime Rate Advance and shall be considered, for all
purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the Borrowing in connection with
which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made pursuant
to Section 2.1, even if the other Advances comprising such Borrowing shall be
Eurodollar Rate Advances on the date such Advance is deemed to be made pursuant
to this subsection (a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent at
any time the Borrower exercises its right of set-off pursuant to this subsection
(a) and shall set forth in such notice (i) the name of the Defaulting Lender and
the Defaulted Advance required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and (ii) the
amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of such Defaulted Advance
pursuant to this subsection (a). Any portion of such payment otherwise required
to be made by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender which
is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the amount set off and otherwise
applied by the Borrower


                                      -51-
<Page>

pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as
specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.15.

            (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party shall
be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount
to the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender Parties and (iii) the
Borrower shall make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the
Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such other Lender
Parties and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply at such
time the amount so paid by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender to the payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to
pay such Defaulted Amount. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall so
apply any such amount to the payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date,
the amount so applied by the Administrative Agent shall constitute for all
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, payment, to such
extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount so applied by the
Administrative Agent shall be retained by the Administrative Agent or
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such other Lender Parties, ratably in
accordance with the respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at
such time to the Administrative Agent and such other Lender Parties and, if the
amount of such payment made by the Borrower shall at such time be insufficient
to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the Administrative Agent and
the other Lender Parties, in the following order of priority:

                  (i) FIRST, to the Administrative Agent for any Defaulted
      Amount then owing to the Administrative Agent; and

                  (ii) SECOND, to the Lender Parties for any Defaulted Amounts
      then owing to such Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with such
      respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such Lender Parties.

Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of this Section 2.15.

            (c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party shall
be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a Defaulted
Advance or a Defaulted Amount and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender Party shall be required to pay or distribute any amount
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such
Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower or such other Lender Party shall pay such
amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in escrow or the Administrative
Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow
such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the Administrative Agent in
escrow under this subsection (c) shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent
in an account with Fleet, in the name and under the control of the
Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this subsection (c). The
terms applicable


                                      -52-
<Page>

to such account, including the rate of interest payable with respect to the
credit balance of such account from time to time, shall be Fleet's standard
terms applicable to escrow accounts maintained with it. Any interest credited to
such account from time to time shall be held by the Administrative Agent in
escrow under, and applied by the Administrative Agent from time to time in
accordance with the provisions of, this subsection (c). The Administrative Agent
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so
held in escrow from time to time to the extent necessary to make any Advances
required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and to pay any amount payable by
such Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party, as and when such Advances or
amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the amount so held in escrow
shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all such Advances and amounts
required to be made or paid at such time, in the following order of priority:

                  (i) FIRST, to the Administrative Agent for any amount then due
      and payable by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent
      hereunder;

                  (ii) SECOND, to the Lender Parties for any amount then due and
      payable by such Defaulting Lender to such Lender Parties hereunder,
      ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable to
      such Lender Parties; and

                  (iii) THIRD, to the Borrower for any Advance then required to
      be made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment of such
      Defaulting Lender.

In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any
time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender Party shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party and applied by such
Lender Party to the Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in such manner as the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably direct.

            (d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this
Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower may
have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Advance and
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party may have against such
Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

      Section 2.16 REMOVAL OF LENDER. In the event that any Lender Party (an
"AFFECTED LENDER") (a) demands payment of costs or additional amounts pursuant
to Section 2.10 or Section 2.12 or (b) asserts, pursuant to Section 2.10(d) that
it is unlawful for such Affected Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances, then
(subject to such Affected Lender's right to rescind such demand or assertion
within 10 days after the notice from the Borrower referred to below), so long as
no Event of Default exists the Borrower may, upon 20 days' prior express written
notice to such Affected Lender and the Administrative Agent, with the reasonable
assistance of the Administrative Agent, elect to cause such Affected Lender to
assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to
it and the Note or Notes held by it) to an Eligible


                                      -53-
<Page>

Assignee selected by the Borrower which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, so long as such Affected Lender receives payment in full
in immediately available funds of the outstanding principal amount of all
Advances made by it and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other
amounts due and payable to such Affected Lender as of the effective date of such
assignment (including, without limitation, amounts owing to such Affected Lender
pursuant to Section 2.3, 2.4, 2.7, 2.8, 2.10 or 2.12) and in such case such
Affected Lender agrees to make such assignment, and such assignee shall agree to
accept such assignment and assume all the obligations of such Affected Lender
hereunder, in accordance with Section 11.7. Until the consummation of an
assignment in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.16, the
Borrower shall continue to pay to the Affected Lender any Obligations as they
become due and payable.

immediately deposit all payments made for Inventory or other payments
constituting proceeds of Collateral in the identical form in which such payment

any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower and (C)
pursue any and all rights and remedies available under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents.

If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders,
irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Article 9
or otherwise, make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith upon such demand
the Borrower will, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lender
Parties in same day funds at the Administrative Agent's office designated in
such demand, for deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to
the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding. If at
any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held in the L/C Cash
Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than
the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties or that the total amount of such
funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the
Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the
Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C
Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate
Available Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the
L/C Cash Collateral Account that the Administrative Agent determines to be free
and clear of any such right and claim.


                                    ARTICLE X
                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

      Section 10.1 AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION. Each Lender Party (in its
capacities as a Lender, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank and any Hedge
Bank) hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers
and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all holders of Notes;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take
any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or applicable law. The
Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each
notice and other material information given to it by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall not be a trustee or
fiduciary for any Lender.

      Section 10.2 AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with
the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof
until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance
entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an
Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 11.7; (b) may consult
with legal counsel (including counsel for any Loan


                                       -92-
<Page>

Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender Party and shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with the Loan
Documents; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any
Loan Document on the part of any Loan Party or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (e) shall not be
responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no liability under or
in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate
or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

      Section 10.3 FLEET AND AFFILIATES. With respect to its Commitments, the
Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, Fleet shall have the same rights
and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender Party and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term "Lender
Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include
Fleet in its individual capacity. Fleet and its affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment
banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, any
Loan Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or
own securities of any Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if Fleet were
not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lender Parties.

      Section 10.4 LENDER PARTY CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender Party acknowledges
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or
any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.6 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement.

      Section 10.5 INDEMNIFICATION.

            (a) Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower)
from and against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided
below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of any of the Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under any
of the Loan Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that


                                       -93-
<Page>

no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender Party agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 11.4, to the
extent that the Administrative Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs
and expenses by the Borrower.

            (b) Each Lender Party severally agrees to indemnify the Issuing Bank
(to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such
Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Issuing Bank in any way
relating to or arising out of any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or
omitted by the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party
agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
counsel) payable by the Borrower under Section 11.4, to the extent that the
Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the
Borrower.

            (c) For purposes of Sections 10.5(a) and 10.5(b), the Lender
Parties' respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any
time, according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender Parties, (ii) their
respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding at such time, (iii) the aggregate unused portions of their
respective Term A Commitments at such time, and (iv) their respective Unused
Revolving Credit Commitments at such time; PROVIDED, that the aggregate
principal amount of Swing Line Advances owing to the Swing Line Bank and Letter
of Credit Advances owing to the Issuing Bank shall be considered to be owed to
the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
Revolving Credit Commitments. In the event that any Defaulted Advance shall be
owing by any Defaulting Lender at any time, such Lender Party's Commitment with
respect to the Facility under which such Defaulted Advance was required to have
been made shall be considered to be unused for purposes of this Section 10.5 to
the extent of the amount of such Defaulted Advance. The failure of any Lender
Party to reimburse the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid
by the Lender Parties to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of its
obligation hereunder to reimburse the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender Party
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other
Lender Party's ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival
of any other agreements of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement and
obligations of each Lender


                                       -94-
<Page>

Party contained in this Section 10.5 shall survive the payment in full of
principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents.

      Section 10.6 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS. The Administrative Agent may
resign as to any or all of the Facilities at any time by giving ten (10) days
prior written notice thereof to the Lender Parties and the Borrower and may be
removed as to all of the Facilities at any time with or without cause by the
Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent as to such of
the Facilities as to which the Administrative Agent has resigned or been
removed. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty
(30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative
Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lender
Parties, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender which
is a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or of any
State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000.00. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent as to all of the Facilities and
upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or
amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary
or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the
perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral
Documents, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent as to less than all of the
Facilities and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing
statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may
be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to
continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the
Collateral Documents, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of
the retiring Administrative Agent as to such Facilities, other than with respect
to funds transfers and other similar aspects of the administration of Borrowings
under such Facilities, issuances of Letters of Credit (notwithstanding any
resignation as Administrative Agent with respect to the Letter of Credit
Facility) and payments by the Borrower in respect of such Facilities, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement as to such Facilities, other than as aforesaid.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent as to all of the Facilities, the provisions of this Article
10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was Administrative Agent as to any Facilities under this Agreement.

      Section 10.7 EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the
non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans) unless the Administrative
Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower specifying such Default
and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the


                                       -95-
<Page>

Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders (and shall give
each Lender notice of each such non-payment). The Administrative Agent shall
(subject to Section 10.2(b) hereof) take such action with respect to such
Default as shall be directed by the Required Lenders.

      Section 10.8 DOCUMENTATION AGENT. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that neither PNC Bank, National Association, nor any Lender which hereafter
becomes Documentation Agent shall have, by reason of its designation as
Documentation Agent, any power, duty, responsibility or liability whatsoever
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.


                                   ARTICLE XI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      Section 11.1 AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed (or, in the case of the Collateral
Documents, consented to) by the Required Lenders and Revolving Credit Lenders
holding greater than 51% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (a) no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders
(other than any Lender Party that is, at such time, a Defaulting Lender), do any
of the following at any time: (i) change the percentage of (A) the Commitments,
(B) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Advances or (C) the aggregate
Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit that, in each case, shall be
required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder; (ii)
release Collateral with a value exceeding $500,000.00 in the aggregate (except
if the sale or other disposition of such Collateral is permitted under this
Agreement or one of the other Loan Documents) or permit the creation,
incurrence, assumption or existence of any Lien on any material portion of the
Collateral in any transaction or series of related transactions to secure any
liabilities or obligations other than Obligations owing to the Secured Parties
under the Loan Documents; (iii) release any of the Guarantors from their
Guaranty; (iv) amend this Section 11.1 or the definition of "Required Lenders";
or (v) limit the liability of any Loan Party under any of the Loan Documents and
(b) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Required Lenders and each Lender that has a Commitment under the Term A
Facility, or Revolving Credit Facility if affected by such amendment, waiver or
consent, (i) increase the Commitments of such Lender or subject such Lender to
any additional obligations, (ii) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the
Notes held by such Lender or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder to such
Lender, (iii) change any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest
on, the Notes held by such Lender or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder
to such Lender or (iv) change the order of application of any prepayment set
forth in Section 2.6 in any manner that materially affects such Lender;
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing
and signed by the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in
addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or


                                       -96-
<Page>

obligations of the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Agreement shall be cumulative and nonexclusive of any other rights and remedies
that Agent or any Lender may have under any other agreement, including the other
Loan Documents, by operation of law or otherwise. Recourse to the Collateral
shall not be required.

      Section 11.4 COSTS AND EXPENSES.

            (a) The Borrower agrees to pay on demand (i) all reasonable costs
and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, (A) all reasonable due diligence,
collateral review, syndication (including printing,

<Page>

distribution and bank meetings), transportation, computer, duplication,
appraisal, audit, insurance, consultant, search, filing and recording fees and

with respect thereto, with respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to
its rights and responsibilities, or the perfection, protection or preservation

in any action, suit or litigation or any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceeding affecting creditors' rights generally or otherwise (including,
without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative
Agent and each Lender Party with respect thereto).

            (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each Lender Party and each of their respective Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each,
an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any

connection with (i) the Transaction, (ii) any acquisition or proposed

stockholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the Transaction is consummated,
except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in
a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Borrower also agrees not to assert any claim against the Administrative
Agent, any Lender Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising
out of or otherwise relating to the Facilities, the actual or proposed use of
the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit, the Loan Documents or any
of the Transaction, other than claims for direct, as opposed to consequential,
damages.

            (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender Party
other than on the last


                                       -99-

Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party any amounts
required to compensate such Lender Party for any additional losses, costs or
expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including,
without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or
other funds required by any Lender Party to fund or maintain such Advance.

            (d) If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or
other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount may be
paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent, in its sole
discretion.

            (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any
Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower contained in Sections 2.10 and 2.12 and this Section
11.4 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other
amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents.

      Section 11.5 RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Article 9 to authorize the Administrative
Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Article
9, each Lender Party and each of its respective Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and otherwise apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender Party or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries against any and all of the
Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
the Note or Notes (if any) held by such Lender Party, irrespective of whether
such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note
or Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender Party
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any
such set-off and application; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights
of each Lender Party and its respective Affiliates under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of set-off) that such Lender Party and its respective Affiliates may have
at law, in equity or otherwise.

      Section 11.6 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall become effective when it
shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender and the
Initial Issuing Bank that each such Initial Lender and the Initial Issuing Bank
has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender Party and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the
right to


                                       -100-
<Page>

assign any of its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior
written consent of the Lender Parties.

      Section 11.7      ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

            (a) Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or
a portion of its rights and obligations in respect of one or more Facilities

Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held
by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a
Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment
of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of
the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000.00, (ii)
no such assignment shall be permitted if, immediately after giving effect
thereto, the Borrower would be required to make payments to or on behalf of the
assignee Lender Party pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or (b) and the assignor Lender
Party was not, at the time of such assignment, entitled to receive any payment
pursuant to Section 2.10(a) or (b), and (iii) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $3,000.00.

            (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from
and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x)
the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender or Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, hereunder and (y) the Lender or Issuing Bank assignor
thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning Lender's or Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

            (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender Party assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (ii) such
assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or any
other Loan Party or the performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of
its obligations under any Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such assignee


                                       -101-
<Page>

confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements referred to in Section 4.6 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning
Lender Party or any other Lender Party and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
to in Section 11.2 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of, and principal
amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender Party from time
to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any
Lender Party at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

            (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment and the appropriate processing and reconciliation fee, the
Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed
and is in substantially the form of EXHIBIT A hereto, (i) accept such Assignment
and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. In the case of any
assignment by a Lender, within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of such
notice, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in
exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note to the order of such
Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it under a
Facility pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender
has retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility, a new Note to the order
of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it
hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit C, D and/or E hereto, as the
case may be .

            (f) The Issuing Bank may assign to an Eligible Assignee all of its
rights and obligations under the undrawn portion of its Letter of Credit
Commitment at any time; PROVIDED,


                                       -102-
<Page>

HOWEVER, that (i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee and (ii)
the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with (other than in the case of an
assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender) a processing and
recordation fee of $3,000.00.

            (g) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more Persons
(other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and
the Note or Notes, if any, held by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Lender
Party's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its
Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note for all
purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
Party in connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any
right to approve any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by
any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver,
modification or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes
or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent
subject to such participation, postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or release
all or substantially all of the Collateral.

            (h) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
11.7, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrower; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, prior to any
such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
received by it from such Lender Party.

            (i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

      Section 11.8 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
telecopier shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of this Agreement.

      Section 11.9 NO LIABILITY OF THE ISSUING BANK. The Borrower assumes all
risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of
Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Issuing
Bank nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b)
the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by the Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the
Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall
be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential,
damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrowers prove were caused by (i) the
Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether
documents presented under any Letter of Credit comply with the terms of the
Letter of Credit or (ii) the Issuing Bank's willful failure to make lawful
payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of a draft and
certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of
Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank
may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary.

Lender Party shall disclose any Confidential Information to any Person without
the consent of the Borrower, other than (a) to the Administrative Agent's or

and advisors and to actual or prospective Eligible Assignees and participants,
and then only on a confidential basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or
regulation or judicial process and (c) as requested or required by any state,
federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or banking.

      Section 11.11 FURTHER ASSURANCES. (a) At any time and from time to time,
upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each other Loan
Party shall execute, deliver and acknowledge or cause to be executed, delivered
or acknowledged, such further documents and instruments and do such further acts
as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order to fully affect the
purposes of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other agreements,
instruments and documents delivered pursuant hereto or in connection with the
Facilities.

            (b) Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note
or Collateral Document which is not of public record and, in the case of any
such mutilation, upon the surrender and cancellation of such Note or Collateral
Document, the Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note or
Collateral Document in the same principal amount thereof (in the case of any
Note) and otherwise of like tenor.
