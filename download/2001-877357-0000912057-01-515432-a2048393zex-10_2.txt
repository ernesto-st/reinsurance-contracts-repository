this Agreement, the Lender agrees to lend to the Borrower and the Borrower may
borrow from time to time between the Closing Date and the Termination Date, such
amounts as are requested by the Borrower up to a maximum aggregate principal
amount equal to the Loan Amount to pay for Project Costs actually incurred by
the Borrower and reflected in the Project Budget as being funded by the Loan.

amounts for which funds to be advanced by the Lender under this Agreement are to
be used. The Lender


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

shall not be required to disburse for any category or line item more than the
amount specified therefor in the Project Budget, but Lender will not
unreasonably withhold or delay its approval of any change to any category or
line item in the Project Budget provided that (i) such change has been made in
accordance with Article IV of the Tenant Lease, and (ii) the aggregate cost of
the Project is not thereby increased, unless the increase is to be paid by
Tenant under the Tenant Lease or, alternatively, a funding source for any such
increase has been provided to Lender's satisfaction.

      2.3 Amount of Advances. In no event shall the Lender be obligated to
advance more than the Construction Loan Amount, or, if less, total Project Costs
actually incurred by the Borrower less Additional Project Funds. In no event
shall any Advance for Direct Costs of constructing the Improvements exceed an
amount equal to (a) the total value (as determined by the Lender) of the labor,
materials, fixtures, machinery and equipment completed, approved and
incorporated into the Land or the Improvements prior to the date of the Draw
Request for such Advance (and which may, subject to compliance with the
requirements set forth in Section 2.7 hereof, include Stored Materials), less
(b) until construction of the Improvements shall be fifty percent (50%) complete
(as defined in Section 2.6 hereof, retainage in an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of such total value ("Retainage"), less (c) the total amount of any
Advances previously made by the Lender for such Direct Costs. Retainage shall be
advanced by the Lender to the Borrower upon satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in ss.12.7. With respect to any other Direct Costs and all Indirect Costs,
in no event shall any Advance exceed an amount equal to the amount of such
Direct Costs and Indirect Costs approved by the Lender, incurred by the Borrower
prior to the date of the Draw Request for such Advances, and theretofore paid or
to be paid with the proceeds of such Advance, less the total amount of any
Advances previously made by the Lender for such Direct Costs and Indirect Costs.

      2.4 Quality of Work. No Advance shall be due unless all work done at the
date the Draw Request for such Advance is submitted is done in a good and
workmanlike manner and without material defects, as confirmed by the report of
the Construction Inspector.

      2.5 Cost Overruns and Savings.

            (a) If the Borrower becomes aware of any change in Project Costs
      which will increase or decrease a category or line item of Project Costs
      reflected on the Project Budget, the Borrower shall immediately notify the
      Lender in writing and promptly submit to the Lender for its approval a
      revised Project Budget. Lender shall not unreasonably withhold or delay
      its approval of any such revised Project Budget provided that (i) such
      change has been made in accordance with Article IV of the Tenant Lease,
      and (ii) the aggregate cost of the Project is not thereby increased,
      unless the increase is to be paid by Tenant under the Tenant Lease or,
      alternatively, a funding source for any such increase has been provided to
      Lender's satisfaction.

            (b) If the revised Project Budget indicates an increase in a
      category or line item of Project Costs subject to the provisions of
      Section 10.1 hereof, no further Advances need


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>

      be made by the Lender unless and until the revised Project Budget so
      submitted by the Borrower is approved by the Lender.

            (c) If the revised Project Budget indicates a decrease in a category
      or line item of Project Costs, subject to the provisions of Section 10.1
      hereof, no reductions in Project Costs will be made or savings reallocated
      by the Borrower unless and until (i) the revised Project Budget so
      submitted by the Borrower is approved by the Lender, and (ii) in the case
      of decreases in a category or line item of Direct Costs, the Borrower has
      furnished the Lender and the Construction Inspector with evidence
      satisfactory to them that the labor performed and materials supplied in
      connection with such category or line item of Direct Costs have been
      satisfactorily completed in accordance with the Plans and Specifications
      and paid for in full.

      2.6 Contingency Reserve. The amount of $634,338 ($141,795 for Indirect
Costs and $492,543 for Direct Costs) has been allocated as Contingency Reserve
in the Project Budget and will only be disbursed upon the prior approval of the
Lender which may be withheld by the Lender in the Lender's reasonable judgment.
The disbursement of a portion of Contingency Reserve shall in no way prejudice
the Lender from withholding disbursement of any further portion of Contingency
Reserve. Any portion of the Contingency Reserve not advanced pursuant to this
Loan Agreement upon completion of construction of the Improvements shall be
advanced to Borrower and applied as follows: (i) 75% thereof shall be applied to
the partial prepayment of principal of the Subordinate Loan pursuant to Section
4.4 of the loan agreement for the Subordinate Loan; and (ii) 25% thereof shall
be paid by Borrower to its members or otherwise as Borrower shall determine.

      2.7 Stored Materials. The Lender shall not be required to disburse any
funds for any materials, furnishings, fixtures, machinery or equipment not yet
incorporated into the Land or Improvements ("Stored Materials"), however, if the
Lender elects to disburse any funds for Stored Materials, any such disbursement
shall be subject to retainage in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) and shall
be contingent upon the Lender receiving satisfactory evidence that:

            (a) the Stored Materials are components in a form ready for
      incorporation into the Land or the Improvements and shall be so
      incorporated within a period of thirty (30) days;

            (b) the Stored Materials are stored at the Land, or at such other
      site as the Lender shall reasonably approve, and are protected against
      theft and damage;

            (c) the Stored Materials have been paid for in full or will be paid
      for with the funds to be disbursed and all lien rights and claims of the
      supplier have been released or will be released upon payment with
      disbursed funds;

            (d) the Lender has or will have upon payment with disbursed funds a
      perfected, first priority security interest in the Stored Materials; and


                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

      replacement cost.

Each Draw Request shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower
that all of the conditions set forth in this Agreement to such Advance,
including, without limitation, ss.12, have been satisfied on the date of such
Draw Request.

      3.2 Notice and Frequency of Advance. Each Draw Request shall be submitted
to the Lender at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the requested Advance,
and no more frequently than once each month. The Lender shall fund the requested
Advance within ten (10) days after the Draw Request for such Advance is made in
accordance with the requirements of Section 3.1 hereof.

      3.3 Payment of Funds Advanced. The Lender shall pay the proceeds of each
Advance into a separate bank account of the Borrower established for the purpose

the Lender shall have given the Borrower two (2) days' notice of its intention
to do so, the Lender may make any or all Advances (a) for Direct Costs incurred
under the Construction Contract directly to Contractor, (b) through the Title

determines payment is due. Any portion of the Loan so disbursed by the Lender
shall be deemed disbursed as of the date on which the Lender makes such
disbursement and all such advances shall satisfy pro tanto the obligations of
the Lender hereunder and shall be secured by the Mortgage and the other Security
Documents as fully as if made directly to the Borrower. The execution of this
Agreement by the Borrower shall, and hereby does, constitute an irrevocable


                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

authorization so to advance the proceeds of the Loan. No further authorization
from the Borrower shall be necessary to warrant such advances.

      3.5 Advances Do Not Constitute a Waiver. No Advance made by the Lender
shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions to the Lender's obligation to
make further Advances nor any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
nor, in the event the Borrower fails to satisfy any such condition, shall any
such Advance have the effect of precluding the Lender from thereafter declaring
such failure to satisfy a condition to be an Event of Default.

      3.6 Right to Retain the Construction Inspector.

            (a) The Lender shall have the right to retain, at the Borrower's
      cost and expense, the Construction Inspector to perform various services
      on behalf of the Lender, including, without limitation, to make periodic
      inspections (approximately at the date of each Draw Request) for the
      purpose of assuring that construction of the Improvements to date is in
      accordance with the Plans and Specifications, to advise the Lender of the
      anticipated cost of and time for completion of construction of the
      Improvements and the adequacy of any Contingency Reserve, and to review
      the Construction Contract and subcontracts. The Construction Inspector
      named herein is acceptable to Borrower, however, if Lender shall elect to
      appoint a new Construction Inspector, the Lender shall appoint a
      Construction Inspector that has an office located in The Commonwealth of
      Massachusetts.

            (b) The fees and expenses of the Construction Inspector shall be
      paid by the Borrower forthwith upon billing therefor (whether the same are
      charged directly to the Lender or the Borrower), and, if the Lender shall
      pay any such fees and expenses, the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender
      for such fees and expenses forthwith upon request therefor.

            (c) Neither the Lender nor the Construction Inspector shall have any
      liability to the Borrower on account of (i) the services performed by the
      Construction Inspector, or (ii) any approval by the Construction Inspector
      of construction of the Improvements. Neither the Lender nor the
      Construction Inspector assumes any obligation to the Borrower or any other
      Person concerning the quality of construction of the Improvements or the
      absence therefrom of defects.

      4. THE NOTE; REPAYMENT OF LOAN.

      4.1 The Note. The obligation of the Borrower to pay the Loan Amount or, if
less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Advances made by the Lender
hereunder plus accrued interest thereon, shall be evidenced by the Note. In the
event the Note is lost, destroyed or mutilated at any time prior to payment in
full of the indebtedness evidenced thereby, the Borrower shall execute a new
note in the form of the Note. The Note shall not be necessary to establish the
indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender on account of Advances made under
this Agreement.


                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

      4.2 The Record. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Lender to make or
cause to be made, at or about the time of the Drawdown Date of any Advance or at
the time of receipt of any payment of the principal of the Note, an appropriate
notation on the Record reflecting the making of such Advance or (as the case may
be) the receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of the Loan set forth on
the Record shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof owing
and unpaid to the Lender, but the failure to record, or any error in so
recording, any such amount on the Record shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Note to make payments of
principal or interest on the Note when due. Further, the outstanding amount of
the Loan as reflected on the Record from time to time shall be considered
correct and binding on the Borrower unless within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of any notice by the Borrower of such outstanding amount, the Borrower
shall notify the Lender to the contrary.

      4.3 Interest on the Loan; Payments on the Loan. The Loan shall bear
interest, and be payable, as follows:

            (a) the "Interest Rate" referred to in the Note shall be determined
      as follows:

                  (i)   During the Construction period, the "Interest Rate" (as
                        referred to in the Note) on the outstanding principal
                        balance of the Note shall be that rate of interest per
                        annum equal to LIBOR plus two and one-half percent
                        (2.5%). As used herein, the term "LIBOR", with respect
                        to the relevant Interest Period (as defined below),
                        shall mean the rate per annum (rounded upward, if
                        necessary, to the nearest one-eighth (1/8) of one
                        percent (1%) published on the date one "Eurodollar
                        Business Day" (as defined below) immediately preceding
                        the date of the LIBOR contract for each new Interest
                        Period, as reported in the section entitled "Money
                        Rates" in the eastern edition of the Wall Street Journal
                        as the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate for U.S.
                        dollar deposits (or if the Wall Street Journal shall
                        cease to be publicly available or if the information
                        contained in the Wall Street Journal, in Lender's
                        reasonable judgment, shall cease to accurately reflect
                        such London Interbank Offered Rate, then LIBOR shall be
                        as reported by any publicly available source of similar
                        market data selected by Lender that, in Lender's
                        reasonable judgment, accurately reflects such London
                        Interbank Offered Rate). The term "Interest Period"
                        shall mean each calendar month during the term of the
                        Loan and shall be deemed to be the respective one-month
                        term of a particular LIBOR contract; provided, however,

                        transactions.

                  (ii)  Upon the completion of the Construction Period, the
                        Interest Rate shall be fixed at a rate per annum equal
                        to the then applicable yield to maturity of 10-year U.S.
                        Treasury obligations as reported in the section entitled
                        "Money Rates" in the eastern edition of the Wall Street
                        Journal (or if the Wall Street Journal shall cease to be
                        publicly available or if the information contained in
                        the Wall Street Journal, in Lender's reasonable
                        judgment, shall cease to accurately reflect Treasury
                        yields, then such yields shall be as reported by any
                        publicly available source of similar market data
                        selected by Lender that, in Lender's reasonable
                        judgment, accurately reflects such yield), plus two and

                  (i)   During the Construction Period payments on the Note
                        shall be of interest only and shall be payable monthly
                        in arrears.

                  (ii)  After the end of the Construction Period and upon the

                        4.3(a)(ii) above, the Note shall be payable in constant
                        monthly payments of principal and interest in such
                        amount as will fully amortize the unpaid principal
                        amount of the Note over a twenty-five year period. On
                        the first day of February, 2006, the entire unpaid
                        balance of the Note, unless sooner paid, shall
                        immediately be due and payable. All such payments on the
                        Note shall be applied first to accrued interest with the
                        balance in reduction of principal. In the event of the

                        interest and principal shall not be adjusted but shall
                        continue to be paid as indicated.

time to prepay the Note on or before the Maturity Date, either in whole or in
part, except as follows:

            (a) Through the end of the third Loan Year (as defined in the Note),
      the Loan shall not be subject to prepayment at the option of Borrower,
      except with the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be
      granted or withheld in Lender's sole discretion.

            (b) During the fourth Loan Year and fifth Loan Year and thereafter
      from time to time if so requested by Lender, Borrower shall use all
      commercially reasonable efforts to refinance the Loan with a third-party
      institutional lender (or lenders) identified by Borrower. If Borrower is
      able to refinance the Loan at an interest rate not more than 50


                                     - 16 -

      basis points greater than the Interest Rate on the Loan and otherwise on
      terms comparable to the Loan, Lender shall either (i) allow such
      refinancing, in which case the Loan shall be prepaid in whole (but not in
      part) at par, or (ii) extend (if not already extended) the term of the
      Loan to 15 years as provided in Section 5.2. If Borrower is able to
      refinance the Loan only on terms more onerous than are specified above,
      Lender may or may not permit a prepayment of the Loan so as to enable such
      refinancing, in Lender's sole discretion.

            (c) During (if applicable) the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and
      fifteenth Loan Years, Borrower shall have the right at its option to
      prepay the Loan in whole (but not in part) at par, provided that the
      interest rate on any refinancing incurred in connection with such
      prepayment shall be equal to or less than the Interest Rate and provided
      that the loan payments on such refinancing shall not be greater than
      payments on the Loan would have been through what would have been the
      Maturity Date of the Loan but for such prepayment.

            (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, the
      Loan shall not be subject to prepayment at the option of Borrower, except
      with the prior written consent of lender, which consent may be granted or
      withheld in Lender's sole discretion.

the Loan outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon.

Section 4.4(b) above, Lender shall, without the necessity for the consent of
Tenant or any other party, extend the Maturity Date of the Loan to February 1,

      original contract sum (prior to any change orders) in an amount in excess
      of $500,000 (provided, however, that this subsection (c) shall not apply
      to

      prior approval of the Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably
      withheld or delayed, and in the case of the Construction Contract, without
      the prior approval of any surety or surety companies issuing any Payment,
      Performance or Lien Bonds.

            (b) The Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, terminate or
      cancel, or cause or permit to exist any condition which would result in

      of any obligations of any other party under, the Construction Contract,
      the Tenant Lease or the Ground Lease.

            (c) The Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, waive or agree or

      thirty (30) days after notice thereof from the Lender, or, in any case
      where such default is susceptible to cure but cannot with due diligence be

or any Guarantor to perform any Borrower or Guarantor obligation hereunder or
under any other Loan Document which is a result of or caused by a Lender failure
to perform a Lender obligation hereunder constitute an Event of Default.


                                     - 37 -

      13.2 Termination of Advances and Acceleration. If any one or more of the
Events of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Lender may by notice to the
Borrower declare its obligations to make Advances hereunder to be terminated,
whereupon the same shall terminate and the Lender shall be relieved of all
obligations to make Advances to the Borrower, and/or declare all unpaid
principal of and accrued interest on the Note, together with all other amounts
owing under the Loan Documents, to be immediately due and payable, whereupon
same shall become and be immediately due and payable, anything in the Loan
Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, and without presentment, protest,
demand or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Borrower; provided that if any one or more of the Events of Default
specified in ss.13.1(l), ss.13.1(m), or ss.13.1(n), above, shall occur with
respect to any Obligor, the Lender's obligations to make Advances hereunder
automatically shall so terminate and all unpaid principal of and accrued
interest on the Note, together with all other amounts owing under the Loan
Documents, automatically shall become and be immediately so due and payable,
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Lender.

      13.3 Completion of Project. If any one or more of the Events of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lender shall have
terminated its obligations to make Advances and accelerated the maturity of the
Loan pursuant to ss.13.2, the Lender, if the construction of the Improvements
has not been fully completed, may cause the Project to be completed and may
enter upon the Land upon two (2) Business Days' written notice to the Borrower,
and construct, equip and complete the Project in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications, with such changes therein as the Lender may, from time to time,
and in its sole discretion, deem appropriate. In connection with any
construction of the Project undertaken by the Lender pursuant to the provisions
of this Section, the Lender may:

            (a) use any funds of the Borrower, including any balance which may
      be held by the Lender as security or in escrow, and any funds remaining
      unadvanced under the Loan;

            (b) employ existing contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects,
      engineers, and the like, or terminate the same and employ others;

            (c) employ security watchmen to protect the Project;

            (d) make such additions, changes and corrections in the Plans and
      Specifications as shall, in the judgment of the Lender, be necessary or
      desirable;

            (e) take over and use any and all Personal Property contracted for
      or purchased by the Borrower, if appropriate, or dispose of the same as
      the Lender sees fit;

            (f) execute all applications and certificates on behalf of the
      Borrower which may be required by any Governmental Authority or
      Requirements or contract documents or agreements;


                                     - 38 -
<PAGE>

            (g) pay, settle or compromise all existing or future bills and
      claims which are or may be liens against the Project, or may be necessary
      for the completion of the Improvements or the clearance of title to the
      Project;

            (h) complete the marketing and leasing of leasable space in the
      Improvements, enter into new Leases, and modify or amend existing Leases,
      all as the Lender shall deem to be necessary or desirable;

            (i) prosecute and defend all actions and proceedings in connection
      with the construction of the Improvements or in any other way affecting
      the Land or the Improvements and take such action and require such
      performance as the Lender deems necessary under any Payment and
      Performance Bonds; and

            (j) take such action hereunder, or refrain from acting hereunder, as
      the Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time
      determine, and without any limitation whatsoever, to carry out the intent
      of this Section.

The Borrower shall be liable to the Lender for all costs paid or incurred for
the construction, equipping and completion of the Project, whether the same
shall be paid or incurred pursuant to the provisions of this Section or
otherwise, and all payments made or liabilities incurred by the Lender hereunder
of any kind whatsoever shall be deemed Advances made to the Borrower under this
Agreement and shall be secured by the Mortgage and the other Security Documents.
To the extent that any costs so paid or incurred by the Lender, together with
all other Advances made by the Lender hereunder, exceed the Loan Amount, the
amount of such excess costs shall be added to the Loan Amount, and the
Borrower's obligation to repay the same, together with interest thereon at the
Default Rate, shall be deemed to be evidenced by this Agreement and secured by
the Mortgage and the other Security Documents. In the event the Lender takes
possession of the Project and assumes control of such construction as aforesaid,
it shall not be obligated to continue such construction longer than it shall see
fit and may thereafter, at any time, change any course of action undertaken by
it or abandon such construction and decline to make further payments for the
account of the Borrower whether or not the Project shall have been completed.
For the purpose of this Section, the construction, equipping and completion of
the Project shall be deemed to include any action necessary to cure any Event of
Default by the Borrower under any of the terms and provisions of any of the Loan
Documents.

      13.4 Other Remedies. If any one or more of the Events of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lender shall have
terminated its obligations to make Advances or accelerated the maturity of the
Loan pursuant to ss.13.2, the Lender may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Note or any of the other Loan
Documents by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding,
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which
the Obligations are evidenced, including as permitted by applicable law the
obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if any amount owed to
the Lender shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to
enforce the payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of the Lender.
No remedy


                                     - 39 -
<PAGE>

conferred upon the Lender or the holder of the Note in this Agreement or in any
of the other Loan Documents is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and
each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given hereunder or thereunder or now or hereafter existing at law
or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.

      13.5 Distribution of Collateral Proceeds. In the event that, following the
occurrence or during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the
Lender receives any monies in connection with the enforcement of any the
Security Documents, or otherwise with respect to the realization upon any of the
Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for application as follows:

            (a) First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
      reimbursement of the Lender for or in respect of all reasonable costs,
      expenses, disbursements and losses which shall have been incurred or
      sustained by the Lender in connection with the collection of such monies
      by the Lender, for the exercise, protection or enforcement by the Lender
      of all or any of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Lender
      under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or in respect of
      the Collateral or in support of any provision of adequate indemnity to the
      Lender against any taxes or liens which by law shall have, or may have,
      priority over the rights of the Lender to such monies;

            (b) Second, to all other Obligations in such order or preference as
      the Lender may determine; provided, however, that the Lender may in its
      discretion make proper allowance to take into account any Obligations not
      then due and payable;

            (c) Third, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other provisions
      for payment in full satisfactory to the Lender of all of the Obligations,
      to the payment of any obligations required to be paid pursuant to
      ss.9-504(1)(c) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of
      Massachusetts; and

            (d) Fourth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to the Borrower or
      to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

      13.6 Power of Attorney. For the purposes of carrying out the provisions
and exercising the rights, remedies, powers and privileges granted by or
referred to in this Article, the Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints the Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact after an Event of
Default, with full power of substitution, to execute, acknowledge and deliver
any instruments and do and perform any acts which are referred to in this
Article, in the name and on behalf of the Borrower. The power vested in such
attorney-in-fact is, and shall be deemed to be, coupled with an interest and
irrevocable.

      13.7 Waivers. The Borrower hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law (a) all presentments, demands for performance, notices of
nonperformance (except to the extent required by the provisions hereof or of any
of the other Loan Documents), protests and notices of dishonor, (b) any
requirement of diligence or promptness on the Lender's part in the enforcement
of its rights (but not fulfillment of its obligations) under the provisions of
this


                                     - 40 -
<PAGE>

Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and (c) any and all notices of
every kind and description which may be required to be given by any statute or
rule of law and any defense of any kind which the Borrower may now or hereafter
have with respect to its liability under this Agreement or under any of the
other Loan Documents.

      14. SETOFF. Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, during the
continuance of any Event of Default, any deposits (general or specific, time or
demand, provisional or final, regardless of currency, maturity, or the branch of
the Lender where such deposits are held) or other sums credited by or due from
the Lender to the Borrower and any securities or other property of the Borrower
in the possession of the Lender may be applied to or set off against the payment
of the Project Obligations and any and all other Obligations.

      15. AGREEMENTS RELATING TO TENANT LEASE. FAILURE TO FUND

      (a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Sepracor, Inc. is both Lender
under the Loan and Tenant under the Tenant Lease, and each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is a true loan transaction and the Tenant
Lease is a true lease transaction and that each party will treat each of such
transactions as a loan or a lease, as applicable, for all purposes including
such party's tax returns and financial statements. The parties acknowledge and
agree that each of such transactions has been entered into on an arms-length
basis and on terms which are commercially reasonable under current market
conditions.

      (b) If an Event of Default as set forth in Section 13.1 shall have
occurred and be continuing solely by reason of such default by Tenant under the
Tenant Lease, Lender shall forbear from foreclosing on the Mortgage or
exercising other remedies under any of the Security Documents (except as may be
required to protect the collateral covered thereby) for a period of eighteen
months provided that (i) Borrower and Guarantors are not in default under any of
the Loan Documents, and (ii) Borrower and Guarantors are using diligent efforts
to obtain a refinancing of the Loan. Such eighteen-month period shall be
extended if and to the extent that Tenant fails to vacate the Project within
ninety days after demand therefor by Borrower following the occurrence and
continuance of an Event of Default under and as defined in the Tenant Lease.
Interest on the Note shall continue to accrue during any such forbearance
period, but debt service (interest and/or principal) on the Note shall be offset
by Basic Rent (as defined in the Tenant Lease) which is owed but is not being
paid under the Tenant Lease. Such offset shall be applied first against interest
otherwise due and payable on the Note, and then to the extent unpaid Basic Rent
has not been fully offset against interest, against principal.

      (c) If Lender is unable to fund any Advance on the Loan (all the
conditions therefor having been satisfied), 75% of each dollar of Borrower's
actual damages resulting therefrom, up to a maximum of $2,000,000, shall be
offset against payments due on the Subordinated Loan, as provided in the loan
agreement with respect thereto. In addition, in such event (i) Lender shall be
required to subordinate the Security Documents and the security documents with
respect to the Subordinate Loan so as to enable Borrower to obtain alternative
financing for the Project on a first lien basis, and (ii) Tenant shall have the
right to exercise its purchase option under the Tenant Lease as to the Project.
The provisions of any such subordination shall be reasonably


                                     - 41 -
<PAGE>

satisfactory in form and substance to the lender providing such alternative
financing, and shall be such that Lender's entitlement to payment shall be
subordinate the new lender both as to current cash flow (as to payments of
interest) and in the case of a refinancing or sale (in each case as to both
principal and accrued interest), but shall not have the effect of negating
altogether Lender's entitlement to be repaid from the Project and the income
therefrom if and when possible.

      16. EXPENSES. The Borrower agrees to pay (a) the reasonable costs of
producing and reproducing this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other
agreements and instruments mentioned herein, (b) any taxes (including any
interest and penalties in respect thereto) payable by the Lender (other than
taxes based upon the Lender's net income), including any recording, mortgage or
intangibles taxes in connection with the Mortgage, or other taxes payable on or
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
taxes payable by the Lender after the Closing Date (the Borrower hereby agreeing
to indemnify the Lender with respect thereto), (c) all title insurance premiums,
and the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Lender's counsel or
any local counsel to the Lender incurred in connection with the preparation,
administration or interpretation of the Loan and the Loan Documents and other
instruments mentioned herein, the making of each Advance hereunder, and
amendments, modifications, approvals, consents or waivers hereto or hereunder,
(d) the fees, expenses and disbursements of the Lender incurred in connection
with the preparation, administration or interpretation of the Loan and the Loan
Documents and other instruments mentioned herein, and the making of each Advance
hereunder (including all fees paid to the Construction Inspector, Appraisal
fees, and surveyor fees) (e) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, which attorneys may be employees of the
Lender) and the fees and costs of consultants, accountants, auctioneers,
receivers, brokers, property managers, appraisers, investment bankers or other
experts retained by the Lender in connection with (i) the enforcement of or
preservation of rights under any of the Loan Documents against the Borrower or
any Obligor or the administration thereof after the occurrence of a Default or
Event of Default and (ii) any litigation, proceeding or dispute whether arising
hereunder or otherwise, in any way related to the Lender's relationship with the
Borrower or any Party, and (f) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements
of the Lender incurred in connection with UCC searches, UCC filings, title
rundowns, title searches or mortgage recordings. The covenants of this Section
shall survive payment or satisfaction of payment of all amounts owing with
respect to the Note.

      17. INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Lender from and against any and all claims, actions and suits, whether
groundless or otherwise, and from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages and expenses of every nature and character arising out of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby including, without limitations, (a) any brokerage, leasing, finders or
similar fees, (b) any disbursement of the proceeds of any of the Advances, (c)
any condition of the Project whether related to the quality of construction or
otherwise, (d) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of any
of the Advances, (e) any actual or alleged violation of any Requirements or
Project Approvals, or (f) the Borrower or any Party entering into or performing
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, in each case including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and
allocated costs of


                                     - 42 -
<PAGE>

internal counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation
or other proceeding. In litigation, or the preparation therefor, the Lender
shall be entitled to select its own counsel and, in addition to the foregoing
indemnity, the Borrower agrees to pay promptly the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall
survive the repayment of the Loan and shall continue in full force and effect so
long as the possibility of such claim, action or suit exists. If, and to the
extent that the obligations of the Borrower under this Section are unenforceable
for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to
the payment in satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under
applicable law. The foregoing indemnification shall not be applicable to any
matter arising out of the Tenant Lease or the relationship of Borrower and
Lender as landlord and tenant thereunder, as to which matters the terms and
provisions of the Tenant Lease shall govern.

      18. LIABILITY OF THE LENDER; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The liability of the
Lender to the Borrower for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by the
Lender shall not exceed a sum equal to (i) the amount which the Lender shall be
determined to have failed to advance in consequence of a breach by the Lender of
its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) interest thereon at the default rate
payable by the Borrower under the terms of the Note for Advances which the
Borrower is to receive hereunder, computed from the date when the Advance should
have been made by the Lender to the date when the Advance is, in fact, made by
the Lender, and, upon the making of any such payment by the Lender to the
Borrower, the same shall be treated as an Advance under this Agreement, in the
same fashion as any other Advance under the terms of this Agreement and (iii)
actual losses incurred by the Borrower as a result of Lender's breach which
reasonably could be foreseen by the Lender. The Lender acknowledges and agrees
that the Borrower shall have the remedy of specific performance by the Lender of
the Lender's obligations under this Agreement. Moreover, if Lender is unable to
fund an Advance when obligated to do so under this Agreement, Borrower shall
have certain rights of offset as to the Subordinate Loan, as set forth in
Section 15 of the Loan Agreement for the Subordinate Loan.

      19. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. All conditions to the performance of the
obligations of the Lender under this Agreement, including the obligation to make
Advances, are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Lender and
no other Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions
in accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that the Lender will
refuse to make Advances in the absence of strict compliance with any or all
thereof and no other Person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a
beneficiary of such conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in
whole or in part by the Lender at any time if in its sole discretion it deems it
desirable to do so. In particular, the Lender makes no representations and
assumes no obligations as to third parties concerning the quality of the
construction by the Borrower of the Improvements or the absence therefrom of
defects.

      20. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, ETC. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made herein, in the Note, in any of the other Loan Documents or
in any documents or other papers delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower or
any Party pursuant hereto and thereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon
by the Lender, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by
it, and shall survive the making by the Lender of


                                     - 43 -
<PAGE>

the Advances, as herein contemplated, and shall continue in full force and
effect either (i) so long as any amount due under this Agreement or the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents remains outstanding or the Lender has any
obligation to make any Advances or (ii) for such longer period as may be
provided for herein or in any other Loan Document. All statements contained in
any certificate or other paper delivered to the Lender at any time by or on
behalf of any Party or any Subsidiary thereof pursuant hereto or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall constitute representations and
warranties by such Person.

      21. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents may
be assigned by Lender to any Tenant Affiliate after the Commencement Date (as
each such term is defined in the Lease), but not otherwise, except with the
written consent of Borrower, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

      22. RELATIONSHIP. The relationship between the Lender and the Borrower is
solely that of a lender and borrower, and nothing contained herein or in any of
the other Loan Documents shall in any manner be construed as making the parties
hereto partners, joint venturers or any other relationship other than lender and
borrower.

      23. NOTICES. Except as otherwise provided herein or in any other Loan
Document, each notice, demand, election or request provided for or permitted to
be given pursuant to this Agreement (hereinafter in this Section referred to as
"Notice") must be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given or
served by personal delivery, or by sending same by nationally recognized
overnight courier or by depositing same in the United States Mail, postpaid and

Each Notice shall be effective upon being personally delivered or upon being
sent by overnight courier or upon being deposited in the United States Mail as
aforesaid. The time period in which a response to such Notice must be given or
any action taken with respect thereto (if any), however, shall commence to run
from the date of receipt if personally delivered or sent by overnight courier,
or if so deposited in the United States Mail, the earlier of three (3) Business
Days following such deposit or the date of receipt as disclosed on the return
receipt. Rejection or other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver
because of changed address for which no Notice was given shall be deemed to be
receipt of the Notice sent. By giving at least thirty (30) days' prior Notice
thereof, the Borrower or the Lender shall have the right from time to time and
at any time during the term of this Agreement to change their respective
addresses and each shall have the right to specify as its address any other
address within the United States of America.

      24. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents,
except as otherwise specifically provided therein, are contracts under the laws
of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and shall for all purposes be construed in
accordance with and governed by the laws of said Commonwealth (excluding the
laws applicable to conflicts or choice of law).

      25. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVERS. THE BORROWER AND EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY (A) SUBMITS TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS OVER ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND (B) WAIVES
ANY AND ALL PERSONAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE (I) TO THE RIGHT, IF
ANY, TO TRIAL BY JURY, (II) TO OBJECT TO JURISDICTION WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH OF
MASSACHUSETTS OR VENUE IN ANY PARTICULAR FORUM WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH OF
MASSACHUSETTS, AND (III) TO THE RIGHT, IF ANY, TO CLAIM OR RECOVER ANY SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES OTHER THAN ACTUAL


                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>

DAMAGES. THE BORROWER AND EACH PARTY AGREES THAT, IN ADDITION TO ANY METHODS OF
SERVICE OF PROCESS PROVIDED FOR UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL,
RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED DIRECTED TO THE BORROWER AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH IN
ss.22 ABOVE, AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE COMPLETE FIVE (5) DAYS AFTER THE SAME
SHALL BE SO MAILED. NOTHING CONTAINED HEREIN, HOWEVER, SHALL PREVENT THE LENDER
FROM BRINGING ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING OR EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS AGAINST
ANY COLLATERAL AND AGAINST THE BORROWER, AND AGAINST ANY PROPERTY OF THE
BORROWER, IN ANY OTHER STATE. INITIATING SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING OR
TAKING SUCH ACTION IN ANY STATE SHALL IN NO EVENT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THE
AGREEMENT CONTAINED HEREIN THAT THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
SHALL GOVERN THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER, EACH PARTY, AND THE
LENDER HEREUNDER OR THE SUBMISSION HEREIN BY THE BORROWER AND EACH PARTY TO
PERSONAL JURISDICTION WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.

      26. HEADINGS. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not define or limit the provisions hereof.

      27. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and any amendment hereof may be executed
in several counterparts and by each party on a separate counterpart, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one instrument. In proving this Agreement it shall not
be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart signed by
the party against whom enforcement is sought.

      28. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, ETC. The Loan Documents and any other documents
executed in connection herewith or therewith express the entire understanding of
the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither this
Agreement nor any term hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated,
except as provided in ss.29.

      29. CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in any particular provision of this Agreement, any consent or approval
required or permitted by this Agreement to be given by the Lender may be given,
and any term of this Agreement or of any other instrument related hereto or
mentioned herein may be amended, and the performance or observance by the
Borrower of any terms of this Agreement or such other instrument or the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally
or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but
only with, the written consent of the Lender. No waiver shall extend to or
affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent
thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Lender in
exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be
prejudicial thereto. No Advance made by the lender hereunder during the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default shall constitute a waiver
thereof. No notice to or demand upon the


                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>

Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

      30. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect to each and
every covenant, agreement and obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

      31. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if
any one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in
whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability
shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such
jurisdiction, and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any
other jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction.
