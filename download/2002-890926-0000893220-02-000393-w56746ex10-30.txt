                                      -11-
<PAGE>
shall (i) be payable to the order of such Bank and be dated the Effective Date
if such Bank shall be a party hereto on the Effective Date or the effective date
of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a party
hereto if such Bank shall become a party hereto after the Effective Date, (ii)
be in a stated principal amount equal to such Bank's Commitment (plus, if such
Bank shall be a Part C Bank, such Bank's Contingent Commitment) and be payable
in the principal amount of the Loans evidenced thereby, (iii) mature, with
respect to each Loan evidenced thereby, on the Expiry Date, (iv) bear interest
as provided in the appropriate clause of Section 2.06 in respect of the Loans
evidenced thereby and (v) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and be
secured by the Security Agreement. Each Bank will note on its internal records
the amount of each Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will
prior to any transfer of its Note endorse on the reverse side thereof the
outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any
such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such
Loans.

            Section 2.06 Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in
respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Loan from the date the proceeds
thereof are made available to the Borrower until the maturity thereof (whether
by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the
Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin.

            (b) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable by the
Borrower hereunder shall bear interest from the date payment thereof was due

to 4.0% per annum in excess of the Base Rate in effect from time to time.

            (c) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i)
in respect of each Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
March, June, September and December, and (ii) in respect of each Loan, on any
prepayment (on the amount prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

            Section 2.07 Capital Adequacy. If any Bank determines at any time
that the introduction of or change to any applicable law or governmental rule,
regulation, order or request (whether or not having the force of law) concerning
capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, in any case
occurring after the date hereof, will have the effect of increasing the amount
of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank based on the
existence of its Commitment and/or Contingent Commitment hereunder or its
obligations hereunder, then the Borrower shall pay to such Bank, upon its
written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to
compensate such Bank for the increased cost to such Bank as a result of such
increase of capital. In determining such additional amounts, such Bank will act
reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods
which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's determination of compensation
owing under this Section 2.07 shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Bank, upon determining
that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.07, will
give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show the
basis for the


                                      -12-
<PAGE>
calculation of such additional amounts. The failure to give any such notice
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of the Borrower's obligations to pay
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.07, provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to pay any such additional amounts (i) until it receives
written notice from a Bank in accordance with this Section 2.07 or (ii) with
respect to any period prior to 60 days prior to the date any such notice is
received, unless the relevant introduction or change has a retroactive effect,
in which case the Borrower's obligation to pay additional amounts pursuant to
this Section 2.07 may encompass the entire period of retroactivity.

            Section 2.08 Obligations of Defaulting Banks. Anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event any Part C Bank
makes a Loan pursuant to Section 2.01(b) (a "Part C Loan") because of a Part B
Bank failing to make a Loan required to be made pursuant to this Agreement, such
Part C Bank, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Credit Document, shall be entitled to receive, from
such Part B Bank, upon demand, the principal amount of such Part C Loan, plus
interest thereon, from the date made until paid, at the Federal Funds Rate for
the first three days and at the Base Rate plus 2% per annum thereafter. Upon any
such payment by a Part B Bank, such Part B Bank shall be subrogated to the
rights of the relevant Part C Bank with respect to the relevant Part C Loan. In
addition, for so long as any amounts are owed to any Part C Bank with respect to
any Part C Loan, any amounts otherwise owing by a Part B Bank pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be paid on a pro rata basis to the
Part C Banks until all amounts with respect to outstanding Part C Loans have
been repaid.

date as the Commitments shall have been terminated) computed at a rate equal to
0.6% per annum on the daily average Unutilized Commitments of the Banks;
provided, however, that any Commitment Fee accrued with respect to the
Unutilized Commitment of a Defaulting Bank during the period prior to the time
such Bank became a Defaulting Bank and unpaid at such time shall not be payable
by the Borrower so long as such Bank shall be a Defaulting Bank except to the
extent that such Commitment Fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the
Borrower prior to such time; and provided further that no Commitment Fee shall
accrue on the Unutilized Commitment of a Defaulting Bank so long as such Bank
shall be a Defaulting Bank.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay each Part C Bank a Commitment Fee for
the period from the Effective Date until the Expiry Date (or such earlier date
as the Contingent Commitment of such Part C Bank shall have been terminated)
computed as agreed in writing from time to time by the Borrower and such Part C
Bank.


                                      -13-
<PAGE>
            (c) Accrued Commitment Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December of
each year and on the Expiry Date or upon such earlier date as the Commitments or
the Contingent Commitments, as the case may be, shall be terminated, and shall
be based on a 365/366-day year and actual days elapsed.

            (d) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent such fees in connection with
the Credit Documents as may be agreed to from time to time between the Borrower
and the Agent.

            Section 3.02 Voluntary Termination of Unutilized Commitments and
Unutilized Contingent Commitments. Upon at least five Business Days' prior
notice to the Agent at its Notice Office, the Borrower shall have the right to
terminate the Unutilized Commitments or the Unutilized Contingent Commitments,
or both, in whole or in part, in minimum aggregate amounts of $5,000,000 (or, if
greater, in integral multiples of $1,000,000), provided that the Borrower shall
concurrently satisfy its obligations, if any, at such time under Section 3.01.

            Section 3.03 Mandatory Termination of Commitments and Contingent
Commitments. (a) The Commitment of each Bank shall be permanently reduced on
each date a Loan is made by such Bank pursuant to Section 2.01(a) by the amount
of such Loan. In addition, the Contingent Commitment of each Part C Bank shall
be permanently reduced on each date a Loan is made pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
by any Bank that is not a Part C Bank by an amount equal to 30% of such Loan.
The Contingent Commitment of each Part C Bank shall be permanently reduced on
each date a Loan is made by such Part C Bank pursuant to Section 2.01(b) by the
amount of such Loan.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower
shall have the right to unilaterally terminate the Commitment and/or Contingent
Commitment of any Bank if, at any time after the Effective Date (with respect to
any Bank that is a party hereto on the Effective Date) or at any time after the
effective date of the relevant Assignment and Assumption Agreement (with respect
to any Bank that becomes a party hereto after the Effective Date pursuant to
Section 3.04 or 12.04), the unsecured senior debt rating (or shadow rating as
reflected in a letter) of such Bank or its parent shall be downgraded by Moody's
or S&P, such termination to be effective 60 days after the Borrower delivers to
such Bank a notice of termination. The Borrower shall, concurrent with such
termination, pay to such Bank the aggregate amount, if any, owing at such time
by the Borrower to such Bank under this Agreement.

            (c) In addition to any other mandatory Commitment reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Commitment of each Bank, and the Contingent
Commitment of each Part C Bank, shall each terminate in its entirety on the
Expiry Date.

            Section 3.04 Expiry Date. (a) The expiration of the Commitments and
the Contingent Commitments shall occur on November 7, 2008 (the "Expiry Date");
provided, however, that before (but not earlier than 120 days nor later than 60
days before) each anniversary of the Effective Date, the Borrower may make a
written request (an "Extension Request") to the Agent at the Notice Office that
the Expiry Date be extended by one calendar year. Such Extension Request (a copy
of which shall be forwarded by the Agent to each of the Banks) shall


                                      -14-
<PAGE>
include a certification by a senior officer of the Borrower that no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and all representations and
warranties contained herein and the other Credit Documents are true and correct
in all material aspects on and as of the date of the Extension Request (it being
understood and agreed that any representation or warranty which expressly refers
by its terms to a specified date shall be required to be true only as of such
date). If by the date occurring 30 days next succeeding the Agent's receipt of
such Extension Request, any Bank agrees thereto in writing by so indicating on
counterparts of the Extension Request and delivering such counterpart to the
Borrower, "Expiry Date" as to such Bank shall mean the November 7, occurring in
the calendar year next succeeding the Expiry Date then in effect, provided that
any failure to so notify the Borrower shall be deemed to be a disapproval by
such Bank of the Borrower's Extension Request. The Commitment of any Bank which
does not so agree, the Contingent Commitment, if any, of each Part C Bank with
respect thereto and the Contingent Commitment of such Bank if such Bank is a
Part C Bank, shall terminate upon the Expiry Date then in effect. No Bank shall
be obligated to grant any extension pursuant to this Section 3.04(a), and any
such extension shall be in the sole discretion of each Bank. The Borrower shall
pay to each Bank which does not so agree all amounts owing under its Note and
this Agreement on the effective date of the termination of such Bank's
Commitment and Contingent Commitment, if any.

            (b) If fewer than all of the Banks consent to an Extension Request
(each Bank that has not so consented being a "Declining Bank", and each other
Bank being an "Extending Bank"), the Borrower shall have the right to require
any Declining Bank to assign in full its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (i) to any one or more Extending Banks designated by the Borrower that
have offered in their returned counterpart of the Extension Request to increase
their respective Commitments (and, if any such Extending Bank is a Part C Bank,
its Contingent Commitment) in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount
of such Declining Bank's Commitment (and, if such Declining Bank is a Part C
Bank, its Contingent Commitment) (each such Extending Bank being an "Increasing
Extending Bank") and (ii) to the extent of any shortfall in the aggregate amount
of extended Commitments or extended Contingent Commitments, to any one or more
Eligible Transferees designated by the Borrower that agree to assume all of such
rights and obligations (each such Eligible Transferee being a "Replacement
Bank"), provided that (1) such Declining Bank shall have received payment of all
amounts owing under its Note and this Agreement on the effective date of such
assignment, (2) such assignment shall otherwise have occurred in compliance with
Section 12.04 including, without limitation, clauses (iii) and (iv) of
subsection (b) thereof and (3) the effective date of such assignment shall be
the date specified by the Borrower and agreed to by the Replacement Bank or
Increasing Extending Bank, as the case may be, which date shall be on or prior
to the applicable Expiry Date (without giving effect to the relevant requested
extension).

SECTION 4. PREPAYMENTS; PAYMENTS.

            Section 4.01 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
right to prepay the Loans, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part from
time to time.

            Section 4.02 Mandatory Prepayments. On each Pledged Reserve
Repayment Date, an amount equal to 100% of the Pledged Reserves Account Funds
with respect to which


                                      -15-
<PAGE>
the Borrower has delivered a Pledged Reserve Release Notice as required by
Section 8.11 shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of principal of
outstanding Loans.

            Section 4.03 Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement or any Note
shall be made to the Agent not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date
when due and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at the
Agent's Payment Office. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the
Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with
respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable
rate during such extension.

            Section 4.04 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrower
hereunder or under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other
defense. All such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any
jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein with respect to such payment (but excluding any tax imposed on or
measured by the net income of any Bank pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction
(or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) in which
the principal office or lending office of such Bank is located or in which such
Bank is organized) or any interest, penalties or similar liabilities with
respect thereto (collectively, "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed,
the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes and such additional
amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due hereunder
or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any
Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. The
Borrower shall also reimburse each Bank, upon its written request (which request
shall set forth the basis for calculation of such reimbursement), for taxes
imposed on or measured by the net income of such Bank pursuant to the laws of
the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein) in which its principal office or lending office is located or in which
such Bank is organized as it shall determine are payable by it in respect of
amounts paid to or on behalf of such Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence and
for any withholding of taxes as such Bank shall determine are payable by, or
withheld from, such Bank, in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf of
such Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid
to or on behalf of such Bank pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will
furnish to the applicable Bank within 45 days after the date the payment of any
Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of any tax receipts
available to the Borrower evidencing such payment by the Borrower. The Borrower
will indemnify and hold harmless each Bank, and reimburse each Bank upon its
written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by
such Bank.

            (b) Each of the Banks organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each of Bank party to this Agreement
as of the date of this Agreement, and on the date of the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Bank in the case of each of
the other Banks, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in
writing by the Borrower or the Agent (but only so long thereafter as such Bank
remains lawfully able to do so), provide each of the Borrower and the Agent with
an original Internal Revenue Service Form


                                      -16-
<PAGE>
W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI (in each case with all appropriate attachments) or, in the
case of any Bank that is claiming exemption from United States withholding tax
under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", Form W-8BEN (and, if such Bank delivers a Form
W-8BEN, a certificate representing that such Bank is not a "bank" for purposes
of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, certifying that such Bank is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or certifying
that such Bank is a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust). If the
forms referred to in this Section 4.04(b) that are provided by a Bank at the
time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States
interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate
shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Bank provides the
appropriate form certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes solely for the
period governed by such form. However, if, on the date of the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement pursuant to which a Bank assignee becomes a party to this
Agreement, the Bank assignor was entitled to payments under Section 4.04(a) in
respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such
date, then, to such extent (and only to such extent), the term "Taxes" shall
include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or
other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if
any, applicable with respect to such Bank assignee on such date.

            (c) For any period with respect to which any of the Banks has failed
to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other document
described in Section 4.04(b), such Bank shall not be entitled to payment or
indemnification under Section 4.04(a) with respect to Taxes imposed by reason of
such failure.

            (d) Each of the Banks hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence of any
circumstances entitling such Bank to additional amounts pursuant to this Section
4.04, such Bank shall, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts
(consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
designate a different applicable lending office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, determined by the Bank in its sole
discretion, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank in any respect.

            Section 4.05 Limitations on Sources of Payment. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or of any other Credit Document, the
obligations of the Borrower to make payments of principal and interest on the
Loans and the Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Borrower payable
solely from the Pledged Recoveries, the Pledged Premiums, the Pledged Reserves
Account Funds and the other Collateral, and none of the Agent, the Collateral
Agent, any Bank or any other Person shall be entitled to procure any money
judgment against or to levy or foreclose upon or attach any other assets or
properties of the Borrower for payment of such obligations; provided, however,
that nothing herein contained shall limit, restrict or impair the lien created
by the Security Agreement or the right of any Bank to exercise any of its rights
herein or in any of the other Credit Documents upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default or otherwise, or to bring suit and obtain a judgment against the
Borrower (recourse


                                      -17-
<PAGE>
thereon being limited as to payment of principal and interest on the Loans and
the Notes as provided in this Section 4.05).

                                      -19-
<PAGE>
            Section 6.01 Loss Threshold Incurrence Date. At or prior to the time

occurred.

            Section 6.02 Notice of Borrowing. Prior to the making of each Loan,
the Agent shall have received a Notice of Borrowing meeting the requirements of
Section 2.03.

The acceptance of the proceeds of each Credit Event shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower to each Bank that the Loss Threshold
Incurrence Date has occurred.

SECTION 7. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.

            In order to induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement, the
Borrower makes the following representations, warranties and agreements as of
the Effective Date, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Notes (it being understood and agreed that any representation
or warranty which expressly refers by its terms to a specified date shall be
required to be true and correct in all material respects only as of such date):

            Section 7.01 Corporate Status. The Borrower (i) is a duly organized
and validly existing stock insurance company in good standing under the laws of
New York, (ii) has the power and authority to own its property and assets and to
transact the business in which it is engaged and (iii) is duly qualified as a
foreign corporation and in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to qualify would not have
a material adverse effect on the business, operations, property, assets,
liabilities, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.

            Section 7.02 Corporate Power and Authority. The Borrower has the
corporate power to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each
of the Credit Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary
corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of
each of such Credit Documents. The Borrower has, or in the case of the Credit
Documents other than this Agreement, by the Effective Date will have, duly
executed and delivered each of the Credit Documents to which it is party, and
each of such Credit Documents constitutes or, in the case of each such other
Credit Document when executed and delivered, will constitute, its legal, valid
and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualifications that enforcement of the rights and remedies created hereby or
thereby is subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

            Section 7.03 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by the Borrower of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, nor
compliance by it with the terms and provisions thereof, nor the use of the
proceeds of the Loans (i) will contravene any provision of any law, statute,
rule or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality, (ii) will conflict or be inconsistent with or
result in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default under, or result in


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
the creation or imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower
pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit
agreement, loan agreement or any other agreement, contract or instrument to
which the Borrower is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets is
bound or to which it may be subject or (iii) will violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower.

            Section 7.04 Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval,
license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with (except as have been obtained or made prior to the Effective Date), or
exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, (i) the
execution, delivery and performance of any Credit Document to which the Borrower
is a party or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of
any such Credit Document.

            Section 7.05 Financial Statements; Financial Condition; Undisclosed
Liabilities; etc. (a) The balance sheet of the Borrower at December 31, 2000,
and the related statements of income and retained earnings and changes in
financial position of the Borrower for the fiscal year ended on such date, all
heretofore furnished to the Banks, present fairly the financial condition of the
Borrower at December 31, 2000, and the results of the operations of the Borrower
for the fiscal year ended on such date. All such financial statements have been
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP. Since December 31, 2000, there has been no
material adverse change in the business, operations, property, assets,
liabilities, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower,
except as may be set forth in any unaudited quarterly financial statements
prepared by the Borrower since the date of the audited financial statements or
in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A filed by Radian Group Inc. with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (all of which have heretofore been furnished
to the Banks).

            (b) Except as fully reflected in the financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 7.05(a), there are no liabilities or obligations with
respect to the Borrower of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in
aggregate, would be material to the Borrower. The Borrower does not know of any
basis for the assertion against the Borrower of any liability or obligation of
any nature whatsoever that is not fully reflected in the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 7.05(a) which, either individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to the Borrower. At
September 30, 2001, Average Annual Debt Service was $3,712,636,466.

            (c) The Borrower has delivered to each Bank its annual statements
and its financial statements as filed with the New York Insurance Department for
the years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000, and its quarterly
statements and its financial statements as filed with the New York Insurance
Department for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2001. Such annual and
quarterly statements and financial statements were prepared in accordance with
the statutory accounting principles set forth in the New York Insurance Law, and
each such annual statement is a full and true statement of all the assets and
liabilities and of


                                      -21-
<PAGE>
the condition and affairs of the Borrower as of such date and of its income and
deductions therefrom for the year ended on such date.

            Section 7.06 Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened (i) with respect
to any Credit Document or (ii) that are reasonably likely to materially and
adversely affect the business, operations, property, assets, liabilities,
prospects or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower.

            Section 7.07 True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information
(taken as a whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of
the Borrower in writing to the Banks (including without limitation all
information contained in the Credit Documents) for purposes of or in connection
with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein is, and all other
such factual information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf
of the Borrower in writing to the Banks will be, true and accurate in all
material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified
and not incomplete by omitting to state any fact necessary to make such
information (taken as a whole) not misleading at such time in light of the
circumstances under which such information was provided.

            Section 7.08 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. All proceeds of
each Loan shall be used by the Borrower only to establish and/or maintain
Permitted Reserves in the Pledged Reserves Account and/or to pay or reimburse
itself for the payment of Losses in respect of the Covered Portfolio, and no
part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used by the Borrower to purchase or
carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. Neither the making of any Loan nor the
use of the proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with the provisions
of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

            Section 7.09 Tax Returns and Payments. The Borrower has filed all
tax returns required to be filed by it and has paid all income taxes payable by
it which have become due pursuant to such tax returns and all other taxes and
assessments payable by it which have become due, other than those not yet
delinquent and except for those contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves have been established. The Borrower has paid, or has provided adequate
reserves (in the good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower) for the
payment of, all federal and state income taxes applicable for all prior fiscal
years and for the current fiscal year to the date hereof.

provision thereof shall cease to be in full force and effect, or shall cease in
any material respect to give the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Banks,

(ii) the Borrower shall otherwise default in any material respect in the due
performance or observance of any term, covenant or agreement on its part to be

            Section 10.08 Change of Control. A Change of Control shall occur;

then, and in any such event, and at any time thereafter, if any Event of Default
shall then be continuing, the Agent may or shall upon direction from the
Majority Banks, by written notice to the Borrower, take the following actions to
the extent permitted below (provided, that, if an Event of Default specified in
Section 10.05 shall occur with respect to the Borrower, the result which would
occur upon the giving of written notice to the Borrower as specified below shall
occur automatically without the giving of any such notice): if any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may declare the principal of
and any accrued interest in respect of all Loans and the Notes and all
obligations owing hereunder and thereunder to be, whereupon the same shall
become, forthwith due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

SECTION 11. THE AGENT.

            Section 11.01 Appointment. The Banks hereby designate Deutsche Bank
AG, New York Branch as Agent (for purposes of this Section 11, the term "Agent"
shall also include Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch in its capacity as
Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as specified herein
and in the other Credit Documents. Each Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes, and
each holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed
irrevocably to authorize, the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any other
instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein and to exercise such
powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent may perform any of
its duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents or employees.

            Section 11.02 Nature of Duties. The Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Security Agreement. Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors, agents
or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them
hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or
therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The duties of the Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the
Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Credit Document a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Bank or the holder of any Note; and
nothing in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Agent any obligations
in respect of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except as expressly
set forth herein or therein.

            Section 11.03 Lack of Reliance on the Agent. Independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, each Bank and the holder of each Note, to the
extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own
independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower
in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and


                                      -32-
<PAGE>
the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Borrower and, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Bank with any credit
or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession
before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Agent
shall not be responsible to any Bank or the holder of any Note for any recitals,
statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any
document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection,
collectability, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the financial condition of the Borrower or be required to make any
inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the
financial condition of the Borrower or the existence or possible existence of
any Default or Event of Default.

            Section 11.04 Certain Rights of the Agent. If the Agent shall
request instructions from the Banks with respect to any act or action (including
failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
the Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action
unless and until the Agent shall have received instructions from the Majority
Banks or all the Banks to the extent required by Section 12.11; and the Agent
shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without
limiting the foregoing, no Bank or the holder of any Note shall have any right
of action whatsoever against the Agent as a result of the Agent acting or
refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit Document in
accordance with the instructions of the Majority Banks or the Banks, as the case
may be.

            Section 11.05 Reliance. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice,
statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram,
radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by
any Person that the Agent believed to be the proper Person, and, with respect to
all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other Credit Document and
its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by the
Agent.

            Section 11.06 Indemnification. To the extent the Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, each Bank will reimburse and
indemnify the Agent for and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits and reasonable
costs, expenses and disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be
imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Agent in performing its duties
hereunder or under any other Credit Document, in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that no Bank shall
be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            Section 11.07 The Agent in Its Individual Capacity. With respect to
its obligation to make Loans under this Agreement, the Agent shall have the
rights and powers specified herein for a "Bank" and may exercise the same rights
and powers as though it was not performing the duties specified herein; and the
term "Banks," "holders of Notes" or any similar terms shall, unless the context
clearly otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The


                                      -33-
<PAGE>
Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind
of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower or any Affiliate of the
Borrower as if they were not performing the duties specified herein, and may
accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection
with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Banks.

            Section 11.08 Resignation by the Agent. (a) The Agent may resign
from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or under the
other Credit Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written
notice to the Borrower and the Banks. In the case of the resignation by the
Agent, such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor
Agent pursuant to Section 11.08(b) or 11.08(c) or as otherwise provided in
Section 11.08(d).

            (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by the Agent, the Banks
shall appoint a successor Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Borrower (it being
understood and agreed that any Bank is deemed to be acceptable to the Borrower).

            (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed within
such 15 Business Day period, the Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, shall
then appoint a successor Agent who shall serve as Agent hereunder or thereunder
until such time, if any, as the Banks appoint a successor Agent as provided
above.

            (d) If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to Section
11.08(b) or 11.08(c) by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice of
resignation was given by the Agent, the Agent may appoint any other Bank which
agrees to such appointment to act as successor Agent.

SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS.

            Section 12.01 Payment of Expenses, etc. The Borrower shall: (i)
whether or not the transactions herein contemplated are consummated, pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (a) of the Agent (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of White & Case, LLP, counsel
for the Agent) in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments
referred to herein and therein and any amendment, waiver or consent relating
hereto or thereto and (b) of the Agent and the Banks in connection with the
enforcement of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents
and instruments referred to herein and therein (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent and the Banks);
(ii) pay and hold each Bank harmless from and against any and all present and
future stamp and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing matters and
save such Bank harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to
or resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent attributable
to such Bank) to pay such taxes; and (iii) except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.05, indemnify each Bank, its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents from and hold each of them harmless against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions,
judgments, suits and


                                      -34-
<PAGE>
reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements incurred by any of them as a result
of, or arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, any
investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not such Bank is a
party thereto) related to the entering into and/or performance of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document or the use of the proceeds of any Loans hereunder
or the consummation of any transactions contemplated herein or in any other
Credit Document, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any such liabilities, obligations,
losses, etc., to the extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified).

            Section 12.02 Right of Setoff. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 4.05, in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights and
to the extent permitted by applicable law, during the continuance of an Event of
Default, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to the Borrower
or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set
off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special), and
any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Bank (including without
limitation by branches and agencies of such Bank wherever located) to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower against and on account of the Obligations
and liabilities of the Borrower to such Bank under this Agreement or under any
of the other Credit Documents, and all other claims of any nature or description
arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
irrespective of whether or not the Bank shall have made any demand hereunder and
although such Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be
contingent or unmatured, provided however that (i) except to the extent provided
in the next succeeding clause (ii), no Bank is authorized hereunder to take any
of the foregoing actions, nor shall any Bank exercise any other right of setoff
or bankers' lien or any other right now or hereafter granted under applicable
law with respect to the Pledged Reserves Account or any portion of the Pledged
Reserves Account Funds or any Collateral contained in the Pledged Reserves
Account (each of the Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Bank hereby waiving,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such right) and (ii) from and
after receipt by the Agent or the Collateral Agent of any Pledged Reserve
Release Notice, the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Bank is authorized to and
may exercise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any of such foregoing
actions or such rights only with respect to the amount of Pledged Reserves
Account Funds described in such Pledged Reserve Release Notice and the other
Collateral contained in the Pledged Reserves Account in an amount equal to the
interest and other earnings on such Pledged Reserves Account Funds.

herein, all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in

            Section 12.04 Benefit of Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective
successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the
Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Banks and, provided further, that, no
Bank may transfer or assign its rights or obligations hereunder or under any of
the other Credit Documents, except as provided in this Section 12.04, provided
further, that no Bank shall transfer, grant or assign any participation under
which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (i) except to the extent
such amendment or waiver (A) extends the final maturity of any Loan or Note
other than in accordance with Section 3.04, or reduces the rate or extends the
time of payment of interest or Fees thereon, or reduces the principal amount
thereof, or increases the Commitment of any Bank over the amount thereof then in
effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default
shall not constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of any Bank), (B)
releases any material portion of the Collateral under the Security Agreement
except as shall be otherwise provided in any Credit Document, (C) consents to
the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations
under any Credit Document, (D) amends the definition of Loss Threshold
Incurrence Date other than to increase the dollar amount or the percentage
specified therein, (E) reduces the percentage specified in the definition of
Majority Participants or (F) amends, modifies or waives any provision of this
Section 12.04 or (ii) except to the extent that a Bank may permit its Majority
Participants to approve any material written amendment, modification, waiver or
release of any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document
which would, if effected, materially adversely affect the interests of its
participants. "Majority Participants" for purposes of this Section 12.04 shall
mean, with respect to each Bank, at any time participants of such Bank
participating in at least 51% of the aggregate principal amount of Loans made by
such Bank and outstanding at such time, or if no such Loans are outstanding at
such time, participants of such Bank participating in at least 51% of the
Commitment of such Bank at such time. In the case of any such participation, the
participant shall not constitute a "Bank" hereunder and shall not have any
rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the
participant's rights against any Bank in respect of such participation to be
those set forth in the agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the
participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder
shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation, except that
the participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.07 or 4.04 of
this Agreement to the extent that such Bank would be entitled to such benefits
if the participation had not been transferred, granted or assigned.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Bank (or any Bank together
with one or more other Banks) may (and, at the direction of the Borrower
following a rating downgrade of such Bank, shall) assign all or a portion of its
Commitment (plus, if such Bank shall be a Part C Bank, such Bank's Contingent
Commitment) and related outstanding rights and obligations hereunder to one or
more Eligible Transferees, each of which assignees shall become a party to this
Agreement as a Bank and, if applicable, a Part C Bank by execution of an
Assignment and Assumption Agreement and delivery of such Assignment and
Assumption Agreement to the Borrower and the Agent, provided that (i) new Notes
will be issued to such new Bank in the stated amount of its assumed Commitment
(plus, if such Bank shall be a Part C Bank, such


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
Bank's Contingent Commitment), and to the assigning Bank in the stated amount of
the Commitment (plus, if such Bank shall be a Part C Bank, the Contingent
Commitment) if any, retained by it, upon the request of such new Bank or
assigning Bank and the surrender of the Note previously issued to the assigning
Bank (or the execution and delivery to the Borrower of an indemnity satisfactory
to the Borrower), such new Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of
Section 2.05 to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments and, if
applicable, Contingent Commitments, (ii) unless such assignment is to an
Affiliate of such assigning Bank with the same or higher unsecured senior debt
rating, and so long as no Default or Event of Default exists at the time of such
assignment, the Borrower shall have consented to such assignment, (iii) at the
time of such assignment, the new Bank or (except to the extent the new Bank is
an affiliate of the assigning Bank) its parent shall have an unsecured senior
debt rating (or shadow rating as reflected in a letter) by each of Moody's and
S&P (A) acceptable to the Borrower (if such assignment is at the direction of
the Borrower) or (B) no lower than the unsecured senior debt rating (or shadow
rating as reflected in a letter) by each of Moody's and S&P of the assigning
Bank or its parent (if such assignment is not at the direction of the Borrower),
(iv) in the case of any assignment of all or a portion of a Part C Bank's
Contingent Commitment, the new Part C Bank or its parent shall have, at the time
of such assignment, an unsecured senior debt rating (or shadow rating as
reflected in a letter) by each of Moody's and S&P of Aaa and AAA, respectively,
(v) such assignment shall not result in a downgrading of the Borrower's Rating
by Moody's or S&P from that in effect immediately prior to such assignment, (vi)
the assigning Bank shall provide notice of any such assignment to the Agent and
the Borrower and the Borrower shall provide notice of same to Moody's and S&P
and (vii) the new Bank shall deliver a legal opinion addressed to each of the
Borrower, Moody's and S&P dated the effective date of the applicable assignment
to the effect that this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws generally affecting creditor's
rights and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought
in equity or at law) as the same may be applied in the event of bankruptcy or
similar proceedings with respect to such new Bank. To the extent of any
assignment pursuant to this Section 12.04(b), the assigning Bank shall be
relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitment.
To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Bank's Commitment
and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to this Section 12.04(b) would at
the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 2.07 or
4.04 from those being charged by the respective assigning Bank prior to such
assignment, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs
(although the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of
the type described above resulting from changes in applicable law, or government
rules, regulations, orders or requests after the date of the respective
assignment).

            (c) Upon the execution and delivery of an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement in accordance with, and subject to the restrictions of, Section
12.04(b), the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents have
been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have
the rights and obligations of a "Bank" hereunder and thereunder.


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
            (d) Any Bank claiming any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.04
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions
and subject to overall policy considerations of such Bank) to designate another
lending office for its Commitment or Loans or take such other action to minimize
such amounts, as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower, provided that such
designation is made or such other action is taken on such terms that such Bank
and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage.

            (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Bank
from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support
of borrowings made by such Bank from such Federal Reserve Bank.

            (f) Each Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of any change in
the location of its applicable lending office.

            Section 12.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
the part of any Bank or the holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing
between the Borrower and any Bank or the holder of any Note shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any
other Credit Document, the rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other
Credit Document expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, powers or remedies which any Bank would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of any Bank or the holder of any Note to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

            Section 12.06 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial
statements to be furnished to the Banks pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and (b)
shall be made and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States consistently applied throughout the periods
involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in
writing by the Borrower to the Banks).

            (b) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest
is payable.

            Section 12.07 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue;
Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) This Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder and thereunder shall be
construed in accordance with and be governed by the law of the State of New
York, without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof. Any legal action
or proceeding against the Borrower with respect to this Agreement or any other
Credit Document may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or of the
United States for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and uncon-


                                      -38-
<PAGE>
ditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Borrower irrevocably
consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in
any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Borrower at its address set forth
opposite its signature below (or to such other address as the Borrower may from
time to time notify the Agent in writing), such service to become effective 30
days after such mailing. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.05, nothing
herein shall affect the right of the Agent or any Bank under this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal
proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction.

            (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in Section 12.07(a) and hereby
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

            (c) Each of the Borrower, the Agent and each of the Banks hereby
irrevocably waives its right to a jury trial in connection with any action,
proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
other Credit Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.

            Section 12.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of
counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the
Borrower and the Agent.

            Section 12.09 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective
on the date (the "Effective Date") on which the Borrower and the Banks shall
have signed a copy hereof (whether the same or different copies) and shall have
delivered the same to the Agent at its Notice Office and the conditions set
forth in Section 5 shall have been satisfied or waived by the Banks, as
evidenced by a written notice by the Agent to the Borrower confirming that the
Agreement has become effective and setting forth the Effective Date.

            Section 12.10 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several
sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this
Agreement.

            Section 12.11 Amendment or Waiver. Neither this Agreement nor any
other Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or termination is
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Majority Banks and the Agent;
provided, however, that no such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall,
without the consent of each Bank (other than any Bank that is, at the time of
the proposed extension, release, amendment, reduction or consent, a Defaulting
Bank; provided, however, that, with respect to any matter described in clause
(i) or


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

time has a Loan outstanding shall also be required) (i) extend the final
maturity of any Loan or Note other than in accordance with Section 3.04 or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon, or
reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the Commitment or percentage of
the Commitment of any Bank over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute
a change in the terms of any Commitment of any Bank), (ii) release any material
portion of the Collateral under any Security Document except as shall be
otherwise provided in any Credit Document, (iii) amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Section 12.11, (iv) reduce the percentage specified in the

            Section 12.12 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including,
without limitation, in Sections 2.07, 4.04 and 12.01 shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making and repayment of the
Loans.

            Section 12.13 Exclusions from Covered Portfolio. In the event that
any Bank (or any participant to whom such Bank has transferred, granted or
assigned any participation in its rights and obligations hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents) is, or upon the occurrence of any contingency would be,
obligated under the terms of a line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement,
letter of credit, liquidity agreement or similar agreement or arrangement to
purchase any Insured Obligation listed in a certificate delivered by the
Borrower to the Agent pursuant to Section 5.06 or 8.01(d), such Bank (or such
participant) shall promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower, that such Bank (or such participant) is or would be so
obligated to purchase such Insured Obligation. Upon delivery by the Agent to the
Borrower of any such notice with respect to an Insured Obligation, such Insured
Obligation shall, effective upon delivery of such notice by the Agent to the
Borrower, be excluded from the Covered Portfolio.

            Section 12.14 Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and each Bank
agrees to take and cause its respective Affiliates to take normal and reasonable
precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentially of all
financial information and all other information reasonably identified as
"confidential" or "secret" by the Borrower and provided to it by the Borrower or
by the Agent on the Borrower's behalf, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates
shall use such information other than in connection with or in enforcement of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, except to the extent such
information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure by the Agent or any Bank or (ii) was or becomes available
on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower, provided that
such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Borrower known
to the Agent or such Bank; provided, however, that the Agent or any Bank may
disclose such information (a) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of
any authority to which the Agent or such Bank is subject or in connection with
an examination of the Agent or such Bank by any such authority; (b) pursuant to
subpoena or other court process, provided that if not prohibited by law, the
Agent or such Bank will make reasonable efforts to provide notice to the
Borrower of the receipt of such subpoena prior to delivering confidential
material in response thereto, and the


                                      -40-

Agent and the Banks will cooperate with the Borrower in any attempt to obtain a
protective order, at the Borrower's expense, as may be reasonably requested by
the Borrower; (c) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of
any applicable law or regulation; (d) to the extent reasonably required in
connection with any litigation or proceeding with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby to which the Agent or any Bank or their respective
Affiliates may be party; (e) to the extent reasonably required in connection
with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Credit Document;
(f) to the Agent's or such Bank's independent auditors and other professional
advisors with a need to know and who agrees to keep such information
confidential to the extent required of the Agent or such Bank hereunder; and (g)
to any assignee or participant, actual or potential, provided that such Person
agrees to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the
Agent or the Bank hereunder. In addition to the foregoing, each of the Agent and
each Bank agrees that, with respect to any information provided to them by or on
behalf of the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or 8.01(g) or which is
obtained from, or derived from information provided by, any primary insurer
pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement, and in any event which the
Borrower notifies the Agent is subject to any confidentiality undertaking made
by the Borrower to any primary insurer, (1) such information shall be deemed
"confidential" for purposes of this Section 12.14, (2) such information shall
only be provided to any employee, agent, attorney or advisor on a need to know
basis and (3) each of the Agent and each Bank shall be deemed to have made the
same confidentiality undertakings as the Borrower with respect to such
information.

            Section 12.15 Payments Pro Rata. (a) The Agent agrees that promptly
after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect
of any Obligation (including, without limitation, any payment received pursuant
to Section 2.4 or 6.4 of the Security Agreement) it shall distribute such
payment to the Banks pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the
Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.

            (b) Each of the Banks agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under any Credit Document or otherwise),
which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any Loan
or Commitment Fee, the sum of which when compared to the related sum or sums
received by other Banks is in a greater proportion than the total amount of such
Obligation then owed and due to such Bank vis a vis that owed and due to all
Banks immediately prior to such receipt, then such Bank receiving such excess
payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other
Banks an interest in the Obligations of the Borrower to such Banks in such
amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all the Banks in such
amount; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess amount is
thereafter recovered from such Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

            (c) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
provisions of Sections 12.15(a) and 12.15(b) shall be subject to the express
provisions of this Agreement which require or permit differing payments to be
made to Defaulting Banks as opposed to non-Defaulting Banks.
