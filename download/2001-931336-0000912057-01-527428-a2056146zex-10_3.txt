    "ACQUIRED COMPANY" shall have the meaning set forth in the first recital
above.

    "ACQUISITION" shall mean the acquisition of the Acquired Company and its
Subsidiaries by the Borrower and/or one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries
pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Documents.

    "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT" shall have the meaning set forth in the preamble to
this Agreement and any successors in such capacity.

    "AFFILIATE" shall mean as to any Person, any Person that directly or
indirectly controls, or is under common control with, or is controlled by, such
Person and, if such Person is an individual, any member of the immediate family
(including parents, spouse, children and siblings) of such individual and any
trust whose principal beneficiary is such individual or one or more members of
such immediate family and any Person who is controlled by any such member or
trust. As used in this definition, "control" (including, with its correlative
meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") shall mean
possession, directly or indirectly, of power to direct or cause the direction of
management or policies (whether through ownership of securities or partnership
or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise); PROVIDED that, in any
event, any Person that owns directly or indirectly securities having 10% or more
of the voting power for the election of directors or other governing body of a
corporation or 10% or more of the partnership or other ownership interests of
any other Person (other than as a limited partner of such other Person) will be
deemed to control such corporation or other Person. Notwithstanding the

customers or other banks; and "FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE" shall mean, for any

    Percentage of LOC Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving
    Commitment and (ii) with regard to the Lenders collectively, the sum of the
    aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Loans PLUS Swingline Loans PLUS
    LOC Obligations shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. For
    purposes hereof, the aggregate amount available hereunder shall be EIGHT
    HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($800,000,000) (as such aggregate maximum amount may
    be reduced from time to time as provided in Section 2.7, the "REVOLVING
    COMMITTED AMOUNT"). Revolving Loans may consist of Alternate Base Rate Loans
    or LIBOR Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, as the Borrower may request,
    and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.
    LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made

    by each Lender at its LIBOR Lending Office and Alternate Base Rate Loans at
    its Domestic Lending Office.

         (b) REVOLVING LOAN BORROWINGS.

              (i) NOTICE OF BORROWING. The Borrower shall request a Revolving
         Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephone notice promptly
         confirmed in writing which confirmation may be by fax) to the
         Administrative Agent not later than 1:30 P.M. (Charlotte, North
         Carolina time) on the date of the requested borrowing in the case of
         Alternate Base Rate Loans, and on the third Business Day prior to the
         date of the requested borrowing in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans. Each
         such request for borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A)
         that a Revolving Loan is requested, (B) the date of the requested
         borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the aggregate principal
         amount to be borrowed, (D) whether the borrowing shall be comprised of
         Alternate Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Rate Loans or a combination thereof,
         and if LIBOR Rate Loans are requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor.
         A form of Notice of Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") is attached
         hereto as SCHEDULE 2.1(b)(i). If the Borrower shall fail to specify in
         any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable Interest Period in the
         case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request for an Interest Period of one month, or (II) the type of
         Revolving Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request for an Alternate Base Rate Loan hereunder. The Administrative
         Agent shall give notice to each Lender promptly upon receipt of each
         Notice of Borrowing, the contents thereof and each such Lender's share
         thereof.

              (ii) ADVANCES. Each Lender will make its Revolving Commitment
         Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the office of
         the Administrative Agent specified in Section 9.2, or at such other
         office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, by 4:00
         P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date specified in the
         applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately
         available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made
         available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent by crediting the
         account of the Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate
         of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the
         Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

         (c) REPAYMENT. The principal amount of all Revolving Loans shall be due
    and payable in full on the Revolving Commitment Termination Date.

         (d) REVOLVING NOTES. Each Lender's Revolving Loans shall be evidenced
    by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to such Lender in the
    original amount of such Lender's Revolving Commitment and in substantially
    the form of SCHEDULE 2.1(d).

    SECTION 2.2   SWINGLINE LOAN SUBFACILITY.

         (a) SWINGLINE COMMITMENT. During the Commitment Period, subject to the
    terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender, in its individual
    capacity, agrees to make certain revolving credit loans to the Borrower
    (each a "SWINGLINE LOAN" and, collectively, the "SWINGLINE LOANS") for the
    purposes hereinafter set forth; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, (i) the aggregate amount
    of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed ONE HUNDRED
    MILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000) (the "SWINGLINE COMMITTED AMOUNT"), and (ii)
    the sum of the aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Loans PLUS
    Swingline Loans PLUS LOC Obligations shall not exceed the Revolving
    Committed Amount. Swingline Loans hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed in
    accordance with the provisions hereof.

         (b) SWINGLINE LOAN BORROWINGS.

              (i) NOTICE OF BORROWING AND DISBURSEMENT. The Swingline Lender
         will make Swingline Loans available to the Borrower on any Business Day
         upon request made by the Borrower not later than 4:00 P.M. (Charlotte,
         North Carolina time) on such Business Day. A request for a Swingline
         Loan borrowing shall be made in the form of a Notice of Borrowing with
         appropriate modifications. Swingline Loan borrowings hereunder shall be
         made in minimum amounts of $100,000 and integral multiples of $100,000
         in excess thereof.

              (ii) REPAYMENT OF SWINGLINE LOANS. Each Swingline Loan borrowing
         shall be due and payable on or before the fifth Business Day after the
         date on which such Swingline Loan borrowing is made or such later date
         to which the Swingline Lender and Borrower agree and, in any event, on
         the Maturity Date. The Swingline Lender may, at any time, in its sole
         discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by way of a Revolving
         Loan borrowing, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed to have
         requested a Revolving Loan borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate
         Base Rate Loans in the amount of such Swingline Loans; PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER, that, in the following circumstances, any such demand shall
         also be deemed to have been given one Business Day prior to each of (i)
         the Maturity Date, (ii) the occurrence of any Event of Default
         described in Section 7.1(e), (iii) upon acceleration of the Credit
         Party Obligations hereunder, whether on account of an Event of Default
         described in Section 7.1(e) or any other Event of Default, and (iv) the
         exercise of remedies in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2
         hereof (each such Revolving Loan borrowing made on account of any such
         deemed request therefor as provided herein being hereinafter referred
         to as a "MANDATORY BORROWING"). Each Lender with a Revolving Commitment
         hereby irrevocably agrees to make such Revolving Loans promptly upon
         any such request or deemed request on account of each Mandatory
         Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding
         sentence and on the same such date NOTWITHSTANDING (I) the amount of
         Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for
         borrowings of Revolving Loans otherwise

                                       33
<Page>

         required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions specified in Section
         4.2 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default or an Event of Default
         then exists, (IV) failure of any such request or deemed request for
         Revolving Loans to be made by the time otherwise required in Section
         2.1(b)(i), (V) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, or (VI) any
         reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount or termination of the
         Revolving Commitments immediately prior to such Mandatory Borrowing or
         contemporaneously therewith. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing
         cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above
         (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a
         proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower),
         then each Lender with a Revolving Commitment hereby agrees that it
         shall forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would
         otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from
         the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the
         Swingline Lender such participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans
         as shall be necessary to cause each such Lender to share in such
         Swingline Loans ratably based upon its respective Revolving Commitment
         Percentage (determined before giving effect to any termination of the
         Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2), PROVIDED that (A) all interest
         payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the
         Swingline Lender until the date as of which the respective
         participation is purchased, and (B) at the time any purchase of
         participations pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the
         purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to the Swingline Lender
         interest on the principal amount of such participation purchased for
         each day from and including the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing
         would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for
         such participation, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
         Business Days of the date of the Mandatory Borrowing, the Federal Funds
         Effective Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base
         Rate.

              (c) INTEREST ON SWINGLINE LOANS. Subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.10(b), Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a per annum
         rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Alternate Base Rate PLUS the
         Applicable Percentage for Revolving Loans that are Alternate Base Rate
         Loans or (ii) a rate agreed upon by the Swingline Lender and the
         Borrower. Interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable in arrears on
         each Interest Payment Date.

              (d) SWINGLINE NOTE. The Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by a
         duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender
         in the original amount of the Swingline Committed Amount and
         substantially in the form of SCHEDULE 2.2(d).

    SECTION 2.3   LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

              (a) ISSUANCE. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and of
         the LOC Documents, if any, and any other terms and conditions which the
         Issuing Lender may reasonably require, during the Commitment Period the
         Issuing Lender shall issue, and the Lenders having a Revolving
         Commitment shall participate in, Letters of Credit for the

                                       34
<Page>

         account of the Borrower from time to time upon request in a form
         acceptable to the Issuing Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the
         aggregate amount of LOC Obligations shall not at any time exceed ONE
         HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ($150,000,000) (the "LOC COMMITTED
         AMOUNT"), (ii) the sum of the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans PLUS
         Swingline Loans PLUS LOC Obligations shall not at any time exceed the
         Revolving Committed Amount, (iii) all Letters of Credit shall be
         denominated in Dollars and (iv) Letters of Credit shall be issued for
         lawful corporate purposes and may be issued as standby letters of
         credit, including in connection with workers' compensation and other
         insurance programs, and trade letters of credit. Except as otherwise
         expressly agreed upon by the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative
         Agent, no Letter of Credit shall have an original expiry date more than
         twelve (12) months from the date of issuance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, so
         long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
         and subject to the other terms and conditions to the issuance of
         Letters of Credit hereunder, the expiry dates of Letters of Credit may
         be extended annually or periodically from time to time on the request
         of the Borrower or by operation of the terms of the applicable Letter
         of Credit to a date not more than twelve (12) months from the date of
         extension; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no Letter of Credit, as originally
         issued or as extended, shall have an expiry date extending beyond the
         date which is five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Commitment
         Termination Date. Each Letter of Credit shall comply with the related
         LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry date of each Letter of Credit
         shall be a Business Day. First Union shall be the Issuing Lender on all
         Letters of Credit issued on or after the Funding Date. All currently
         outstanding letters of credit issued by First Union for the account of
         the Borrower, its Subsidiaries, or any predecessor-in-interest of any
         of them, shall, as of the Funding Date, be considered Letters of Credit
         issued and subject to the terms of this Credit Agreement.

              (b) NOTICE AND REPORTS. The request for the issuance of a Letter
         of Credit shall be submitted to the Issuing Lender at least three (3)
         Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance. The Issuing
         Lender will promptly upon request provide to the Administrative Agent
         for dissemination to the Lenders a detailed report specifying the
         Letters of Credit which are then issued and outstanding and any
         activity with respect thereto which may have occurred since the date of
         any prior report, and including therein, among other things, the
         account party, the beneficiary, the face amount, expiry date as well as
         any payments or expirations which may have occurred. The Issuing Lender
         will further provide to the Administrative Agent promptly upon request
         copies of the Letters of Credit. The Issuing Lender will provide to the
         Administrative Agent promptly upon request a summary report of the
         nature and extent of LOC Obligations then outstanding.

              (c) PARTICIPATIONS. Each Lender with a Revolving Commitment, upon
         issuance of a Letter of Credit (other than a Letter of Credit in an
         original face amount of less than $1,000,000), shall be deemed to have
         purchased without recourse a risk participation from the Issuing Lender
         in such Letter of Credit and the obligations arising thereunder and any
         collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal to its LOC
         Commitment Percentage of the obligations under such Letter of Credit
         and shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as
         primary obligor and not as surety, and be obligated to pay to the
         Issuing Lender therefor and discharge when due, its LOC

                                       35
<Page>

         Commitment Percentage of the obligations arising under such Letter of
         Credit, unless the Issuing Lender acted with gross negligence or
         willful misconduct in issuing such Letter of Credit. Without limiting
         the scope and nature of each Lender's participation in any Letter of
         Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed
         as required hereunder or under any LOC Document, each such Lender shall
         pay to the Issuing Lender its LOC Commitment Percentage of such
         unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the day of notification by
         the Issuing Lender of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the
         provisions of subsection (d) below if such notice is received at or
         before 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), otherwise such
         payment shall be made at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North
         Carolina time) on the Business Day next succeeding the day such notice
         is received. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing
         Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
         the occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any other
         occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or
         otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the
         Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as
         hereinafter provided.

              (d) REIMBURSEMENT. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
         Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender
         on the day of drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the
         proceeds of a Swingline Loan or Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or
         otherwise) in same day funds as provided herein or in the LOC
         Documents. If the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender
         as provided herein, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear
         interest at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the
         Applicable Percentage. Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the
         Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent of its intent to otherwise
         reimburse the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
         requested a Swingline Loan, or if and to the extent Swingline Loans
         shall not be available, a Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing
         as provided in subsection (e) below, the proceeds of which will be used
         to satisfy the reimbursement obligations. The Borrower's reimbursement
         obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under all
         circumstances irrespective of any rights of set-off, counterclaim or
         defense to payment the Borrower may claim or have against the Issuing
         Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the beneficiary of the
         Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including without
         limitation any defense based on any failure of the Borrower to receive
         consideration or the legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability
         of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender will promptly notify the
         other Lenders of the amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each Lender
         shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds, the
         amount of such Lender's LOC Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed
         drawing, unless the Issuing Lender acted with gross negligence or
         willful misconduct in issuing such Letter of Credit. Such payment shall
         be made on the day such notice is received by such Lender from the
         Issuing Lender if such notice is received at or before 2:00 P.M.
         (Charlotte, North Carolina time), otherwise such payment shall be made
         at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the
         Business Day next succeeding the day such notice is received. If such
         Lender does not pay such amount to the Issuing

                                       36
<Page>

         Lender in full upon such request, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to
         the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender interest
         on the unpaid amount during the period from the date of such drawing
         until such Lender pays such amount to the Issuing Lender in full at a
         rate per annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the
         date of drawing, the Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at a
         rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation to make
         such payment to the Issuing Lender, and the right of the Issuing Lender
         to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be
         affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the
         termination of this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the
         existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the
         Credit Party Obligations hereunder and shall be made without any
         offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

              (e) REPAYMENT WITH REVOLVING LOANS. On any day on which the
         Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, (i) a
         Swingline Loan borrowing to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of
         Credit, the Swingline Lender shall make the Swingline Loan advance
         pursuant to the terms of the request or deemed request in accordance
         with the provisions for Swingline Loan advances hereunder, or (ii) a
         Revolving Loan to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the
         Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving
         Loan has been requested or deemed requested in connection with a
         drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan
         borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans (each such
         borrowing, a "MANDATORY BORROWING") shall be immediately made (without
         giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section
         7.2) PRO RATA based on each Lender's respective Revolving Commitment
         Percentage (determined before giving effect to any termination of the
         Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2) and in the case of both clauses
         (i) and (ii) the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Issuing
         Lender for application to the respective LOC Obligations. Each Lender
         hereby irrevocably agrees to make such Revolving Loans immediately upon
         any such request or deemed request on account of each Mandatory
         Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding
         sentence and on the same such date NOTWITHSTANDING (i) the amount of
         Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for
         borrowings of Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii)
         whether any conditions specified in Section 4.2 are then satisfied,
         (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv)
         failure for any such request or deemed request for Revolving Loan to be
         made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.1(b), (v) the date of
         such Mandatory Borrowing, or (vi) any reduction in the Revolving
         Committed Amount after any such Letter of Credit may have been drawn
         upon. In the event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason
         be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without
         limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the
         Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each such Lender
         hereby agrees that it shall forthwith fund (as of the date the
         Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any
         payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to
         such purchase) its Participation Interests in the outstanding LOC
         Obligations; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that in the event any Lender shall fail
         to fund its Participation Interest on the day the Mandatory Borrowing
         would otherwise have occurred, then the amount of such Lender's
         unfunded

                                       37
<Page>

         Participation Interest therein shall bear interest payable to the
         Issuing Lender upon demand, at the rate equal to, if paid within two
         (2) Business Days of such date, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and
         thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

              (f) DESIGNATION OF SUBSIDIARIES AS ACCOUNT PARTIES.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
         including without limitation Section 2.3(a), a Letter of Credit issued
         hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter of
         Credit is issued for the account of a Subsidiary of the Borrower,
         provided that notwithstanding such statement, the Borrower shall be the
         actual account party for all purposes of this Agreement for such Letter
         of Credit and such statement shall not affect the Borrower's
         reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of
         Credit.

    SECTION 2.6   FEES.

            (a) COMMITMENT FEE. In consideration of the Commitments, the
    Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit
    of the Lenders a commitment fee (the "COMMITMENT FEE") in an amount equal to
    (1) with respect to the Tranche B Term Loan Committed Amount, one-half
    percent (0.5%) per annum from the Closing Date until the Funding Date, and
    (2) with respect to the Tranche A Term Loan Committed Amount and the
    Revolving Committed Amount, from and after (A) the Closing Date until
    October 31, 2001, one-eighth percent (.125%) per annum on the Tranche A Term
    Loan Committed Amount and the Revolving Committed Amount and (B) November 1,
    2001 until the Funding Date, one-quarter percent (.25%) per annum. After the
    Funding Date the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
    ratable benefit of the Lenders holding a Revolving Commitment, a Commitment
    Fee equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the average daily unused
    amount of the Revolving Committed Amount. For purposes of computing the
    Commitment Fee hereunder, (i) LOC Obligations shall be considered usage
    under the aggregate Revolving Committed Amount and (ii) Swingline Loans
    shall not be considered usage under the aggregate Revolving Committed Amount
    unless and until other Lenders having a Revolving Commitment purchase
    Participation Interests in such Swingline Loans pursuant to Section
    2.2(b)(ii). The Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the
    15th day following the last day of each calendar quarter for the prior
    calendar quarter and upon termination of the Revolving Commitments and the
    funding of the Term Loans.

            (b) LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. In consideration of the LOC Commitments,
    the Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender a fee (the "LETTER OF
    CREDIT FEE") equal to

                                       41
<Page>

    the Applicable Percentage per annum on the average daily maximum amount
    available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit (as such amount may be
    increased subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(b)) from the date of
    issuance (or in the case of Letters of Credit outstanding on the Closing
    Date, from the Closing Date) to the date of expiration. In addition to such
    Letter of Credit Fee, the Issuing Lender may charge, and retain for its own
    account without sharing by the other Lenders, an additional facing fee of
    one-eighth of one percent (1/8%) per annum on the average daily maximum
    amount available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit issued by it.
    The Issuing Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent for
    the ratable benefit of the Lenders (including the Issuing Lender) the Letter
    of Credit Fee. The Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable quarterly in
    arrears on the 15th day following the last day of each calendar quarter for
    the prior calendar quarter.

            (c) ISSUING LENDER FEES. In addition to the Letter of Credit Fees
    payable pursuant to subsection (b) above, the Borrower shall pay to the
    Issuing Lender for its own account without sharing by the other Lenders the
    reasonable and customary charges from time to time of the Issuing Lender
    with respect to the amendment, transfer, administration, cancellation and
    conversion of, and drawings under, such Letters of Credit (collectively, the
    "ISSUING LENDER FEES").

            (d) ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agents the
    annual administrative fee as described in the Fee Letter.

    SECTION 2.7   REDUCTION OF THE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS.

            (a) VOLUNTARY REDUCTIONS. The Borrower shall have the right to
    terminate or permanently reduce the unused portion of the Revolving
    Committed Amount at any time or from time to time upon not less than one
    Business Day prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall notify
    the Lenders thereof as soon as practicable) of each such termination or
    reduction, which notice shall specify the effective date thereof and the
    amount of any such reduction which shall be in a minimum amount of
    $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall be
    irrevocable and effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent; PROVIDED
    that no such reduction or termination shall be permitted if after giving
    effect thereto, and to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans made on the
    effective date thereof, the sum of the then outstanding aggregate principal
    amount of the Revolving Loans PLUS Swingline Loans PLUS LOC Obligations
    would exceed the Revolving Committed Amount.

         (b) MATURITY DATE. The Revolving Commitment, the LOC Commitment and the
    Swingline Commitment shall automatically terminate on the Revolving
    Commitment Termination Date.

    SECTION 2.8   PREPAYMENTS.

         (a) OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay
    Loans in whole or in part from time to time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i)
    each partial prepayment

                                       42
<Page>

    of Loans (other than Swingline Loans) shall be in a minimum principal amount
    of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and
    (ii) each prepayment of Swingline Loans shall be in a minimum principal
    amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. The
    Borrower shall give irrevocable written notice (or telephone notice promptly
    confirmed in writing which confirmation may be by fax) of any such voluntary
    prepayment to the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the Lenders
    thereof as soon as practicable) not later than 1:30 P.M. (Charlotte, North
    Carolina time) on the Business Day prior to the date of the requested
    prepayment in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and on the third
    Business Day prior to the date of the requested prepayment in the case of
    LIBOR Rate Loans. Amounts prepaid under this Section 2.8(a) shall be applied
    first pro rata to the Tranche A Term Loan (ratably to the remaining
    principal installments thereof) and the Tranche B Term Loan (ratably to the
    remaining principal installments thereof) (provided, however, promptly upon
    notification thereof, one or more holders of the Tranche B Term Loan may
    decline to accept such payment to the extent there are sufficient amounts
    under the Tranche A Term Loan outstanding to be paid with such prepayment,
    in which case, such declined payments shall be allocated pro rata among the
    Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan held by Lenders accepting
    such payments) and then (after the Tranche A Term Loan and Tranche B Term
    Loan have been paid in full) to the Revolving Loans. Subject to the
    foregoing terms, amounts prepaid under this Section 2.8(a) shall be applied
    first to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct
    order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section
    2.8(a) shall be subject to Section 2.18, but otherwise without premium or
    penalty. Interest on the principal amount prepaid shall be payable on the
    date of such prepayment. Amounts prepaid on the Swingline Loans and the
    Revolving Loans may be reborrowed in accordance with the terms hereof.
    Amounts prepaid on the Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan may
    not be reborrowed.

             (b) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

                 (i) REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT. If at any time after the
             Funding Date, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of
             outstanding Revolving Loans PLUS Swingline Loans PLUS LOC
             Obligations shall exceed the Revolving Committed Amount, the
             Borrower immediately shall prepay the Revolving Loans and (after
             all Revolving Loans have been repaid) cash collateralize the LOC
             Obligations, in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess (such
             prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                 (ii) ASSET DISPOSITIONS. Promptly following any Asset
             Disposition in excess of $20,000,000 in any fiscal year (provided,
             however, that with respect to the first eighteen (18) month period
             following the Funding Date, the full amount of any Asset
             Disposition shall be subject to the prepayment requirements set
             forth below), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate
             amount equal to (A) during any fiscal quarter immediately following
             a fiscal quarter in which the Borrower's Leverage Ratio is less
             than 3.00 to 1.0, 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds derived from all
             such Asset Dispositions, and (B) at any other time, 100% of the

                                       43
<Page>

             Net Cash Proceeds derived from all such Asset Dispositions (such
             prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi) below);
             provided, however, that such Net Cash Proceeds shall not be
             required to be so applied to the extent (1) the Borrower delivers
             to the Administrative Agent a certificate stating that it intends
             to use such Net Cash Proceeds to acquire fixed or capital assets in
             replacement of the disposed assets, (2) such acquisition is
             committed to within 180 days of receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds
             and (3) such acquisition is consummated within 270 days of receipt
             of such Net Cash Proceeds, it being expressly agreed that any Net
             Cash Proceeds not so reinvested shall be applied to repay the Loans
             immediately thereafter.

                 (iii) ISSUANCES. Immediately upon receipt by any Credit Party
             of proceeds from (A) any Debt Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay
             the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to seventy-five percent
             (75%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance (such
             prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi) below) or (B)
             any Equity Issuance in excess of $10,000,000 in any fiscal year,
             the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to
             fifty percent (50%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity
             Issuance (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi)
             below); provided, however, with respect to both (A) and (B) above,
             to the extent the Leverage Ratio was less than or equal to 3.0 to
             1.0 as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, no prepayments
             shall be required hereunder.

                 (iv) RECOVERY EVENT. To the extent of cash proceeds received in
             connection with a Recovery Event which are in excess of $10,000,000
             in the aggregate and which are not applied to repair, replace or
             relocate damaged property or to purchase or acquire fixed or
             capital assets in replacement of the assets lost or destroyed
             within 270 days (or 360 days, in the case of improvements to real
             property) of the receipt of such cash proceeds, the Borrower shall
             prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to one hundred
             percent (100%) of such cash proceeds (such prepayment to be applied
             as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                 (v) EXCESS CASH FLOW. Within 90 days after the end of each
             fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31,
             2002), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an amount equal to
             (x) if the Leverage Ratio of the Borrower at the end of such fiscal
             year was greater than 3.0 to 1.0, fifty percent (50%) of the Excess
             Cash Flow earned during such fiscal year and (y) if such Leverage
             Ratio was less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0, no prepayments shall be
             required with respect to the Excess Cash Flow earned during such
             fiscal year (such prepayments, if any, to be applied as set forth
             in clause (vi) below).

                 (vi) APPLICATION OF MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. All amounts required
             to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.8(b) shall be applied as
             follows: (A) with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant to
             Section 2.8(b)(i), to the Revolving Loans and then (after all
             Revolving Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral account in
             respect of LOC Obligations, (B) with respect to all amounts prepaid

                                       44
<Page>

             pursuant to Sections 2.8(b)(ii) through (v), (1) first, pro rata to
             the Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan (ratably to the
             remaining principal installments thereof); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
             promptly upon notification thereof, one or more holders of the
             Tranche B Term Loan may decline to accept a mandatory prepayment to
             the extent there are sufficient amounts under the Tranche A Term
             Loan outstanding to be paid with such prepayment, in which case,
             such declined payments shall be allocated pro rata among the
             Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan held by Lenders
             accepting such prepayments, and (2) second, to the Revolving Loans
             with a corresponding permanent pro rata reduction of the Revolving
             Commitments and (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid) to a
             cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations. Within the
             parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments shall
             be applied first to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then to LIBOR
             Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All
             prepayments under this Section 2.8(b) shall be subject to Section
             2.18 and be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid
             through the date of prepayment.

    SECTION 2.9   MINIMUM BORROWING AMOUNTS AND PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF TRANCHES.

            (a) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan (other than Swingline Loans)
    borrowing shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and whole multiples of
    $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

            (b) Each LIBOR Rate Loan borrowing shall be in a minimum amount of
    $10,000,000 and whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

            (c) All borrowings, payments and prepayments in respect of Revolving
    Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so
    that after giving effect thereto the aggregate principal amount of the
    Revolving Loans comprising any Tranche shall either be zero or shall not be
    less than $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

    SECTION 2.10   INTEREST; INTEREST PAYMENT DATES.

            (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(b), all Loans (other
    than Swingline Loans) shall bear interest as follows:

                 (i) ALTERNATE BASE RATE LOANS. During such periods as Loans
             shall be comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans, each such
             Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate
             equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate PLUS the Applicable
             Percentage; and

                 (ii) LIBOR RATE LOANS. During such periods as Loans shall be
             comprised of LIBOR Rate Loans, each such LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear
             interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of the applicable
             LIBOR Rate PLUS the Applicable Percentage.

                                       45
<Page>

             (b) Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
    Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on
    the Loans, and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit
    Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2%
    greater than the applicable rate (including the Applicable Percentage) then
    in effect or, if no rate is then in effect, at a per annum rate 2% greater
    than the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage and the Letter
    of Credit Fees shall be increased by 2% per annum.

             (c) Interest on Loans shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
    Payment Date, subject to Section 2.13; provided that (i) interest owing
    under Section 2.10(b) shall be payable on demand, (ii) interest owing in
    connection with any amounts repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
    of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) interest owing on LIBOR Loans
    which are converted pursuant to Section 2.11, shall be payable on the date
    of such conversion.

    SECTION 2.11   CONVERSION OPTIONS.

             (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Alternate
    Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans by giving irrevocable written notice (or
    telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing which confirmation may be by
    fax) to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:30 P.M. (Charlotte, North
    Carolina time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested
    conversion (a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION/EXTENSION"). A form of Notice of
    Conversion/Extension is attached as SCHEDULE 2.11. If the date upon which an
    Alternate Base Rate Loan is to be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan is not a
    Business Day, then such conversion shall be made on the next succeeding
    Business Day and during the period from such last day of an Interest Period
    to such succeeding Business Day such Loan shall bear interest as if it were
    an Alternate Base Rate Loan. All or any part of outstanding Alternate Base
    Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein, PROVIDED that (i) no Loan
    may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default
    has occurred and is continuing and (ii) partial conversions shall be in an
    aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000
    in excess thereof.

         (b) Any LIBOR Rate Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration
    of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Borrower
    with the notice provisions contained in Section 2.11(a); PROVIDED, that no
    LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of
    Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case such Loan shall be
    automatically converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the
    applicable Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower shall fail
    to give timely notice of an election to continue a LIBOR Rate Loan, or the
    continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans is not permitted hereunder, such LIBOR Rate
    Loans shall be automatically converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans at the
    end of the applicable Interest Period with respect thereto.

                                       46

    SECTION 2.12   COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

             (a) Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate Base Rate
    Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of
    365 days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days elapsed. All other
    fees, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be calculated
    on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed. The
    Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and
    the Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the
    determination thereof. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting
    from a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the
    opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base
    Rate shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
    practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and
    the amount of each such change.

             (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
    Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
    binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.
    The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to
    the Borrower a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative
    Agent in determining any interest rate.

             (c) It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to
    conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from
    time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Credit
    Parties are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall
    override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter
    arising and whether written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or
    contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the
    maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted
    for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or
    otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under
    applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit
    Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in
    excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be
    subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such interest shall be
    automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under
    applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new
    document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is
    characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would,
    apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount,
    an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest
    shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount
    owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the
    Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which
    would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans.
    The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced
    by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any
    interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the
    Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the
    event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders
    with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,

                                       47
<Page>

    be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated
    term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of
    interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum
    nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.

    SECTION 2.13   PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS.

    (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction of the Revolving
Commitments shall be made PRO RATA according to the respective Commitment
Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment under this Agreement or any Note shall
be applied, first, to any fees then due and owing by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.6, second, to interest then due and owing in respect of the Notes of
the Borrower and, third, to principal then due and owing hereunder and under the
Notes of the Borrower. Each payment on account of any fees pursuant to Section
2.6 shall be made PRO RATA in accordance with the respective amounts due and
owing (except as to the portion of the Letter of Credit retained by the Issuing
Lender, the Issuing Lender Fees and fees payable to the Agents). Each payment
(other than prepayments) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest
on the Revolving Loans, the Tranche A Term Loan and/or the Tranche B Term Loan
shall be made PRO RATA according to the respective amounts due and owing first
to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in the direct order of
Interest Period maturities. Each optional prepayment on account of principal of
the Loans shall be applied as set forth in Section 2.8(a); PROVIDED, that
prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.16 shall be applied in accordance with
such section. Each mandatory prepayment on account of principal of the Loans
shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.8(b). All payments (including
prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal, interest and
fees shall be made without defense, set-off or counterclaim (except as provided
in Section 2.19(b)) and shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders at the Administrative Agent's office specified on
SCHEDULE 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00
P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. The Administrative
Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto promptly
upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than
payments on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be
payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a
LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the
maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless
the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another
calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day.

    (b) ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party
Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents
or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

                                       48
<Page>

         FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
    expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of the
    Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders
    under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the
    Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the
    terms of the Security Documents;

         SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent;

         THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
    expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of each
    of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit
    Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to
    such Lender;

         FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
    consisting of accrued fees and interest;

         FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Credit
    Party Obligations (including the payment or cash collateralization of the
    outstanding LOC Obligations);

         SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other obligations
    which shall have become due and payable under the Credit Documents or
    otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above;
    and

         SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be
    lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

    In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
    numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
    succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal
    to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding
    Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then
    outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts available to be applied
    pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above; and (iii)
    to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause
    "FIFTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of
    outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the
    Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to
    reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time for any drawings under such
    Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of
    Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH"
    and "SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 2.13(b).

    SECTION 2.14   NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

             (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
    writing by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be made by such Lender
    (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not
    intend to make the proceeds of such

                                       49
<Page>

    Loan available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may
    assume that such Lender has made such proceeds available to the
    Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may in
    reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available
    to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not
    in fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
    shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such
    Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the
    Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will
    promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such
    corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
    shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the
    case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day
    from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the
    Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount
    is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i)
    from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing
    pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the Federal
    Funds Effective Rate.

             (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
    writing by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any payment is due from
    it hereunder (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that the
    Borrower does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
    assume that the Borrower has made such payment when due, and the
    Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be
    required to) make available to each Lender on such payment date an amount
    equal to the portion of such assumed payment to which such Lender is
    entitled hereunder, and if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment to
    the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, repay to the
    Administrative Agent the amount made available to such Lender. If such
    amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent on a date after the date such
    amount was made available to such Lender, such Lender shall pay to the
    Administrative Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect of each
    day from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent
    to such Lender to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative
    Agent at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

         (c) A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to the Borrower
    or any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.14 shall
    be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

    SECTION 2.15   INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (i) the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for
ascertaining LIBOR for an Interest Period, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall
reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent
manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the Borrower has requested
be outstanding as a LIBOR Tranche

                                       50
<Page>

during an Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
telephone notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower,
and the Lenders at least two Business Days prior to the first day of such
Interest Period. Unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative
Agent upon receipt of such telephone notice that it wishes to rescind or modify
its request regarding such LIBOR Rate Loans, any Loans that were requested to be
made as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans and any
Loans that were requested to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans
shall be converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until any such notice has
been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as,
continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so
affected.

    SECTION 2.16 ILLEGALITY.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the adoption of or
any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender shall make it
unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make or maintain LIBOR
Rate Loans as contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain in the interbank
eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the funds with which to make
such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make LIBOR
Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such shall forthwith be suspended
until the Administrative Agent shall give notice that the condition or situation
which gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist, and (c) such Lender's
Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall be converted on the
last day of the Interest Period for such Loans or within such earlier period as
required by law as Alternate Base Rate Loans. The Borrower hereby agrees
promptly to pay any Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender for actual and direct costs (but not including
anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender in making any repayment
in accordance with this Section including, but not limited to, any interest or
fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make
or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through the
Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including
reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize
any amounts which may otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any
additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its
sole discretion to be material.

    SECTION 2.17 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

            (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in
    the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with
    any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
    central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date
    hereof:

                (i) shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever
         with respect to any Letter of Credit or any application relating
         thereto, any LIBOR

                                       51
<Page>

         Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of
         payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the
         rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);

                (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
         advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other
         acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not
         otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or

                (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

    and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
    Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or the Letters of Credit or
    to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or under any Note and such
    Lender's costs have increased with respect to other customers under similar
    circumstances, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such
    Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such
    Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such
    Lender reasonably deems to be material as determined by such Lender with
    respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans or Letters of Credit. A certificate as to
    any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such
    Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be
    conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use
    reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic
    Lending Office or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to
    minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this
    paragraph of this Section; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such efforts shall not
    cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or
    regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender to be material.

            (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption
    of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in
    the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or
    any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive
    regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any
    central bank or Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof
    does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
    Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations
    hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could
    have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
    consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to
    capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be
    material, and such Lender has experienced such effect with respect to other
    customers under similar circumstances, then from time to time, within
    fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to
    such Lender such additional amount as shall be certified by such Lender as
    being required to compensate it for such reduction. Such a certificate as to
    any additional amounts payable under this Section submitted by a Lender
    (which certificate shall include a description of the basis

                                       52
<Page>

    for the computation), through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
    shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            (c) The agreements in this Section 2.17 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

    SECTION 2.18 INDEMNITY.

    The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold such Lender
harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment of the principal
amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in accordance with the terms
hereof, (b) default by the Borrower in accepting a borrowing after the Borrower
has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, (c) default by the
Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in
accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a
prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is not the last
day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, in each case including, but not
limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by
such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Loans
hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the
Borrower (which certificate must be delivered to the Administrative Agent within
thirty days following such default, prepayment or conversion) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section
shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

    SECTION 2.19 TAXES.

            (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note
    will be, except as provided in Section 2.19(b), made free and clear of, and
    without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies,
    imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now
    or hereafter imposed by any Governmental Authority or by any political
    subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such
    payments (but excluding any tax imposed on or measured by the net income or
    profits of a Lender) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with
    respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
    assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as "TAXES"). If
    any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full
    amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so
    that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any
    Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will
    not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. The
    Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable
    after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law
    certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and required by law) of
    tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to
    indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its
    written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and

                                       53
<Page>

    paid by such Lender but excluding any interest or penalties caused by
    such Lender's failure to pay any such taxes when due.

            (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is
    defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the
    Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in
    the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under
    this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.6(d) (unless the respective Lender was
    already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or
    transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) if
    the Lender is a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
    Code, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
    Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or successor forms) certifying such Lender's
    entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with
    respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or
    (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section
    881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
    W-8ECI as set forth in clause (i) above, or (x) a certificate substantially
    in the form of SCHEDULE 2.19 (any such certificate, a "2.19 CERTIFICATE")
    and (y) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
    Service Form W-8 (or successor form) certifying such Lender's entitlement to
    an exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments of
    interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Note. In addition,
    each Lender agrees that it will deliver upon the Borrower's request updated
    versions of the foregoing, as applicable, whenever the previous
    certification has become obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect,
    together with such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or
    establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or
    reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under
    this Agreement and any Note. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
    contained in Section 2.19(a), but subject to the immediately succeeding
    sentence, (x) each Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required
    to do so by law, to deduct or withhold Taxes imposed by the United States
    (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from
    interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any
    Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in
    Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the
    extent that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower U.S. Internal
    Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such
    deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated
    pursuant to Section 2.19(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a
    Lender in respect of Taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender
    has not provided to the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required
    to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.19(b) or (II) in
    the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in clause
    (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do not establish a complete
    exemption from withholding of such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section
    2.19, the Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each
    Lender in the manner set forth in Section 2.19(a) (without regard to the
    identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in
    respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the
    immediately preceding sentence as a result of any changes after the Closing
    Date in any

                                       54
<Page>

    applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline
    or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or
    withholding of Taxes.

            (c) Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including
    reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office or LIBOR Lending
    Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which might
    otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
    efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional
    costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole
    discretion to be material.

            (d) If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant to this
    Section 2.19 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use reasonable
    efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax liabilities on
    account of such payment; PROVIDED that such Lender shall have no obligation
    to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is in an excess foreign tax
    credit position or (ii) it believes in good faith, in its sole discretion,
    that claiming a refund or credit would cause adverse tax consequences to it.
    In the event that such Lender receives such a refund or credit, such Lender
    shall pay to the Borrower an amount that such Lender reasonably determines
    is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by such Lender as a result of such
    payment by the Borrower. In the event that no refund or credit is obtained
    with respect to the Borrower's payments to such Lender pursuant to this
    Section 2.19(d), then such Lender shall upon request provide a certification
    that such Lender has not received a refund or credit for such payments.
    Nothing contained in this Section 2.19(d) shall require a Lender to disclose
    or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of any tax benefit or
    any other amount or the basis of its determination referred to in the
    proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.19(d) to the Borrower or any
    other party.

            (e) The agreements in this Section 2.19 shall survive the
    termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other
    amounts payable hereunder.

    SECTION 2.20 INDEMNIFICATION; NATURE OF ISSUING LENDER'S DUTIES.

            (a) In addition to its other obligations under Section 2.3, the
    Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save the Issuing
    Lender harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
    damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
    attorneys' fees) that the Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a
    consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit
    or (ii) the failure of the Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter
    of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful,
    of any present or future de jure or de facto government or governmental
    authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called "GOVERNMENT ACTS").

            (b) As between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender, the Borrower
    shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of
    Credit by the beneficiary thereof. The Issuing Lender shall not be
    responsible: (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness
    or legal effect of any document submitted by

                                       55
<Page>

    any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any
    Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
    respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for
    the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
    purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or
    benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove
    to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the
    beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required
    in order to draw upon a Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions,
    interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by
    mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in
    cipher; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) for any
    loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
    order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof;
    and (vii) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the
    Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of
    the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing
    Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

            (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
    specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by
    the Issuing Lender, under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the
    related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such
    Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower. It is the
    intention of the parties that this Agreement shall be construed and applied
    to protect and indemnify the Issuing Lender against any and all risks
    involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are
    hereby assumed by the Borrower, including, without limitation, any and all
    risks of the acts or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
    Governmental Authority. The Issuing Lender shall not, in any way, be liable
    for any failure by the Issuing Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing
    under any Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other
    cause beyond the control of the Issuing Lender.

            (d) Nothing in this Section 2.20 is intended to limit the
    reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained in Section 2.3(d) hereof.
    The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.20 shall survive the
    termination of this Agreement. No act or omissions of any current or prior
    beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way affect or impair the
    rights of the Issuing Lender to enforce any right, power or benefit under
    this Agreement.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
    Section 2.20, the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify any Issuing
    Lender in respect of any liability incurred by such Issuing Lender arising
    out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender
    (including action not taken by an Issuing Lender), as determined by a court
    of competent jurisdiction.

    SECTION 2.21 DEFAULTING LENDERS; LIMITATION ON CLAIMS.

            (a) GENERALLY. In addition to the rights and remedies that may be
    available to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower under this Agreement
    or applicable law, if at

                                       56
<Page>

    any time a Lender is a Defaulting Lender such Defaulting Lender's right
    to participate in the administration of the Loans, this Agreement and the
    other Credit Documents (excluding for purposes hereof, those matters
    requiring the unanimous consent or approval of the Lenders, or requiring the
    approval of each Lender directly affected thereby, pursuant to Section
    9.1(i) through 9.1(vii) hereof or Section 9.6(a)), including without
    limitation, any right to vote in respect of, to consent to or to direct any
    action or inaction of the Administrative Agent or to be taken into account
    in the calculation of the Required Lenders, shall be suspended during the
    pendency of such failure or refusal. If a Lender is a Defaulting Lender
    because it has failed to make timely payment to the Administrative Agent of
    any amount required to be paid to the Administrative Agent hereunder
    (without giving effect to any notice or cure periods), in addition to other
    rights and remedies which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have
    under the immediately preceding provisions or otherwise, the Administrative
    Agent shall be entitled (i) to collect interest from such Defaulting Lender
    on such delinquent payment for the period from the date on which the payment
    was due until the date on which the payment is made at the Federal Funds
    Effective Rate, (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in satisfaction of
    the defaulted payment and any related interest, any amounts otherwise
    payable to such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement or any other Credit
    Document until such defaulted payment and related interest has been paid in
    full and such default no longer exists and (iii) to bring an action or suit
    against such Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to
    recover the defaulted amount and any related interest. Any amounts received
    by the Administrative Agent in respect of a Defaulting Lender's Loans shall
    not be paid to such Defaulting Lender and shall be held uninvested by the
    Administrative Agent and either applied against the purchase price of such
    Loans under the following subsection (b) or paid to such Defaulting Lender
    upon the default of such Defaulting Lender being cured.

            (b) PURCHASE OF DEFAULTING LENDER'S COMMITMENT. Any Lender who is
    not a Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its
    sole discretion, to acquire all of a Defaulting Lender's Commitment. If more
    than one Lender exercises such right, each such Lender shall have the right
    to acquire such proportion of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment on a PRO
    RATA basis. Upon any such purchase, the Defaulting Lender's interest in the
    Loans and its rights hereunder (but not its liability in respect thereof or
    under the Credit Documents or this Agreement to the extent the same relate
    to the period prior to the effective date of the purchase) shall terminate
    on the date of purchase, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute
    all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest
    to the purchaser thereof subject to and in accordance with the requirements
    set forth in Section 9.6, including an appropriate Commitment Transfer
    Supplement. The purchase price for the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender
    shall be equal to the sum of the amount of the principal balance of the
    Loans outstanding and owed by the Borrower to the Defaulting Lender, plus
    any accrued interest with respect thereto, plus any fees or other amounts
    owed by the Borrower to the Defaulting Lender. Prior to payment of such
    purchase price to a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent shall apply
    against such purchase price any amounts retained by the Administrative Agent
    pursuant to the last sentence of the immediately preceding subsection (a).
    The Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive amounts owed to it by

                                       57
<Page>

    the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Loans and
    the Notes, and fees and other amounts due under the Credit Documents which
    accrued prior to the date of the default by the Defaulting Lender, to the
    extent the same are received by the Administrative Agent from or on behalf
    of the Borrower. There shall be no recourse against any Lender or the
    Administrative Agent for the payment of such sums by the Borrower except to
    the extent of the receipt of payments from any other party or in respect of
    the Loans.

    SECTION 2.22   REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

    If any Lender shall become affected by any of the changes or events
described in Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 2.19 (any such Lender being
hereinafter referred to as a "REPLACED LENDER") and shall petition the Borrower
for any increased cost or amounts thereunder, then in such case, the Borrower
may, upon at least five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent
and such Replaced Lender, designate a replacement lender (a "REPLACEMENT
LENDER") acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion, to
which such Replaced Lender shall, subject to its receipt (unless a later date
for the remittance thereof shall be agreed upon by the Borrower and the Replaced
Lender) of all amounts owed to such Replaced Lender under Sections 2.15, 2.16,
2.17 or 2.19 assign all (but not less than all) of its rights, obligations,
Loans and Commitments hereunder; PROVIDED, that all amounts owed to such
Replaced Lender by the Borrower (except liabilities which by the terms hereof
survive the payment in full of the Loans and termination of this Agreement)
shall be paid in full as of the date of such assignment. Upon any assignment by
any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.22 becoming effective, the Replacement
Lender shall thereupon be deemed to be a "Lender" for all purposes of this
Agreement and such Replaced Lender shall thereupon cease to be a "Lender" for
all purposes of this Agreement and shall have no further rights or obligations
hereunder (other than pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 2.19 and 9.5
while such Replaced Lender was a Lender).

Notwithstanding any Replaced Lender's failure or refusal to assign its rights,
obligations, Loans and Commitments under this Section 2.22, the Replaced Lender
shall cease to be a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Replacement Lender substituted therefor upon payment to the Replaced Lender by
the Replacement Lender of all amounts set forth in this Section 2.22 without any
further action of the Replaced Lender.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the
Extensions of Credit herein provided for, the Credit Parties hereby represent
and warrant to the Administrative Agent and to each Lender that as of the
Funding Date and thereafter for so long as this Agreement is in effect and until
the Commitments have terminated, no Note remains outstanding and unpaid and the
Credit Party Obligations, together with interest, Commitment Fees and all other
amounts owing to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder are paid in
full:

                                       58
<Page>

    SECTION 3.1   FINANCIAL CONDITION.

    The consolidated balance sheets and the related statements of income,
retained earnings and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding
the Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries) for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2000 and for the most recently ended fiscal quarter ending more than sixty
(60) days prior to the Funding Date, and for the Acquired Company and its
Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending May 25, 2001 and for the most recently
ended fiscal quarter ending more than sixty (60) days prior to the Funding Date,
are complete and correct and present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial condition of, and the results of operations for, such Persons as of
such dates. All such financial statements, including the related schedules and
notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently
throughout the periods involved (except as disclosed therein). The Borrower and
its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, have on the date hereof no
material contingent liabilities, liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or
long-term commitments or unrealized or anticipated losses from any unfavorable
commitments, except as referred to or reflected or provided for in the annual
financial information provided as of the immediately preceding fiscal year end
referred to above and as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1 or as set forth on SCHEDULE
6.1(b).

    SECTION 3.2   NO CHANGE.

         Since December 31, 2000 (and after delivery of annual audited financial
statements in accordance with Section 5.1(a), from the date of the most recently
delivered annual audited financial statements) there has been no development or
event which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

    SECTION 3.3   CORPORATE EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

    Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, (b) has the requisite power and authority and the legal right to
own and operate all its material property, to lease the material property it
operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged,
(c) is duly qualified to conduct business and in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification except to the extent that

            standard of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA,
            including, without limitation, the failure to make on or before its
            due date a required installment under Section 412(m) of the Code or
            Section 302(e) of ERISA, shall be a reportable event regardless of

<Page>

                (iv) the complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer
            Plan by any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
            Affiliate that results in liability under Section 4201 or 4204 of
            ERISA (including the obligation to satisfy secondary liability as a
            result of a purchaser default) or the receipt by any Credit Party or
            any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of notice from a
            Multiemployer Plan that it is in reorganization or insolvency
            pursuant to Section 4241 or 4245 of ERISA or that it intends to

            which proceeding is not dismissed within 30 days; and

                (vi) the adoption of an amendment to any Plan that, pursuant to
            Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of ERISA, would result
            in the loss of tax-exempt status of the trust of which such Plan is
            a part if any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
            Affiliate fails to timely provide security to the Plan in accordance
            with the provisions of said Sections;

            (e) any assertion of any Environmental Claim by any Person against,
    or with respect to the activities of, the Borrower or any of its
    Subsidiaries and notice of any alleged violation of or non-compliance with
    any Environmental Laws or any permits, licenses or authorizations, other
    than any Environmental Claim or alleged violation that, if adversely
    determined, would not (either individually or in the aggregate) have a

    Authorities related thereto, including, without limitation, reasonable
    attorney's and consultant's fees, investigation and laboratory fees,
    response costs, court costs and litigation expenses, except to the extent
    that any of the foregoing arise out of the gross negligence or willful
    misconduct of the party seeking indemnification therefor. The agreements in
    this paragraph shall survive repayment of the Notes and all other amounts
    payable hereunder.

    SECTION 5.9   FINANCIAL COVENANTS.

    SECTION 5.10 OBLIGATIONS REGARDING SUBSIDIARIES; ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARY
GUARANTORS.


            (a) Except as permitted by Section 6.4, the Borrower will, and will

    after acquired or otherwise existing, to promptly become a Guarantor
    hereunder by way of execution of a Joinder Agreement and take such other
    action as may be required pursuant to the terms of Section 5.13. The
    guaranty obligations of each Additional Credit Party shall be secured by all
    real and personal property assets of such Additional Credit Party pursuant
    to the requirements of Section 5.13; provided, that obligations of the
    Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be secured by any real

    that own any real property.

    agreed by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) all of such Credit Party's real
    and personal property Collateral to be subject at all times to a first
    priority, perfected Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to
    the terms and conditions of the Security Documents or such other security
    documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request subject only
    to Permitted Liens; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
    no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be required to pledge the Capital Stock of
    its Subsidiaries and the Borrower shall not be required to pledge the
    Capital Stock of Suiza Capital Trust II, and the Acquired Company and its
    Subsidiaries shall not be required to grant Liens in any real property nor

reasonable detail describing all of the assets of such Person and shall (a) if
such Person is a wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiary of a Credit Party, cause such

Company), (b) cause 100% (if such Person is a Domestic Subsidiary of a Credit

Stock of such Person owned by a Credit Party to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent (together with undated stock powers signed in blank
(unless, with respect to a First Tier Foreign Subsidiary, such stock powers are
deemed unnecessary by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion
under the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Person)) and pledged
to the Administrative Agent pursuant to an appropriate pledge agreement(s) in
substantially the form of the Pledge Agreement or joinder to the Pledge
Agreement and otherwise in form acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (c) if

effectiveness thereof (and the Administrative Agent will promptly furnish a copy
thereof to each Lender).

    SECTION 5.15   FURTHER ASSURANCES.

    Upon the request of the Administrative Agent promptly perform or cause to be
performed any and all acts and execute or cause to be executed any and all
documents (including, without limitation, financing statements and continuation
statements) for filing under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or
any other Requirement of Law which are necessary or advisable to maintain in
favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, Liens on the
Collateral that are duly perfected in accordance with all applicable
Requirements of Law.

    SECTION 5.16   GOOD STANDING; POST-CLOSING QUALIFICATION.

    Within 30 days after the Funding Date, the Credit Parties will cause each of
their Subsidiaries that are restructured or reorganized on or about the Funding
Date to be duly qualified to conduct business and in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification except to the extent
that the failure to so qualify or be in good standing could not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

    condition, together with all other such events or conditions, if any, could
    have a Material Adverse Effect; or

            (h) A reasonable basis shall exist for the assertion against the
    Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any predecessor in interest of the
    Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, of (or there shall have been asserted
    against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) an Environmental Claim
    that, in the judgment of the Required Lenders, is reasonably likely to be
    determined adversely to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and the
    amount thereof (either individually or in the aggregate) is reasonably
    likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (insofar as such amount is payable
    by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries but after deducting any portion
    thereof that is reasonably expected to be paid by other creditworthy Persons
    jointly and severally liable therefor); or

            (i) A Change of Control shall occur; or

            (j) The Guaranty or any provision thereof shall cease to be in full
    force and effect or any Guarantor or any Person acting by or on behalf of
    any Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm any Guarantor's obligations under the
    Guaranty; or

            (k) Any other Credit Document shall fail to be in full force and
    effect or to give the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders the security
    interests, liens, rights, powers and privileges purported to be created
    thereby (except as such documents may be terminated or no longer in force
    and effect in accordance with the terms thereof, other than those
    indemnities and provisions which by their terms shall survive).

    SECTION 7.2   ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, then, and in any such
event, (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(e)
above, automatically the Commitments shall immediately terminate and the Loans
(with accrued interest thereon), and all other amounts under the Credit
Documents (including without limitation the maximum amount of all contingent
liabilities under Letters of Credit) shall immediately become due and payable,
the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enforce any and all other
rights and interests created and existing under the Credit Documents, including,
without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Security
Documents, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of
set-off, and the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enforce any and
all other rights and remedies of a creditor under applicable law, and (b) if
such event is any other Event of Default, with the written consent of the
Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or upon the written request of
the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower
(a copy of which shall be sent to the Lenders), take any or all of the following
actions: (i) declare the Commitments to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the
Commitments shall immediately terminate; (ii) declare the Loans (with accrued
interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the Notes
to be due and payable forthwith and direct the Borrower to

                                       95
<Page>

pay to the Administrative Agent cash collateral as security for the LOC
Obligations for subsequent drawings under then outstanding Letters of Credit in
an amount equal to the maximum amount of which may be drawn under Letters of
Credit then outstanding, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and
payable; (iii) enforce any and all other rights and interests created and
existing under the Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all rights
and remedies existing under the Security Documents, all rights and remedies
against a Guarantor and all rights of set-off; and (iv) enforce any and all
rights and remedies of a creditor under applicable law. Except as expressly
provided above in this Section 7.2, presentment, demand, protest and all other
notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    THE AGENT

    SECTION 8.1   APPOINTMENT.

    Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints First Union
National Bank as the Administrative Agent of such Lender under this Agreement,
and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes First Union National Bank, as the
Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of
this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

    SECTION 8.2   DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

    The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may appoint one of its
Affiliates as its agent to perform the functions of the Administrative Agent
hereunder relating to the advancing of funds to the Borrower and distribution of
funds to the Lenders and to perform such other related functions of the
Administrative Agent hereunder as are reasonably incidental to such functions.

    SECTION 8.3  EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

    Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of

                                       96
<Page>

the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any Credit Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of any of the Credit Documents or for any failure of any Credit
Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance by the Credit Parties of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Credit Parties.

    SECTION 8.4   RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

    The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes unless (a) a written notice of assignment, negotiation
or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent and (b)
the Administrative Agent shall have received the written agreement of such
assignee to be bound hereby as fully and to the same extent as if such assignee
were an original Lender party hereto, in each case in form satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
any of the Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders
or all of the Lenders, as may be required under this Agreement, and such request
and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon
all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

    SECTION 8.5   NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

    The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders except to the extent that
this Credit Agreement

                                       97
<Page>

expressly requires that such action be taken, or not taken, only with the
consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders, or all of the
Lenders, as the case may be.

    SECTION 8.6   NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.

    Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its own decision to make
its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may come
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

    SECTION 8.7   INDEMNIFICATION.

    The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity
hereunder (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective
Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
under this Section, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without
limitation, at any time following the payment of the Notes) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of any Credit Document or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
agreements in this Section 8.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

                                       98
<Page>

    SECTION 8.8   ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

    The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as
though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity.

    SECTION 8.9   SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

    The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent
shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Notes, then
the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for
the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower, so long as
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Notes. If no successor Administrative Agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent within sixty (60) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless become effective and the Lenders shall
perform all duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if
any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 8.9 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

    SECTION 8.10   RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER AGENTS.

    The Syndication Agent, the co-documentation agents and any other agents
designated as such on the signature pages hereto (other than the Administrative
Agent) shall have no responsibilities under this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents other than as a Lender.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

    SECTION 9.1   AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.

    Neither this Agreement, nor any of the Notes, nor any of the other
Credit Documents, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented,
waived or modified except in

                                       99
<Page>

accordance with the provisions of this Section nor may be released except as
specifically provided herein or in the Security Documents or in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 9.1. The Required Lenders may, or, with the
written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, from time
to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written amendments, supplements or
modifications hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the purpose of adding
any provisions to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or changing in
any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder
or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders may specify
in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other
Credit Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences or (c)
release Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof or of any Security
Document or on such other terms and conditions as the Required Lenders may
agree; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such waiver and no such amendment, waiver,
supplement, modification or release shall:

                (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity
            of any Loan or Note or any installment thereon, or the reimbursement
            obligations with respect to any Letters of Credit, or extend the
            expiry of any Letter of Credit beyond the Maturity Date, or reduce
            the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (other than
            interest at the increased post-default rate) or extend the scheduled
            date of any payment thereof or increase the amount or extend the
            expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in each case without the
            written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (it being
            understood and agreed that changes to the financial definitions and
            financial covenants herein shall only require the consent of the
            Required Lenders and waivers of mandatory prepayments of the Loans
            required pursuant to Section 2.8(b) hereof shall not constitute
            increases in the Commitment of any Lender or extensions of the
            scheduled date of any payments to any Lender); or

                (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.13 or
            this Section 9.1, or reduce the percentage specified in the
            definition of Required Lenders, without the written consent of all
            the Lenders; or

                (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article VIII
            without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent; or

                (iv) release all or any substantial portion of the Guarantors
            from their obligations under the Guaranty without the written
            consent of all of the Lenders; or

                (v) release all or any substantial portion of the Collateral
            without the written consent of all of the Lenders, or

                (vi) amend, modify or waive the allocation of any payments or
            the realization of proceeds of Collateral among the Revolving Loans,
            the Tranche A Term Loans and/or the Tranche B Term Loans (or between
            any two of such Loans), or the order of application of payments
            specified in Section 2.8 without the consent

                                      100
<Page>

            of, if affected thereby, (i) Lenders holding greater than 50% of
            the Revolving Committed Amount, (ii) Lenders holding greater than
            50% of the outstanding Tranche A Term Loans and (iii) Lenders
            holding greater than 50% of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loans.

                (vii) amend, modify or waive the requirement that any issue be
            resolved or determined with the consent, approval or upon the
            request of the Required Lenders without the written consent of the
            Required Lenders, or with the consent, approval or upon the request
            of all Lenders, without the written consent of all of the Lenders to
            the change of such voting requirement and, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
            no amendment, waiver or consent affecting the rights or duties of
            the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender under any Credit
            Document shall in any event be effective, unless in writing and
            signed by the Administrative Agent and/or the Issuing Lender, as
            applicable, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take
            such action.

    Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and any
such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the
Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event
of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or
impair any right consequent thereon.

    Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent of
the Credit Parties shall not be required for any amendment, modification or
waiver of the provisions of Article VIII (other than the provisions of Section
8.9); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrative Agent will provide written
notice to the Borrower of any such amendment, modification or waiver. In
addition, the Borrower and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent
to modify this Credit Agreement by unilaterally amending or supplementing
SCHEDULE 2.1(a) from time to time in the manner requested by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in order to reflect any assignments or
transfers of the Loans as provided for hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of any such modification to
the Borrower and each Lender.

    Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a
Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the
execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of the Credit
Documents and any such other documents and the use, or proposed use, of proceeds
of the Loans (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED
LIABILITIES"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower shall not have any
obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to
indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Administrative Agent or any such Lender, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction. The agreements in this Section 9.5 shall survive
repayment or assignment of the Loans, Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

    SECTION 9.6   SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS; PURCHASING LENDERS.

            (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
    the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of
    the Notes and their respective successors and assigns, except that the
    Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under
    this Agreement or the other Credit Documents without the prior written
    consent of each Lender.

            (b) Any Lender may, without notice to or consent of the Borrower and
    the Administrative Agent, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
    business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or
    more banks or other entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in any
    Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of
    such Lender, or any other interest of such Lender hereunder; (provided,
    however, that no settlement date relating to any such sale shall occur prior
    to the date which is one Business Day after the Funding Date). In the event
    of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant,
    such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this
    Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely
    responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder
    of any such Note for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Borrower and
    the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
    such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under
    this Agreement. No Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under
    which the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or
    waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent
    such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of any Loan
    or Note, or extend the expiry date of any Letter of Credit in which such
    Participant is participating beyond the Maturity Date, or any installment
    thereon in which such Participant is participating, or reduce the stated
    rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon (except in
    connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default rate) or
    reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the
    Participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
    understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not
    constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase
    in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without consent of any
    Participant if the Participant's participation is not increased as a result
    thereof), (ii) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their
    obligations under the Guaranty, (iii) release all or substantially all of
    the Collateral, or (iv) consent to the assignment or transfer by the
    Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement other
    than in accordance with this Agreement. In the case of any such
    participation, the Participant shall not have any rights under this
    Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the Participant's rights
    against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth
    in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant
    relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be
    determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; PROVIDED that
    each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16,
    2.17, 2.18, 2.19 and 9.5 with respect to its participation in the
    Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time, but no Participant
    shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections
    than

                                      104
<Page>

    the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of
    the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to
    such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

            (c) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
    accordance with applicable law, at any time after the Funding Date, sell or
    assign to any Lender, any Affiliate of a Lender or in the case of the
    Tranche A Term Loan or the Tranche B Term Loan, any special purpose entity
    created thereby (including, without limitation, any entity which is engaged
    in investing in bank loans and is administered by a Lender or an Affiliate
    of a Lender) or an Approved Fund and with the consent of the Administrative
    Agent (provided, however, that no settlement date relating to such sale or
    assignment shall occur prior to the date which is one Business Day after the
    Funding Date) and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
    continuing, the Borrower (in each case, which consent shall not be
    unreasonably withheld or delayed), to one or more additional banks, funds or
    other financial institutions ("PURCHASING LENDERS"), all or any part of its
    rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes in minimum amounts
    of (x) $5,000,000 with respect to its Revolving Commitment and its Revolving
    Loans or (y) $1,000,000 with respect to its Tranche A Term Loan or Tranche B
    Term Loan (or, if less, the entire amount of such Lender's obligations or
    such lesser amount agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent),
    pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing
    Lender and such transferor Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing Lender
    that is not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, the Administrative Agent
    and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
    Borrower), and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and
    recording in the Register; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any sale or assignment to
    an existing Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or in the case of the Tranche A
    Term Loan or the Tranche B Term Loan, a special purpose entity created
    thereby or an Approved Fund shall not require the consent of the
    Administrative Agent or the Borrower nor shall any such sale or assignment
    be subject to the minimum assignment amounts specified herein. Upon such
    execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the Transfer
    Effective Date specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the
    Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
    provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and
    obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein,
    and (y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in
    such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under
    this Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment Transfer Supplement
    covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights and
    obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Lender shall cease to be a
    party hereto). Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend
    this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect
    the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of
    Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender
    of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender
    under this Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the Transfer Effective
    Date specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the Borrower, at its
    own expense, and to the extent requested by the Purchasing Lender shall
    execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the Notes
    delivered to the

                                      105
<Page>

    Administrative Agent pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement
    new Notes to the order of such Purchasing Lender in an amount equal to the
    Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement
    and, unless the transferor Lender has not retained a Commitment hereunder,
    new Notes to the order of the transferor Lender in an amount equal to the
    Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be dated the
    Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes replaced
    thereby. The Notes surrendered by the transferor Lender shall be returned by
    the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled".

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
    to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to
    it and a register (the "REGISTER") for the recordation of the names and
    addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
    Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register
    shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
    Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
    recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
    purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
    by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time
    upon reasonable prior notice.

            (e) Upon its receipt of a duly executed Commitment Transfer
    Supplement, together with payment to the Administrative Agent by the
    transferor Lender or the Purchasing Lender, as agreed between them, of a
    registration and processing fee of $3,500 for each Purchasing Lender listed
    in such Commitment Transfer Supplement and the Notes subject to such
    Commitment Transfer Supplement, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept
    such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (ii) record the information contained
    therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice of such acceptance and
    recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

            (f) The Credit Parties authorize each Lender to disclose to any
    Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and any prospective
    Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession
    concerning the Credit Parties, their Subsidiaries and their Affiliates which
    has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Credit Parties
    pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or
    on behalf of the Credit Parties in connection with such Lender's credit
    evaluation of the Credit Parties and their Affiliates prior to becoming a
    party to this Agreement, in each case subject to Section 9.15.

            (g) At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 9.6 to a
    Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United
    States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
    for Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall
    provide to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent the appropriate
    Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable, a 2.19 Certificate)
    described in Section 2.19.

                                      106
<Page>

            (h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
    assigning any of its rights under this Agreement (including, without
    limitation, any right to payment of principal and interest under any Note)
    to any creditor or representative of creditors including any assignment to
    any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable laws. In the case of
    any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, such Lender may,
    without the consent of the Borrower or Administrative Agent, assign or
    pledge all or any portion of its Tranche A Term Note or its Tranche B Term
    Note or any other instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under the
    Tranche A Term Loan or Tranche B Term Loan under this Agreement to any
    trustee for, or any other representative of, holders of obligations owed or
    securities issued, by such fund, as security for such obligations or
    securities; PROVIDED that any foreclosure or similar action by such trustee
    or representative shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.6
    concerning assignments.

    SECTION 9.7   ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.

            (a) Each Lender agrees that if any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER")
    shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or
    interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether
    voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings
    of the nature referred to in Section 7.1(e), or otherwise) in a greater
    proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other
    Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans, or interest
    thereon, such benefited Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative
    Agent thereof, and purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
    interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Loans, or shall provide
    such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds
    thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the
    excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each
    of the Lenders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess
    payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such
    purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
    to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees
    that each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may
    exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of
    set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the
    direct holder of such portion.

            (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
    by law (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off), each Lender
    shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice
    being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable
    law, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, to setoff and appropriate
    and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
    provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness
    or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect,
    absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by
    such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the
    account of the Borrower, or any part thereof in such amounts as such Lender
    may elect, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of the
    Borrower to such Lender hereunder and claims of every nature and description
    of such Lender against the Borrower, in any currency, whether arising

                                      107
<Page>

    hereunder, under the Notes or under any documents contemplated by or
    referred to herein or therein, as such Lender may elect, whether or not such
    Lender has made any demand for payment and although such obligations,
    liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. The aforesaid right
    of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower or against
    any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
    creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the
    Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or
    any such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
    benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment
    creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have
    been exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of any Event of
    Default. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
    Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
    Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such notice shall not
    affect the validity of such set-off and application.

    SECTION 9.8   TABLE OF CONTENTS AND SECTION HEADINGS.

    The table of contents and the Section and subsection headings herein

SECTION 9.2 or, in the case of the Lenders, shall have given to the
Administrative Agent written, telecopied or telex notice (actually received) at
such office that the same has been signed and mailed to it.

    SECTION 9.11   SEVERABILITY.

    Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining

jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

Agreement, each of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties accepts, for itself
and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably agrees to be
bound by any final judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement
from which no appeal has been taken or is available. Each of the Borrower and
the other Credit Parties irrevocably agrees that all service of process in any

address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
thereto, such service being hereby acknowledged by each of the Borrower and the
other Credit Parties to be effective and binding service in every respect. To
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, each of the Borrower,
the other Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders irrevocably
waives any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to the laying
of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens which it may now or
hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in any such

other jurisdiction.

pursuant to this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein and which is designated by the
Borrower to the Lenders in writing as confidential or as to which it is
otherwise reasonably clear

            (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
    delivery of each Credit Document;

            (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any
    fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower or any other Credit
    Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and the
    relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the
    Borrower and the other Credit Parties, on the other hand, in connection
    herewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

            (c) no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the Borrower

    SECTION 9.17   WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL.

    THE BORROWER, THE OTHER CREDIT PARTIES, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE
LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. The

                                    ARTICLE X

                                    GUARANTY

    Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees as follows:

    SECTION 10.1   THE GUARANTY.

    In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend
credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by the
Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder, each of the Guarantors
hereby agrees with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as follows: each
Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and severally
guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt
payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of any
and all indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders. If any or all of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders becomes due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, on order, on demand, together with any and all reasonable
expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in
collecting any of the indebtedness. The word "indebtedness" is used in this
Article X in its most comprehensive sense and includes any and all advances,
debts, obligations and liabilities of the Borrower arising in connection with
this Agreement, including, without limitation, Hedging Agreements with any
Lender permitted hereunder, in each case, heretofore, now, or hereafter made,
incurred or created, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or
not such indebtedness is from time to time reduced, or extinguished and
thereafter increased or incurred, whether the Borrower may be liable
individually or jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such
indebtedness may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations,
and whether or not such indebtedness may be or hereafter become otherwise
unenforceable.

    Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any
other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including,
without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the
Bankruptcy Code).

    SECTION 10.2   BANKRUPTCY.

    Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all indebtedness of the
Borrower to the Lenders whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the
occurrence of any of the events specified in

                                      111
<Page>

Section 7.1(e), and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, or order, on demand, in
lawful money of the United States. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to
the extent that the Borrower or a Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer
of an interest in any property to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which
payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to
be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be
repaid to the Borrower or a Guarantor, the estate of the Borrower or a
Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law,
state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had
not been made.

    SECTION 10.3   NATURE OF LIABILITY.

    The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of
any security for or other guaranty of the indebtedness of the Borrower whether
executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and
no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or impaired by (a) any
direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by any other party, or
(b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of
a guarantor or of any other party as to the indebtedness of the Borrower, or (c)
any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (d)
any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the
Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on
the indebtedness which the Administrative Agent or such Lenders repay the
Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each of the Guarantors waives
any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason
of any such proceeding. The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are absolute
and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity
or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement entered
into in connection with this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to therein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or a guarantor.

    SECTION 10.4   INDEPENDENT OBLIGATION.

    The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of any other Guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not
action is brought against any other Guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not
any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.

    SECTION 10.5   AUTHORIZATION.

    Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent and each Lender
without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and
cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder,
from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase, accelerate or
otherwise change the time for payment of, or

                                      112
<Page>

otherwise change the terms of the indebtedness or any part thereof in accordance
with this Agreement, including any increase or decrease of the rate of interest
thereon, (b) take and hold security from any Guarantor or any other party for
the payment of this Guaranty or the indebtedness and exchange, enforce, waive
and release any such security, (c) apply such security and direct the order or
manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their
discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute any one or more
endorsers, guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors.

    SECTION 10.6   RELIANCE.

    It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to inquire
into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners
or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any indebtedness made
or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be
guaranteed hereunder.

    SECTION 10.7   WAIVER.

            (a) Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be
    required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the
    Administrative Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any
    other Guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any
    security held from the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other party, or
    (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's
    power whatsoever. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or
    arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other
    party other than payment in full of the indebtedness, including without
    limitation any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the
    Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of
    the indebtedness or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from
    any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the
    indebtedness. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this
    Article X, each of the Guarantors hereby specifically waives the benefits of
    N.C. Gen. Stat. ss. 26-7 through 26-9, inclusive. The Administrative Agent
    or any of the Lenders may, at their election, foreclose on any security held
    by the Administrative Agent or a Lender by one or more judicial or
    nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is
    commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable
    law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent and any
    Lender may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any security,
    without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor
    hereunder except to the extent the indebtedness has been paid. Each of the
    Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election by the
    Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, even though such election
    operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation
    or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against the Borrower or any other
    party or any security.

            (b) Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for
    performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of
    nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of
    acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or
    incurring of new or additional

                                      113
<Page>

    indebtedness. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and
    keeping itself informed of each of the Borrower's financial condition and
    assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment
    of the indebtedness and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such
    Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the
    Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such
    Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.

            (c) Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise any
    rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of
    this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders against the Borrower or any
    other guarantor of the indebtedness of the Borrower owing to the Lenders
    (collectively, the "OTHER PARTIES") and all contractual, statutory or common
    law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other Party
    which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until
    such time as the Loans hereunder shall have been paid and the Commitments
    have been terminated. Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees not to
    exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the Administrative
    Agent and the Lenders now have or may hereafter have against any Other
    Party, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the
    indebtedness of the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to
    participate in, any security or collateral given to or for the benefit of
    the Lenders to secure payment of the indebtedness of the Borrower until such
    time as the Loans hereunder shall have been paid and the Commitments have
    been terminated.

    SECTION 10.8  LIMITATION ON ENFORCEMENT.

    The Lenders agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action
of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders
and that no Lender shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to
enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders upon the terms of this Agreement. The Lenders further agree that this
Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Guarantors.

    SECTION 10.9   CONFIRMATION OF PAYMENT.

    The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after
payment of the indebtedness and obligations which are the subject of this
Guaranty and termination of the commitments relating thereto, confirm to the
Borrower, the Guarantors or any other Person that such indebtedness and
obligations have been paid and the commitments relating thereto terminated,
subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.
