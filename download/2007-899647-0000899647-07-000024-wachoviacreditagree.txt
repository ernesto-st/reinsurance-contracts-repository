         WHEREAS, the Credit Parties (as hereinafter defined) have requested

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto, such parties
hereby agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

         Section 1.1       Defined Terms.

         "Account Designation Notice" shall mean the Account Designation Notice
dated as of the Closing Date from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1(a).

         "Additional Credit Party" shall mean each Person that becomes a

         "Additional Term Loan" shall have the meaning set forth in Section

the first paragraph of this Agreement and shall include any successors in such
capacity.
<PAGE>

         "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean an Administrative
Questionnaire in a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.

         "Affiliate" shall mean, with respect to a specified Person, another

         "Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum equal

Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For purposes hereof:
"Prime Rate" shall mean, at any time, the rate of interest per annum publicly
announced or otherwise identified from time to time by Wachovia at its principal
office in Charlotte, North Carolina as its prime rate. Each change in the Prime
Rate shall be effective as of the opening of business on the day such change in

or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the opening of
business on the date of such change.

         "Alternate Base Rate Loans" shall mean Loans that bear interest at an
interest rate based on the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Applicable Percentage" shall mean, (a) for any day with respect to

(b) for any day with respect to the Term Loan, the following rate per annum, (i)
so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 4.75 to
1.0 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, that portion
of the Term Loan comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be 1.00% at all
times, (ii) so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 4.75 to 1.0
as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, that portion of
the Term Loan comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be 0.75% at all
times, (iii) so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal

all times and (iv) so long as the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 4.75
to 1.0 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter, that
portion of the Term Loan comprised of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be 1.75%.

         The Applicable Percentage shall, in each case, be determined and
adjusted quarterly on the date five (5) Business Days after the date on which
the Administrative Agent has received from the Borrower the quarterly financial
information (in the case of the first three fiscal quarters of the Borrower's
fiscal year), the annual financial information (in the case of the fourth fiscal
quarter of the Borrower's fiscal year) and the certifications required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(b) and 5.2(b) (each an "Interest
Determination Date"). Such Applicable Percentage shall be effective from such
Interest Determination Date until the next such Interest Determination Date.
After the Closing Date, if the Credit Parties shall fail to provide the
financial information or certifications in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(b) and 5.2(b), the Applicable Percentage shall, on the date
five (5) Business Days after the date by which the Credit Parties were so
required to provide such financial information or certifications to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be based on (a) with respect to Revolving

<PAGE>

Loans, Level I and (b) with respect to the Term Loans, clauses (i) and (iii) set
forth above, in each case until such time as such information or certifications
or corrected information or corrected certificates are provided, whereupon the
level shall be determined by the then current Consolidated Leverage Ratio.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial Applicable Percentages for the
Revolving Loans and the Commitment Fee shall be set at Level I until the
financial information and certificates required to be delivered pursuant to
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 for the first full fiscal quarter to occur after the
Closing Date have been delivered to the Administrative Agent. In the event that
any financial statement or certification delivered pursuant to Section 5.1 is
shown to be inaccurate (regardless of whether this Agreement or the Commitments
are in effect when such inaccuracy is discovered), and such inaccuracy, if
corrected, would have led to the application of a higher Applicable Percentage
for any period (an "Applicable Period") than the Applicable Percentage applied
for such Applicable Period, then the Borrower shall immediately (i) deliver to
the Administrative Agent a corrected compliance certificate for such Applicable
Period, (ii) determine the Applicable Percentage for such Applicable Period
based upon the corrected compliance certificate, and (iii) immediately pay to
the Administrative Agent the accrued additional interest owing as a result of
such increased Applicable Percentage for such Applicable Period, which payment
shall be promptly applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section

         Amount") for the purposes hereinafter set forth; provided, however,
         that (i) with regard to each Revolving Lender individually, the sum of
         such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the

         Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of outstanding
         Swingline Loans plus such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment
         Percentage of outstanding LOC Obligations shall not exceed such
         Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment and (ii) with regard to the

         amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus outstanding Swingline Loans
         plus outstanding LOC Obligations shall not exceed the Revolving
         Committed Amount then in effect. Revolving Loans may consist of
         Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans, or a combination
         thereof, as the Borrower may request, and may be repaid and reborrowed
         in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided, however, the
         Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3)
         Business Days following the Closing Date, may only consist of Alternate
         Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower delivers a funding indemnity
         letter, substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.1(a), reasonably

                  (b) Revolving Loan Borrowings.

                           (i) Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall request a
                  Revolving Loan borrowing by delivering a written Notice of
                  Borrowing (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing

                  may be by fax) to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00
                  P.M. on the Business Day prior to the date of the requested
                  borrowing in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and on the
                  third Business Day prior to the date of the requested
                  borrowing in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans. Each such Notice of
                  Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a

                  Loans or a combination thereof, and if LIBOR Rate Loans are

                  shall fail to specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (1) an
                  applicable Interest Period in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan,
                  then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for an
                  Interest Period of one month, or (2) the Type of Revolving
                  Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
                  request for an Alternate Base Rate Loan hereunder. The
                  Administrative Agent shall give notice to each Revolving
                  Lender promptly upon receipt of each Notice of Borrowing, the

                  is made as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate
                  amount of $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000

                  Committed Amount, if less).

                           (iii) Advances. Each Revolving Lender will make its
                  Revolving Commitment Percentage of each Revolving Loan
                  borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the
                  account of the Borrower at the office of the Administrative
                  Agent specified in Section 9.2, or at such other office as the

                  Dollars and in funds immediately available to the
                  Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made
                  available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent by
                  crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of such
                  office (or such other account that the Borrower may designate
                  in writing to the Administrative Agent) with the aggregate of
                  the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the
                  Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by the
                  Administrative Agent.

                  (c) Repayment. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,

         in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein,
         each Term Loan Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees to make
         available to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent) on the
         Closing Date such Term Loan Lender's Term Loan Commitment Percentage of
         a term loan in Dollars (the "Term Loan") in the aggregate principal
         amount of TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($225,000,000) (the
         "Term Loan Committed Amount") for the purposes hereinafter set forth.
         Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of the Term
         Loan, such proceeds will then be made available to the Borrower by the
         Administrative Agent by crediting the account of the Borrower on the
         books of the office of the Administrative Agent specified in Section
         9.2, or at such other office as the Administrative Agent may designate
         in writing, with the aggregate of such proceeds made available to the
         Administrative Agent by the Term Loan Lenders and in like funds as
         received by the Administrative Agent (or by crediting such other
         account(s) as directed by the Borrower). The Term Loan may consist of
         Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans, or a combination
         thereof, as the Borrower may request; provided, however, that the Term
         Loan made on the Closing Date or any of the two (2) Business Days
         following the Closing Date, may only consist of Alternate Base Rate
         Loans unless the Borrower delivers a funding indemnity letter,
         substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.1(a), reasonably acceptable to
         the Administrative Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
         the Closing Date. LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made by each Term Loan
         Lender at its LIBOR Lending Office and Alternate Base Rate Loans at its
         Domestic Lending Office. Amounts repaid or prepaid on the Term Loan may
         not be reborrowed.

                  (b) Repayment of Term Loan. The principal amount of the Term
         Loan shall be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments as follows,
         unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 7.2:

</TABLE>

                  (c) Interest on the Term Loan. Subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.8, the Term Loan shall bear interest as follows:

                           (i) Alternate Base Rate Loans. During such periods as
                  the Term Loan shall be comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans,
                  each such Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a
                  per annum rate equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate
                  plus the Applicable Percentage; and

                           (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans. During such periods as the
                  Term Loan shall be comprised of LIBOR Rate Loans, each such
                  LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal
                  to the sum of the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

                           Interest on the Term Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date.

                  (d) Term Loan Notes; Covenant to Pay. The Borrower's
         obligation to pay each Term Loan Lender shall be evidenced by this
         Agreement and, upon such Term Loan Lender's request, by a duly executed
         promissory note of the Borrower to such Term Loan Lender in
         substantially the form of Exhibit 2.2(d). The Borrower covenants and
         agrees to pay the Term Loan in accordance with the terms of this
         Agreement.

                  (e) Incremental Term Loan. Subject to the terms and conditions
         set forth herein, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time and
         from time to time (but not to exceed two (2) increases in the
         aggregate) prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date, to incur additional
         Indebtedness under this Credit Agreement in the form of an increase to
         the Term Loan Committed Amount (each an "Incremental Term Facility") by
         an aggregate amount of up to SEVENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
         ($75,000,000). The following terms and conditions shall apply to each
         Incremental Term Facility: (i) the loans made under any such
         Incremental Term Facility (each an "Additional Term Loan") shall
         constitute Credit Party Obligations and will be secured and guaranteed
         with the other Credit Party Obligations on a pari passu basis, (ii) the
         yield on such Incremental Term Facility (taking into account upfront
         fees payable to the Lenders making such Incremental Term Facility) may
         be higher than the then-current interest rate margin on the Term Loans,
         but by no more than 0.50% (it being understood that the existing Term
         Loan pricing will be increased and/or additional fees will be paid to
         existing Term Loan Lenders to the extent necessary to satisfy such
         requirement), (iii) any such Incremental Term Facility shall have a
         maturity date no sooner than, and a weighted average life to maturity
         no shorter than, the Term Loan Maturity Date and the weighted average
         life to maturity of the Term Loans, respectively, (iv) any such
         Incremental Term Facility shall be entitled to the same voting rights
         as the existing Term Loans and shall be entitled to receive proceeds of
         prepayments on the same basis as the existing Term Loans, (v) any such
         Incremental Term Facility shall be obtained from existing Lenders or
         from other banks, financial institutions or investment funds, in each
         case in accordance with the terms set forth below, (vi) any such
         Incremental Term Facility shall be in a minimum principal amount of
         $20,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,
         (vii) the proceeds of any Additional Term Loan will be used for the
         purposes set forth in Section 3.11, (viii) the Borrower shall execute a
         Term Note in favor of any new Lender or any existing Lender requesting
         a Term Note whose Term Loan Committed Amount is increased, (ix) the
         conditions to Extensions of Credit in Section 4.2 shall have been
         satisfied, (x) the Administrative Agent shall have received an opinion
         or opinions (including, if reasonably requested by the Administrative
         Agent, local counsel opinions) of counsel for the Credit Parties,
         addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in form and
         substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and (xi)
         the Administrative Agent shall have received from the Borrower updated
         financial projections and an officer's certificate, in each case in
         form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
         demonstrating that, after giving effect to any such Incremental Term
         Facility on a Pro Forma Basis, the Borrower will be in compliance with
         the financial covenants set forth in Section 5.9 notwithstanding
         whether the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is otherwise required to be
         calculated pursuant to Section 5.9 at such time. The Administrative
         Agent is authorized to enter into, on behalf of the Lenders, any
         amendment to this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document as may
         be necessary to incorporate the terms of any new Incremental Term
         Facility therein.

         Section 2.3       Letter of Credit Subfacility.

                  (a) Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and
         of the LOC Documents, if any, and any other terms and conditions which
         the Issuing Lender may reasonably require, during the Commitment Period
         the Issuing Lender shall issue, and the Revolving Lenders shall
         participate in, standby Letters of Credit for the account of the
         Borrower from time to time upon request in a form reasonably acceptable
         to the Issuing Lender; provided, however, that (i) the aggregate amount
         of LOC Obligations shall not at any time exceed FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
         ($5,000,000) (the "LOC Committed Amount"), (ii) the sum of the
         aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus
         outstanding Swingline Loans plus outstanding LOC Obligations shall not
         at any time exceed the Revolving Committed Amount then in effect, (iii)
         all Letters of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars and (iv) Letters
         of Credit shall be issued for any lawful corporate purposes and shall
         be issued as standby letters of credit, including in connection with
         workers' compensation and other insurance programs. Except as otherwise
         expressly agreed upon by all the Revolving Lenders, no Letter of Credit
         shall have an original expiry date more than twelve (12) months from
         the date of issuance; provided, however, so long as no Default or Event
         of Default has occurred and is continuing and subject to the other
         terms and conditions to the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder,
         the expiry dates of Letters of Credit may be extended annually or
         periodically from time to time on the request of the Borrower or by
         operation of the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit to a date not
         more than twelve (12) months from the date of extension; provided,
         further, that no Letter of Credit, as originally issued or as extended,
         shall have an expiry date extending beyond the date that is thirty (30)
         days prior to the Revolver Maturity Date. Each Letter of Credit shall
         comply with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry date of
         each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day. Each Letter of Credit
         issued hereunder shall be in a minimum original face amount of $500,000
         or such lesser amount as approved by the Issuing Lender.

                  (b) Notice and Reports. The request for the issuance of a
         Letter of Credit shall be submitted to the Issuing Lender at least five
         (5) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance. The Issuing
         Lender will promptly upon request provide to the Administrative Agent
         for dissemination to the Revolving Lenders a detailed report specifying
         the Letters of Credit which are then issued and outstanding and any
         activity with respect thereto which may have occurred since the date of
         any prior report, and including therein, among other things, the
         account party, the beneficiary, the face amount, expiry date as well as
         any payments or expirations which may have occurred. The Issuing Lender
         will further provide to the Administrative Agent promptly upon request
         copies of the Letters of Credit. The Issuing Lender will provide to the
         Administrative Agent promptly upon request a summary report of the
         nature and extent of LOC Obligations then outstanding.

                  (c) Participations. Each Revolving Lender upon issuance of a
         Letter of Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a
         risk participation from the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and
         the obligations arising thereunder and any Collateral relating thereto,
         in each case in an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage
         of the obligations under such Letter of Credit and shall absolutely,
         unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as
         surety, and be obligated to pay to the Issuing Lender therefor and
         discharge when due, its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the
         obligations arising under such Letter of Credit; provided that any
         Person that becomes a Revolving Lender after the Closing Date shall be
         deemed to have purchased a Participation Interest in all outstanding
         Letters of Credit on the date it becomes a Lender hereunder and any
         Letter of Credit issued on or after such date, in each case in
         accordance with the foregoing terms. Without limiting the scope and
         nature of each Revolving Lender's participation in any Letter of
         Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed
         as required hereunder or under any LOC Document, each such Revolving
         Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender its Revolving Commitment
         Percentage of such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds pursuant to
         and in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) hereof. The
         obligation of each Revolving Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender
         shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the
         occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any other occurrence or
         event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
         obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender under any
         Letter of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter provided.

                  (d) Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any
         Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower
         and the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing
         Lender on the day of drawing under any Letter of Credit if notified
         prior to 3:00 P.M. on a Business Day or, if after 3:00 P.M., on the
         following Business Day (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan
         obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds as provided herein
         or in the LOC Documents. If the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the
         Issuing Lender as provided herein, the unreimbursed amount of such
         drawing shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the ABR
         Default Rate. Unless the Borrower shall immediately, and in any event
         within one (1) hour of the receipt by the Borrower of notification of
         any drawing, notify the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent of
         its intent to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender, the Borrower
         shall be deemed to have requested a Mandatory LOC Borrowing in the
         amount of the drawing as provided in subsection (e) hereof, the
         proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the Reimbursement
         Obligations. The Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations hereunder shall
         be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of
         any rights of set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower
         may claim or have against the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent,
         the Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any
         other Person, including without limitation any defense based on any
         failure of the Borrower to receive consideration or the legality,
         validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The
         Issuing Lender will promptly notify the other Revolving Lenders of the
         amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each Revolving Lender shall
         promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
         Lender, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, the amount of
         such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of such
         unreimbursed drawing. Such payment shall be made on the day such notice
         is received by such Revolving Lender from the Issuing Lender if such
         notice is received at or before 2:00 P.M., otherwise such payment shall
         be made at or before 12:00 P.M. on the Business Day next succeeding the
         day such notice is received. If such Revolving Lender does not pay such
         amount to the Issuing Lender in full upon such request, such Revolving
         Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent for the
         account of the Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the
         period from the date of such drawing until such Revolving Lender pays
         such amount to the Issuing Lender in full at a rate per annum equal to,
         if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of drawing, the
         Federal Funds Effective Rate and thereafter at a rate equal to the
         Alternate Base Rate. Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make such
         payment to the Issuing Lender, and the right of the Issuing Lender to
         receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be
         affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the
         termination of this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the
         existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the
         Credit Party Obligations hereunder and shall be made without any
         offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which the
         Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a
         Revolving Loan to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the
         Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Revolving Lenders that a
         Revolving Loan has been requested or deemed requested in connection
         with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan
         borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans (each such
         borrowing, a "Mandatory LOC Borrowing") shall be made (without giving
         effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2)
         pro rata based on each Revolving Lender's respective Revolving
         Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
         termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2) and the
         proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Issuing Lender for
         application to the respective LOC Obligations. Each Revolving Lender
         hereby irrevocably agrees to make such Revolving Loans on the day such
         notice is received by the Revolving Lenders from the Administrative
         Agent if such notice is received at or before 2:00 P.M., otherwise such
         payment shall be made at or before 12:00 P.M. on the Business Day next
         succeeding the day such notice is received, in each case
         notwithstanding (i) the amount of Mandatory LOC Borrowing may not
         comply with the minimum amount for borrowings of Revolving Loans
         otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in
         Section 4.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of
         Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed
         request for Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required in
         Section 2.1(b), (v) the date of such Mandatory LOC Borrowing, or (vi)
         any reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount after any such Letter
         of Credit may have been drawn upon. In the event that any Mandatory LOC
         Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required
         above (including, without limitation, as a result of the occurrence of
         a Bankruptcy Event), then each such Revolving Lender hereby agrees that
         it shall forthwith fund (as of the date the Mandatory LOC Borrowing
         would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received
         from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) its
         Participation Interests in the outstanding LOC Obligations; provided,
         further, that in the event any Revolving Lender shall fail to fund its
         Participation Interest on the day the Mandatory LOC Borrowing would
         otherwise have occurred, then the amount of such Revolving Lender's
         unfunded Participation Interest therein shall bear interest payable by
         such Revolving Lender to the Issuing Lender upon demand, at the rate
         equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of such date, the
         Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the
         Alternate Base Rate.

                  (f) Modification, Extension. The issuance of any supplement,
         modification, amendment, renewal, or extension to any Letter of Credit
         shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as the
         issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

                  (g) ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing
         Lender and the Borrower, when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules
         of the "International Standby Practices 1998," published by the
         Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later
         version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall
         apply to each standby Letter of Credit.

                  (h) Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict
         between this Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of
         credit application), this Agreement shall control.

                  (i) Designation of Subsidiaries as Account Parties.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
         including without limitation Section 2.3(a), a Letter of Credit issued
         hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter of
         Credit is issued for the account of a Subsidiary of the Borrower;
         provided that, notwithstanding such statement, the Borrower shall be
         the actual account party for all purposes of this Agreement for such
         Letter of Credit and such statement shall not affect the Borrower's
         Reimbursement Obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of
         Credit.

         Section 2.4       Swingline Loan Subfacility.

                  (a) Swingline Commitment. During the Commitment Period,
         subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender, in
         its individual capacity, agrees to make certain revolving credit loans
         to the Borrower (each a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the
         "Swingline Loans") for the purposes hereinafter set forth; provided,
         however, (i) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans
         outstanding at any time shall not exceed FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
         ($5,000,000) (the "Swingline Committed Amount"), and (ii) the sum of
         the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus
         outstanding Swingline Loans plus outstanding LOC Obligations shall not
         exceed the Revolving Committed Amount then in effect. Swingline Loans
         hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the
         provisions hereof.

                  (b) Swingline Loan Borrowings.

                           (i) Notice of Borrowing and Disbursement. Upon
                  receiving a Notice of Borrowing from the Borrower not later
                  than 1:00 P.M. on any Business Day requesting that a Swingline
                  Loan be made, the Swingline Lender will make Swingline Loans
                  available to the Borrower on the same Business Day such
                  request is received by the Administrative Agent. Swingline
                  Loan borrowings hereunder shall be made in minimum amounts of
                  $500,000 (or the remaining available amount of the Swingline
                  Committed Amount if less) and in integral amounts of $100,000
                  in excess thereof.

                           (ii) Repayment of Swingline Loans. Each Swingline
                  Loan borrowing shall be due and payable on the Revolver
                  Maturity Date. The Swingline Lender may, at any time, in its
                  sole discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans
                  by way of a Revolving Loan borrowing, in which case the
                  Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan
                  borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans in
                  the amount of such Swingline Loans; provided, however, that,
                  in the following circumstances, any such demand shall also be
                  deemed to have been given one Business Day prior to each of
                  (A) the Revolver Maturity Date, (B) the occurrence of any
                  Bankruptcy Event, (C) upon acceleration of the Credit Party
                  Obligations hereunder, whether on account of a Bankruptcy
                  Event or any other Event of Default, and (D) the exercise of
                  remedies in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2
                  hereof (each such Revolving Loan borrowing made on account of
                  any such deemed request therefor as provided herein being
                  hereinafter referred to as "Mandatory Swingline Borrowing").
                  Each Revolving Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make such
                  Revolving Loans promptly upon any such request or deemed
                  request on account of each Mandatory Swingline Borrowing in
                  the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding
                  sentence on the date such notice is received by the Revolving
                  Lenders from the Administrative Agent if such notice is
                  received at or before 2:00 P.M., otherwise such payment shall
                  be made at or before 12:00 P.M. on the Business Day next
                  succeeding the date such notice is received notwithstanding
                  (1) the amount of Mandatory Swingline Borrowing may not comply
                  with the minimum amount for borrowings of Revolving Loans
                  otherwise required hereunder, (2) whether any conditions
                  specified in Section 4.2 are then satisfied, (3) whether a
                  Default or an Event of Default then exists, (4) failure of any
                  such request or deemed request for Revolving Loans to be made
                  by the time otherwise required in Section 2.1(b)(i), (5) the
                  date of such Mandatory Swingline Borrowing, or (6) any
                  reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount or termination of
                  the Revolving Commitments immediately prior to such Mandatory
                  Swingline Borrowing or contemporaneously therewith. In the
                  event that any Mandatory Swingline Borrowing cannot for any
                  reason be made on the date otherwise required above
                  (including, without limitation, as a result of the
                  commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code), then
                  each Revolving Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith
                  purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Swingline Borrowing
                  would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
                  received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to
                  such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such Participation
                  Interest in the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be
                  necessary to cause each such Revolving Lender to share in such
                  Swingline Loans ratably based upon its respective Revolving
                  Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
                  termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2);
                  provided that (x) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans
                  shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until the
                  date as of which the respective Participation Interest is
                  purchased, and (y) at the time any purchase of a Participation
                  Interest pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the
                  purchasing Revolving Lender shall be required to pay to the
                  Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of such
                  Participation Interest purchased for each day from and
                  including the day upon which the Mandatory Swingline Borrowing
                  would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of
                  payment for such Participation Interest, at the rate equal to,
                  if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of the
                  Mandatory Swingline Borrowing, the Federal Funds Effective
                  Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base
                  Rate. The Borrower shall have the right to repay the Swingline
                  Loan in whole or in part from time to time without premium or
                  penalty; provided, however; that each partial repayment of a
                  Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum principal amount of
                  $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof
                  (or the remaining outstanding principal amount).

                  (c) Interest on Swingline Loans. Subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.8, Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate
         equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage for
         Revolving Loans that are Alternate Base Rate Loans. Interest on
         Swingline Loans shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
         Date.

                  (d) Swingline Note; Covenant to Pay. The Swingline Loans shall
         be evidenced by this Agreement and, upon request of the Swingline
         Lender, by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower in favor of
         the Swingline Lender in the original amount of the Swingline Committed
         Amount and substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.4(d). The Borrower
         covenants and agrees to pay the Swingline Loans in accordance with the
         terms of this Agreement.

         Section 2.5       Fees.

                  (a) Commitment Fee. In consideration of the Revolving
         Commitments, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
         for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Lenders, a commitment fee (the
         "Commitment Fee") in an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage per
         annum on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Committed
         Amount. For purposes of computation of the Commitment Fee, LOC
         Obligations shall be considered usage of the Revolving Committed Amount
         but Swingline Loans shall not be considered usage of the Revolving
         Committed Amount. The Commitment Fee shall be (i) payable quarterly in
         arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the
         Revolver Maturity Date and (ii) non-refundable.

                  (b) Letter of Credit Fees. In consideration of the LOC
         Commitments, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
         for the ratable benefit of the Revolving Lenders, a fee (the "Letter of
         Credit Fee") equal to the Applicable Percentage for Revolving Loans
         that are LIBOR Rate Loans per annum on the average daily maximum amount
         available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit from the date of
         issuance to the date of expiration. The Letter of Credit Fee shall be
         (i) payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
         calendar quarter and on the Revolver Maturity Date and (ii)
         non-refundable.

                  (c) Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the Letter of Credit
         Fees payable pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the Borrower shall pay
         to the Issuing Lender for its own account without sharing by the other
         Lenders the reasonable and customary charges from time to time of the
         Issuing Lender with respect to the amendment, transfer, administration,
         cancellation and conversion of, and drawings under, such Letters of
         Credit (collectively, the "Issuing Lender Fees"). The Issuing Lender
         may charge, and retain for its own account without sharing by the other
         Lenders, an additional facing fee (the "Letter of Credit Facing Fee")
         of 0.25% per annum on the average daily maximum amount available to be
         drawn under each such Letter of Credit issued by it. The Issuing Lender
         Fees and the Letter of Credit Facing Fee shall be (i) payable quarterly
         in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the
         Revolver Maturity Date and (ii) non-refundable.

                  (d) Administrative Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent the annual administrative fee as described in the
         Fee Letter.

         Section 2.6       Commitment Reductions.

                  (a) Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower shall have the right to
         terminate or permanently reduce the unused portion of the Revolving
         Committed Amount at any time or from time to time upon not less than
         five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative
         Agent (which shall notify the Lenders thereof as soon as practicable)
         of each such termination or reduction, which notice shall specify the
         effective date thereof and the amount of any such reduction which shall
         be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000
         in excess thereof and shall be irrevocable and effective upon receipt
         by the Administrative Agent; provided that no such reduction or
         termination shall be permitted if after giving effect thereto, and to
         any prepayments of the Revolving Loans made on the effective date
         thereof, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
         Revolving Loans plus outstanding Swingline Loans plus outstanding LOC
         Obligations would exceed the Revolving Committed Amount then in effect.

                  (b) Swingline Committed Amount. If the Revolving Committed
         Amount is reduced below the then current Swingline Committed Amount,
         the Swingline Committed Amount shall automatically be reduced by an
         amount such that the Swingline Committed Amount equals the Revolving
         Committed Amount.

                  (c) Maturity Date. The Revolving Commitments, the Swingline
         Commitment and the LOC Commitment shall automatically terminate on the
         Revolver Maturity Date.

         Section 2.7       Prepayments.

                  (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to
         prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time; provided, however,
         that each partial prepayment of a Term Loan shall be in a minimum
         principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
         excess thereof (or the remaining outstanding principal amount). The
         Borrower shall give three Business Days' irrevocable notice of
         prepayment in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans and same-day irrevocable
         notice on any Business Day in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, to
         the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the Lenders thereof as
         soon as practicable). To the extent that the Borrower elects to prepay
         the Term Loans, amounts prepaid under this Section shall be applied
         ratably to the remaining principal installments thereof. Within the
         foregoing parameters, prepayments under this Section shall be applied
         first to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in
         direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this
         Section shall be subject to Section 2.14, but otherwise without premium
         or penalty. Interest on the principal amount prepaid shall be payable
         on the next occurring Interest Payment Date that would have occurred
         had such loan not been prepaid or, at the request of the Administrative
         Agent, interest on the principal amount prepaid shall be payable on any
         date that a prepayment is made hereunder through the date of
         prepayment.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i) Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time after
                  the Closing Date, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of
                  outstanding Revolving Loans plus outstanding Swingline Loans
                  plus outstanding LOC Obligations shall exceed the Revolving
                  Committed Amount, the Borrower shall immediately prepay the
                  Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans and (after all Revolving
                  Loans and Swingline Loans have been repaid) cash collateralize
                  the LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate such
                  excess (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause
                  (vii) below.

                           (ii) Asset Dispositions. Promptly following any Asset
                  Disposition (or related series of Asset Dispositions), the
                  Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or cash collateralize the
                  LOC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to one hundred
                  percent (100%) of the Net Cash Proceeds derived from such
                  Asset Disposition (or related series of Asset Dispositions)
                  (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vii)
                  below); provided, however, that, so long as no Default or
                  Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Net Cash
                  Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied to the extent
                  the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a
                  certificate stating that the Credit Parties intend to use such
                  Net Cash Proceeds to acquire like assets useful to the
                  business of the Credit Parties within 180 days of the receipt
                  of such Net Cash Proceeds, it being expressly agreed that Net
                  Cash Proceeds not so reinvested shall be applied to prepay the
                  Loans and/or cash collateralize the LOC Obligations
                  immediately thereafter (such prepayment to be applied as set
                  forth in clause (vii) below).

                           (iii) Debt Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by any
                  Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from any
                  Debt Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or cash
                  collateralize the LOC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
                  to one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Cash Proceeds of such
                  Debt Issuance (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in
                  clause (vii) below).

                           (iv) Issuances of Equity. Immediately upon receipt by
                  any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from
                  any Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
                  and/or cash collateralize the LOC Obligations in an aggregate
                  amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Cash Proceeds
                  of such Equity Issuance (such prepayment to be applied as set
                  forth in clause (vii) below).

                           (v) Excess Cash Flow. Within 90 days after the end of
                  each fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending
                  2007), if the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the
                  end of such fiscal year is (A) equal to or greater than 5.00
                  to 1.0, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and cash
                  collateralize the LOC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
                  to 50% of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year (such
                  prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (vii) below),
                  (B) equal to or greater than 4.00 to 1.0 but less than 5.00 to
                  1.0, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and cash
                  collateralize the LOC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
                  to 25% of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year (such
                  prepayments to be applied as set forth in clause (vii) below),
                  and (C) less than 4.00 to 1.0, then no annual Excess Cash Flow
                  prepayment shall be required.

                           (vi) Extraordinary Receipt. Immediately upon receipt
                  by any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds
                  from any Extraordinary Receipt, the Borrower shall prepay the
                  Loans and/or cash collateralize LOC Obligations in an
                  aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
                  Net Cash Proceeds of such Extraordinary Receipt (such
                  prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vii) below);
                  provided, however, that, so long as no Default or Event of
                  Default has occurred and is continuing, such Net Cash Proceeds
                  shall not be required to be so applied to the extent the
                  Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a certificate
                  stating that Credit Parties intend to use such Net Cash
                  Proceeds to acquire assets useful to the business of the
                  Credit Parties within 180 days of the receipt of such Net Cash
                  Proceeds, it being expressly agreed that any Net Cash Proceeds
                  not so reinvested shall be applied to prepay the Loans and/or
                  cash collateralize the LOC Obligations immediately thereafter
                  (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vii)
                  below).

                           (vii) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All
                  amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section shall be
                  applied as follows:

                                    (A) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                           pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(i), (1) first to the
                           outstanding Swingline Loans, (2) second to the
                           outstanding Revolving Loans and (3) third to cash
                           collateralize the LOC Obligations; and

                                    (B) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                           pursuant to Sections 2.7(b)(ii) through (vi), (1)
                           first to the Term Loan (ratably to the remaining
                           amortization payments thereof), (2) second to the
                           Swingline Loans (without a corresponding reduction of
                           the Swingline Committed Amount), (3) third to the
                           Revolving Loans (without a corresponding reduction of
                           the Revolving Committed Amount) and (4) fourth to a
                           cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations
                           (without a corresponding reduction of the LOC
                           Committed Amount). Within the parameters of the
                           applications set forth above, prepayments shall be
                           applied first to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then
                           to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct order of Interest
                           Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section
                           shall be subject to Section 2.14 and be accompanied
                           by interest on the principal amount prepaid through
                           the date of prepayment, but otherwise without premium
                           or penalty.

                  (c) Hedging Obligations Unaffected. Any repayment or
         prepayment made pursuant to this Section shall not affect the
         Borrower's obligation to continue to make payments under any Secured
         Hedging Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
         notwithstanding such repayment or prepayment, subject to the terms of
         such Secured Hedging Agreement.

         Section 2.8       Default Rate and Payment Dates.

                  (a) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan
         which is a LIBOR Rate Loan shall not be paid when due or continued as a
         LIBOR Rate Loan in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9
         (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such
         overdue principal amount of such Loan shall be converted to an
         Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable
         thereto.

                  (b) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any
         LIBOR Rate Loan shall not be paid when due, such overdue amount shall
         bear interest at a rate per annum which is equal to the rate that would
         otherwise be applicable thereto plus 2%, until the end of the Interest
         Period applicable thereto, and thereafter at a rate per annum which is
         equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the sum of the Applicable
         Percentage then in effect for Alternate Base Rate Loans and 2% (the
         "ABR Default Rate") or (ii) if any interest payable on the principal
         amount of any Loan or any fee or other amount, including the principal
         amount of any Alternate Base Rate Loan, payable hereunder shall not be
         paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or
         otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum
         which is equal to the ABR Default Rate, in each case from the date of
         such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (after as well as
         before judgment). Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of
         any other Event of Default hereunder, at the option of the Required
         Lenders, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest
         on the Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other
         Credit Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum
         rate which is (A) in the case of principal, the rate that would
         otherwise be applicable thereto plus 2% or (B) in the case of interest,
         fees or other amounts, the ABR Default Rate (after as well as before
         judgment).

                  (c) Interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
         Interest Payment Date; provided that interest accruing pursuant to
         paragraph (b) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on
         demand.

         Section 2.9       Conversion Options.

                  (a) The Borrower may, in the case of Revolving Loans and the
         Term Loan, elect from time to time to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans
         to LIBOR Rate Loans, by delivering a Notice of Conversion/Extension to
         the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior to the
         proposed date of conversion. In addition, the Borrower may elect from
         time to time to convert all or any portion of a LIBOR Rate Loan to an
         Alternate Base Rate Loan by giving the Administrative Agent irrevocable
         written notice thereof by 1:00 P.M. one (1) Business Day prior to the
         proposed date of conversion. If the date upon which an Alternate Base
         Rate Loan is to be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan is not a Business
         Day, then such conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Business
         Day and during the period from such last day of an Interest Period to
         such succeeding Business Day such Loan shall bear interest as if it
         were an Alternate Base Rate Loan. LIBOR Rate Loans may only be
         converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans on the last day of the
         applicable Interest Period. If the date upon which a LIBOR Rate Loan is
         to be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Loan is not a Business Day,
         then such conversion shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day
         and during the period from such last day of an Interest Period to such
         succeeding Business Day such Loan shall bear interest as if it were an
         Alternate Base Rate Loan. All or any part of outstanding Alternate Base
         Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein; provided that (i) no
         Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan when any Default or Event
         of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) partial conversions
         shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole
         multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. All or any part of outstanding
         LIBOR Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein; provided that
         partial conversions shall be in an aggregate principal amount of
         $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

                  (b) Any LIBOR Rate Loans may be continued as such upon the
         expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by
         the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in Section 2.9(a);
         provided, that no LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such when any
         Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which
         case such Loan shall be automatically converted to an Alternate Base
         Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period with respect
         thereto. If the Borrower shall fail to give timely notice of an
         election to continue a LIBOR Rate Loan, or the continuation of LIBOR
         Rate Loans is not permitted hereunder, such LIBOR Rate Loans shall be
         automatically converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans at the end of the
         applicable Interest Period with respect thereto.

         Section 2.10      Computation of Interest and Fees; Usury.

                  (a) Interest payable hereunder with respect to any Alternate
         Base Rate Loan based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis
         of a year of 365 days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days
         elapsed. All other fees, interest and all other amounts payable
         hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the
         actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination
         of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof. Any
         change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the
         Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of
         business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate
         shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date
         and the amount of each such change.

                  (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall
         be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the
         absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the
         request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing
         the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any
         interest rate.

                  (c) It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to
         conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law
         from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the
         Credit Parties are hereby limited by the provisions of this subsection
         which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now
         existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no way,
         nor in any event or contingency (including, but not limited to,
         prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any Credit Party
         Obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for,
         charged, or received under this Agreement, under the Notes or
         otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under
         applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit
         Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in
         excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall
         be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such interest shall
         be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted
         under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any
         amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of
         value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable
         law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the
         maximum nonusurious amount, an amount equal to the amount which would
         have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the
         reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the
         payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor
         thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been
         excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right
         to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by
         any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any
         interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand,
         and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned
         interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be
         paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
         spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or
         extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of
         such Indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount
         permitted by applicable law.

         Section 2.11      Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.

                  (a) Allocation of Payments Prior to Exercise of Remedies. Each
         borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction of the Revolving
         Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective
         Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Revolving Lenders. Unless
         otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement, each payment under
         this Agreement or any Note shall be applied, first, to any fees then
         due and owing by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.5, second, to
         interest then due and owing hereunder and under the Notes of the
         Borrower and, third, to principal then due and owing hereunder and
         under the Notes of the Borrower. Each payment on account of any fees
         pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be made pro rata in accordance with the
         respective amounts due and owing (except as to the Letter of Credit
         Facing Fees and the Issuing Lender Fees). Each payment (other than
         prepayments) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on
         the Revolving Loans and on the Term Loan, as applicable, shall be
         applied to such Loans, as applicable, on a pro rata basis in accordance
         with the terms of Section 2.7(a) hereof. Each optional prepayment on
         account of principal of the Loans shall be applied in accordance with
         Section 2.7(a). Each mandatory prepayment on account of principal of
         the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.7(b). All
         payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account
         of principal, interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off
         or counterclaim (except as provided in Section 2.16(b)) and shall be
         made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the
         Administrative Agent's office specified on Section 9.2 in Dollars and
         in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date
         when due. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to
         the Lenders entitled thereto promptly upon receipt in like funds as
         received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR
         Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
         such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
         and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be
         payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any
         payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other
         than a Business Day, such payment date shall be extended to the next
         succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to
         extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such
         payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

                  (b) Allocation of Payments After Exercise of Remedies.
         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
         after the exercise of remedies (other than the invocation of default
         interest pursuant to Section 2.8) by the Administrative Agent or the
         Lenders pursuant to Section 7.2 (or after the Commitments shall
         automatically terminate and the Loans (with accrued interest thereon)
         and all other amounts under the Credit Documents (including without
         limitation the maximum amount of all contingent liabilities under
         Letters of Credit) shall automatically become due and payable in
         accordance with the terms of such Section), all amounts collected or
         received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the
         Credit Party Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of
         the Credit Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over
         or delivered as follows (irrespective of whether the following costs,
         expenses, fees, interest, premiums, scheduled periodic payments or
         Credit Party Obligations are allowed, permitted or recognized as a
         claim in any proceeding resulting from the occurrence of a Bankruptcy
         Event):

                           FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection
                  with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit
                  Documents and any protective advances made by the
                  Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral under or
                  pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents;

                           SECOND, to the payment of any fees owed to the
                  Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender

                           THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with
                  enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise
                  with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such
                  Lender;

                           FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party
                  Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest, and
                  including, with respect to any Secured Hedging Agreement, any
                  fees, premiums and scheduled periodic payments due under such
                  Secured Hedging Agreement and any interest accrued thereon;

                           FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal
                  amount of the Credit Party Obligations and the payment or cash
                  collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations, and
                  including with respect to any Secured Hedging Agreement, any
                  breakage, termination or other payments due under such Secured
                  Hedging Agreement and any interest accrued thereon;

                           SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and
                  other obligations which shall have become due and payable
                  under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid
                  pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and

                           SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

                  In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be
         applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to
         application to the next succeeding category; (b) each of the Lenders
         and any Hedging Agreement Provider shall receive an amount equal to its
         pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans
         and LOC Obligations held by such Lender or the outstanding obligations
         payable to such Hedging Agreement Provider bears to the aggregate then
         outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations and obligations payable under all
         Secured Hedging Agreements) of amounts available to be applied pursuant
         to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above; and (c) to the
         extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause
         "FIFTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of
         outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the
         Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (i)
         first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time for any
         drawings under such Letters of Credit and (ii) then, following the
         expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the
         types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner
         provided in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this
         Section, only Collateral proceeds and payments under the Guaranty (as
         opposed to ordinary course principal, interest and fee payments
         hereunder) shall be applied to obligations under any Secured Hedging
         Agreement.

         Section 2.12      Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

                  (a) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.
         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from
         a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Extension of Credit that
         such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
         Lender's share of such Extension of Credit, the Administrative Agent
         may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date
         in accordance with this Agreement and may, in reliance upon such
         assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In
         such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
         applicable Extension of Credit available to the Administrative Agent,
         then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to
         the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
         with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
         amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of
         payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to
         be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
         and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
         banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case
         of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable
         to Alternate Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay
         such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an
         overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to
         the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such
         period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Extension of
         Credit to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall
         constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Extension of Credit. Any
         payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the
         Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
         payment to the Administrative Agent.

                  (b) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative
         Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
         the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing
         Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment
         on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
         assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the
         case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in
         fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender,
         as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
         Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or
         the Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and
         including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding
         the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
         Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
         Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
         interbank compensation.

                  A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the
         Borrower with respect to any amount owing under subsections (a) and (b)
         of this Section shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

                  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender
         makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be
         made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
         Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by
         the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
         Extension of Credit set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived
         in accordance with the terms thereof, the Administrative Agent shall
         return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such
         Lender, without interest.

                  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the
         Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans, to fund
         participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make
         payments pursuant to Section 9.5(c) are several and not joint. The
         failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation
         or to make any such payment under Section 9.5(c) on any date required
         hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding
         obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible
         for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase
         its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.5(c).

                  (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate
         any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
         manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has
         obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place
         or manner.

         Section 2.13      Inability to Determine Interest Rate.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (a) the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, or (b) the Required
Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the
Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR Tranche during such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such
determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower, and the Lenders at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period. Unless the
Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such
telephone notice that it wishes to rescind or modify its request regarding such
LIBOR Rate Loans, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans
shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans and any Loans that were requested to
be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall remain as or be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until any such notice has been
withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as,
continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so
affected.

         Section 2.14      Yield Protection.

                  (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

                           (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
                  special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
                  requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
                  account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any
                  Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR
                  Rate) or the Issuing Lender;

                           (ii) subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any
                  tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any
                  Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or
                  any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of
                  taxation of payments to such Lender or the Issuing Lender in
                  respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
                  covered by Section 2.16 and the imposition of, or any change
                  in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the
                  Issuing Lender); or

                           (iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Lender or
                  the London interbank market any other condition, cost or
                  expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by
                  such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit
(or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of
Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any
other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the Issuing Lender, the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

                  (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Lender
         determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the Issuing
         Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender's or the
         Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital
         requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
         return on such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's capital or on the
         capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company, if
         any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender
         or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by,
         such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender, to
         a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such
         Lender's or the Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved
         but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or
         the Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the
         Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy),
         then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the
         Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts
         as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such Lender's
         or the Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction
         suffered.

                  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender
         or the Issuing Lender setting forth, in reasonable detail, the amount
         or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or
         its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a)
         or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or
         the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any
         such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any
         Lender or the Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this
         Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing
         Lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower
         shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Lender
         pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions
         suffered, as the case may be, to the extent that such Lender or the
         Issuing Lender fails to make a demand for such compensation more than
         nine (9) months after becoming aware of such Change in Law giving arise
         to such increased costs or reductions.

         Section 2.15      Indemnity; Eurocurrency Liabilities.

                  (a) The Credit Parties hereby agree to indemnify each Lender
         and to hold such Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which
         such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) the failure by
         the Borrower to pay the principal amount of or interest on any Loan by
         such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, (b) the failure by the
         Borrower to accept a borrowing after the Borrower has given a notice in
         accordance with the terms hereof, (c) default by the Borrower in making
         any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in accordance with
         the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a prepayment
         of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is not the last
         day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, in each case
         including, but not limited to, any such loss or expense arising from
         interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by
         it in order to maintain its Loans hereunder. A certificate setting
         forth in reasonable detail as to any additional amounts payable
         pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender, through the
         Administrative Agent, to the Borrower (which certificate must be
         delivered to the Administrative Agent within thirty days following such
         default, prepayment or conversion) shall be conclusive in the absence
         of manifest error. The agreements in this Section shall survive
         termination of this Agreement and payment of the Credit Party
         Obligations.

                  (b) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such
         Lender shall be required to maintain reserves under Regulation D with
         respect to "Eurocurrency liabilities" within the meaning of Regulation
         D, or under any similar or successor regulation with respect to
         Eurocurrency liabilities or Eurocurrency funding, additional interest
         on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan equal to the actual
         costs of such reserves allocated to such LIBOR Loan by such Lender (as
         determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
         conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which
         interest is payable on such LIBOR Loan, provided the Borrower shall
         have received at least fifteen (15) days prior notice (with a copy to
         the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.
         If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the
         relevant interest payment date, such additional interest shall be due
         and payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.

         Section 2.16      Taxes.

                  (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on
         account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other
         Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction
         or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that
         if the Borrower shall be required by applicable law to deduct any
         Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then
         (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
         making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
         additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent,
         any Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount
         equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
         made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the
         Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
         Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting
         the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay
         any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
         with applicable law.

                  (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall
         indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender,
         within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
         Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
         this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the
         Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and
         reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether
         or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
         imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
         certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
         the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf
         or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive
         absent manifest error.

                  (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any
         payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a
         Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the
         Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
         issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
         of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
         reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to
         an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the
         jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any
         treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments
         hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall deliver to the
         Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or
         times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
         Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
         executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
         payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of
         withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or
         the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation
         prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or
         the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the
         Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject
         to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the
Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States of America, any
Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the
date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and
from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do
so), whichever of the following is applicable:

                           (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service
                  Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax
                  treaty to which the United States of America is a party,

                           (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
                  Service Form W-8ECI,

                           (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the
                  benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section
                  881(c) of the Code, (i) a certificate to the effect that such
                  Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of
                  section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent
                  shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section
                  881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign
                  corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and
                  (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
                  W-8BEN, or

                           (iii) any other form prescribed by applicable law as
                  a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United
                  States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with
                  such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
                  applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the
                  withholding or deduction required to be made.

                  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent,
         a Lender or the Issuing Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that
         it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has
         been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower
         has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to
         the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
         indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower
         under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise
         to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the
         Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case
         may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the
         relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided
         that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such
         Lender or the Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
         the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
         the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such
         Lender or the Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent,
         such Lender or the Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to
         such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to
         require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Lender to
         make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to
         its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other
         Person.

         Section 2.17      Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.

                  (a) In addition to its other obligations under Section 2.3,
         the Credit Parties hereby agree to protect, indemnify, pay and save the
         Issuing Lender and each Lender harmless from and against any and all
         claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and
         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that the Issuing Lender
         or such Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or
         indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit or (ii) the
         failure of the Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under a Letter of
         Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or
         wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or
         Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called
         "Government Acts").

                  (b) As between the Credit Parties, the Issuing Lender and each
         Lender, the Credit Parties shall assume all risks of the acts,
         omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof.
         Neither the Issuing Lender nor any Lender shall be responsible: (i) for
         the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect
         of any document submitted by any party in connection with the
         application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should
         in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
         inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or sufficiency
         of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer
         or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
         proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or
         ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of the beneficiary of a
         Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to
         draw upon a Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors, omissions, interruptions
         or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable,
         telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v)
         for errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) for any loss or
         delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
         order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds
         thereof; and (vii) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the
         control of the Issuing Lender or any Lender, including, without
         limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall affect,
         impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender's rights or powers
         hereunder.

                  (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
         specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted
         by the Issuing Lender or any Lender, under or in connection with any
         Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in
         the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, shall
         not put such Issuing Lender or such Lender under any resulting
         liability to the Credit Parties. It is the intention of the parties
         that this Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and
         indemnify the Issuing Lender and each Lender against any and all risks
         involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks
         are hereby assumed by the Credit Parties, including, without
         limitation, any and all risks of the acts or omissions, whether
         rightful or wrongful, of any Government Authority. The Issuing Lender
         and the Lenders shall not, in any way, be liable for any failure by the
         Issuing Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any Letter of
         Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other cause beyond the
         control of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders.

                  (d) Nothing in this Section is intended to limit the
         Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower contained in Section 2.3(d)
         hereof. The obligations of the Credit Parties under this Section shall
         survive the termination of this Agreement. No act or omissions of any
         current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way
         affect or impair the rights of the Issuing Lender and the Lenders to
         enforce any right, power or benefit under this Agreement.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
         Section, the Credit Parties shall have no obligation to indemnify the
         Issuing Lender or any Lender in respect of any liability incurred by
         the Issuing Lender or such Lender arising out of the gross negligence,
         bad faith or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender (including action
         not taken by the Issuing Lender or such Lender), as determined by a
         court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to arbitration.

         Section 2.18      Illegality.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if any
Change in Law shall make it unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office
to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement or
to obtain in the interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office
the funds with which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such
Lender hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such
shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall give notice
that the condition or situation which gave rise to the suspension shall no
longer exist, and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans,
if any, shall be converted on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans
or within such earlier period as required by law as Alternate Base Rate Loans.
The Borrower hereby agrees to promptly pay any Lender, upon its demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct
costs (but not including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender
in making any repayment in accordance with this Section including, but not
limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder. A
certificate (which certificate shall include a description of the basis for the
computation) as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending
Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be payable
pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause
the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory
burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material.

         Section 2.19      Replacement of Lenders.

                  (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender
         requests compensation under Section 2.14, or requires the Borrower to
         pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority
         for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
         Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
         office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
         rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
         affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
         assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
         Section 2.14 or Section 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and
         (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense
         and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
         hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any
         Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

                  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests
         compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay
         any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for
         the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender
         defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower
         may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
         Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
         without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
         contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.6), all of its
         interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related
         Credit Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
         (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
         assignment), provided that:

                           (i) the Borrower shall have paid to the
                  Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section
                  9.6;

                           (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
                  amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
                  participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon,
                  accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and
                  under the other Credit Documents (including any amounts under
                  Section 2.15) from the assignee (to the extent of such
                  outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
                  Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

                           (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting
                  from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments
                  required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment
                  will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
                  thereafter; and

                           (iv) such assignment does not conflict with
                  applicable law.

         A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the

                           unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end
                           adjustments) and results of operations for the period
                           covered thereby; and

                           liabilities, direct or contingent, of the Borrower
                           and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof,
                           including liabilities for taxes, material commitments
                           and contingent obligations.

                  (b) The five-year projections of the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries delivered to the Lenders on or prior to the Closing Date
         have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions.

         Section 3.2       No Material Adverse Effect; Internal Control Event.

         Since December 31, 2006 (a) (and, in addition, after delivery of annual
audited financial statements in accordance with Section 5.1(a), from the date of
the most recently delivered annual audited financial statements), there has been
no development or event which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (b) no Internal Control Event has occurred.

         Section 3.3       Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law.

         Each of the Credit Parties (a) is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
organization or formation, (b) has the requisite power and authority and the
legal right to own and operate all its property, to lease the property it
operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged
and has taken all actions necessary to maintain all rights, privileges, licenses
and franchises necessary or required in the normal conduct of its business, (c)
is duly qualified to conduct business and in good standing under the laws of (i)
the jurisdiction of its organization or formation, (ii) the jurisdiction where
its chief executive office is located and (iii) each other jurisdiction where
its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification except to the extent that the failure to so qualify
or be in good standing in any such other jurisdiction could not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business or operations of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries in such
jurisdiction and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law,
organizational documents, government permits and government licenses (including
liquor licenses) except to the extent such non-compliance could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The jurisdictions in which the Credit Parties are organized and
qualified to do business as of the Closing Date are described on Schedule 3.3.
The Borrower shall update Schedule 3.3 from time to time, in accordance with
Section 5.2, to add Additional Credit Parties.

         Section 3.4   Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.

                  (a) Each of the Credit Parties has full power and authority
         and the legal right to make, deliver and perform the Credit Documents
         to which it is party and has taken all necessary limited liability
         company, partnership or corporate action to authorize the execution,
         delivery and performance by it of the Credit Documents to which it is
         party. Each Credit Document to which it is a party has been duly
         executed and delivered on behalf of each Credit Party. Each Credit
         Document to which it is a party constitutes a legal, valid and binding
         obligation of each Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party
         in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited
         by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
         similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
         and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by
         proceedings in equity or at law).

                  (b) Each of the Borrower and the Guarantors has obtained (i)
         all material licenses (including material liquor licenses), permits and
         consents necessary or appropriate for such party to conduct the
         business and operations located at each of the Facilities and (ii)
         except for the Pledge Approval, the Colorado Gaming Notice and any
         Approvals of the Gaming Authorities or any other Governmental
         Authorities that the Administrative Agent or any Lender, Secured Party
         or Participant is required to obtain under the Gaming Laws or other
         Requirements of Law in order to exercise their respective rights and
         remedies under the Credit Documents, all required approvals from the
         Gaming Authorities of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
         other Credit Documents.

         Section 3.5       No Legal Bar; No Default.

         The execution, delivery and performance by each Credit Party of the
Credit Documents to which such Credit Party is a party, the borrowings
thereunder and the use of the proceeds of the Loans (a) will not violate any
Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Credit Party (except
those as to which waivers or consents have been obtained), (b) will not conflict
with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the articles of
incorporation, bylaws, articles of organization, operating agreement or other
organization documents of the Credit Parties or any material agreement or other
material instrument to which such Person is a party or by which any of its
properties may be bound or any material approval or material consent from any
Governmental Authority relating to such Person, and (c) will not result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any Credit Party's properties
or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation other
than the Liens arising under or contemplated in connection with the Credit
Documents or Permitted Liens. No Credit Party is in default under or with
respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any material respect. No
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         Section 3.6       No Material Litigation.

         No litigation, investigation, claim, criminal prosecution, civil
investigative demand, imposition of criminal or civil fines and penalties, or
any other proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is
pending or, to the best knowledge of the Credit Parties, threatened by or
against any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or
their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to the Credit Documents
or any Extension of Credit or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(b) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
permanent injunction, temporary restraining order or similar decree has been
issued against any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.7       Investment Company Act; etc.

         No Credit Party is an "investment company", or a company "controlled"
by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. No Credit Party is a subject to regulation under the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, or any federal or state statute or
regulation limiting its ability to incur the Credit Party Obligations.

         Section 3.8       Margin Regulations.

         No part of the proceeds of any Extension of Credit hereunder will be
used directly or indirectly for any purpose that violates, or that would require
any Lender to make any filings in accordance with, the provisions of Regulation
T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as now and
from time to time hereafter in effect. The Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries
(a) are not engaged, principally or as one of their important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying"
"margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of such terms under
Regulation U and (b) taken as a group do not own "margin stock" except as
identified in the financial statements referred to in Section 3.1 or delivered
pursuant to Section 5.1 and the aggregate value of all "margin stock" owned by
the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries taken as a group does not exceed 25%
of the value of their assets.

         Section 3.9       ERISA.

         Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has
occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred resulting in
any liability that has remained underfunded, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or
a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all
accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions
used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to
the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value
of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits. Neither any
Credit Party nor any Commonly Controlled Entity is currently subject to any
liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan.

         Section 3.10      Environmental Matters.

         Except as could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect:

                  (a) The facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by
         the Credit Parties or any of their Subsidiaries (the "Properties") do
         not contain any Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or
         concentrations which (i) constitute a violation of, or (ii) could give
         rise to liability on behalf of any Credit Party under, any
         Environmental Law.

                  (b) The Properties and all operations of the Credit Parties
         and/or their Subsidiaries at the Properties are in compliance, and have
         in the last five years been in compliance, with all applicable
         Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about
         the Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to
         the Properties or the business operated by the Credit Parties or any of
         their Subsidiaries (the "Business").

                  (c) Neither the Credit Parties nor their Subsidiaries have
         received any written or actual notice of violation, alleged violation,
         non-compliance, liability or potential liability on behalf of any
         Credit Party with respect to environmental matters or Environmental
         Laws regarding any of the Properties or the Business, nor do the Credit
         Parties or their Subsidiaries have knowledge or reason to believe that
         any such notice will be received or is being threatened.

                  (d) The Credit Parties have not and, to the best knowledge of
         the Credit Parties, no other Person has disposed of Materials of
         Environmental Concern from the Properties in violation of, or in a
         manner or to a location that could give rise to liability on behalf of
         any Credit Party under any Environmental Law, and the Credit Parties
         have not and, to the best knowledge of the Credit Parties, no other
         Person has generated, treated, stored or disposed of Materials of
         Environmental Concern at, on or under any of the Properties in
         violation of, or in a manner that could give rise to liability on
         behalf of any Credit Party under, any applicable Environmental Law.

                  (e) No judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative
         action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Credit Parties and their
         Subsidiaries, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which any
         Credit Party or any Subsidiary is or will be named as a party with
         respect to the Properties or the Business, nor are there any consent
         decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or
         other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements
         outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties
         or the Business.

                  (f) There has been no release or threat of release of
         Materials of Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or
         arising from or related to the operations of any Credit Party or any
         Subsidiary in connection with the Properties or otherwise in connection
         with the Business, in violation of or in amounts or in a manner that
         could give rise to liability on behalf of any Credit Party under
         Environmental Laws.

         Section 3.11      Use of Proceeds.

         The proceeds of the Extensions of Credit shall be used by the Borrower
solely (a) to refinance certain existing Indebtedness of the Credit Parties and
their Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, the redemption of the Senior
Notes and the payment of any applicable call premium, (b) to pay any costs, fees
and expenses associated with this Agreement on the Closing Date, and (c) for
working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Credit Parties and
their Subsidiaries.

         Section 3.12      Subsidiaries; Joint Ventures; Partnerships.

         Set forth on Schedule 3.12 is a complete and accurate list of all
Subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships of the Credit Parties as of the
Closing Date. Information on the attached Schedule includes the following: (a)
the number of shares of each class of Equity Interest or other equity interests
of each Subsidiary outstanding; and (b) the number and percentage of outstanding
shares of each class of Equity Interest owned by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. The outstanding Equity Interest and other equity interests of all
such Subsidiaries is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is owned
free and clear of all Liens (other than those arising under or contemplated in
connection with the Credit Documents). There are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, rights or other agreements or commitments (other than
stock options granted to employees or directors and directors' qualifying
shares) of any nature relating to any Equity Interest of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, except as contemplated in connection with the Credit Documents. The
Borrower shall update Schedule 3.12 from time to time, in accordance with
Section 5.2, by providing a replacement Schedule 3.12 to the Administrative
Agent.

         Section 3.13      Ownership.

         Each of the Credit Parties and its Subsidiaries is the owner of, and
has good and marketable title to or a valid leasehold interest in, all of its
respective assets, which, together with assets leased or licensed by the Credit
Parties and their Subsidiaries, represents all assets in the aggregate material
to the conduct of the business of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries, and
(after giving effect to the Transactions) none of such assets is subject to any
Lien other than Permitted Liens. Each Credit Party and its Subsidiaries enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all of its leases and all such leases

         percentage would be unlawful or would cause any materially adverse tax
         consequences to the Borrower or any Guarantor) of the voting Equity
         Interest and 100% of the non-voting Equity Interest of its first-tier

rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.

         Section 8.2       Nature of Duties.

         Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the

         The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and
exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit Document by

Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such

except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

                  (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied
         duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

                  (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action
         or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
         powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Credit Documents
         that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in
         writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
         the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other
         Credit Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be
         required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its
         counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
         contrary to any Credit Document or applicable law; and

                  (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the
         other Credit Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
         liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the
         Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained
         by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its
         Affiliates in any capacity.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as
the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under
the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.1 and 7.2) or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty
to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made
in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Credit
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction
of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

         Section 8.4       Reliance by Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by
it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the
proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to
it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper
Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining
compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction
of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that
such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Lender unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender
or the Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such
Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         Section 8.5       Notice of Default.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders except to the extent that
this Agreement expressly requires that such action be taken, or not taken, only
with the consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders, or all of
the Lenders, as the case may be.

         Section 8.6   Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.

         Each Lender and the Issuing Lender expressly acknowledges that neither
the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it
and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of any Credit Party, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each
Lender and the Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of
their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Credit Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

         Section 8.7       Indemnification.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Lender, and the Swingline Lender in its capacity hereunder and their Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, agents and employees (to the extent
not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Commitment Percentages
in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section,
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any
time following the payment of the Credit Party Obligations) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against any such indemnitee in any way relating to or
arising out of any Credit Document or any documents contemplated by or referred
to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by any such indemnitee under or in connection with any
of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the
payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the
extent resulting from such indemnitee's gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The agreements
in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of
the Notes, any Reimbursement Obligation and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         Section 8.8       Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.

         The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term
"Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the
context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative
Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any
other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were
not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor
to the Lenders.

         Section 8.9       Successor Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation
to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such
notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after
the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set
forth above provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower
and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then
such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such
notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (except
that in the case of any Collateral held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Lenders or the Issuing Lender under any of the Credit Documents, the
retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such Collateral until such
time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing
Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the
acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already
discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by
the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those
payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and
under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.5
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent,
its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative
Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

         Section 8.10      Collateral and Guaranty Matters.

                  (a) The Lenders irrevocably authorize and direct the
Administrative Agent:

                           (i) to release any Lien on any Collateral granted to
                  or held by the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document
                  (i) upon termination of the Revolving Commitments and payment
                  in full of all Credit Party Obligations (other than contingent
                  indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made
                  or cannot be reasonably identified by an Indemnitee based on
                  the then-known facts and circumstances) and the expiration or
                  termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii) that is transferred
                  or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any sale
                  or other disposition permitted under Section 6.4, or (iii)
                  subject to Section 9.1, if approved, authorized or ratified in
                  writing by the Required Lenders;

                           (ii) to subordinate any Lien on any Collateral
                  granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any
                  Credit Document to the holder of any Lien on such Collateral
                  that is permitted by Section 6.2; and

                           (iii) to release any Guarantor from its obligations
                  under the applicable Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a
                  Guarantor as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder.

                  (b) In connection with a termination or release pursuant to
         this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and
         deliver to the applicable Credit Party, at the Borrower's expense, all
         documents that the applicable Credit Party shall reasonably request to
         evidence such termination or release. Upon request by the
         Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in
         writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release or subordinate
         its interest in particular types or items of Collateral, or to release
         any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this
         Section.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.1       Amendments, Waivers and Release of Collateral.

         Neither this Agreement nor any of the other Credit Documents, nor any
terms hereof or thereof may be amended, modified, extended, restated, replaced,
or supplemented (by amendment, waiver, consent or otherwise) except in
accordance with the provisions of this Section nor may Collateral be released
except as specifically provided herein or in the Security Documents or in
accordance with the provisions of this Section. The Required Lenders may or,
with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may,
from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written amendments,
supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents
or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Borrower hereunder
or thereunder or (b) waive or consent to the departure from, on such terms and
conditions as the Required Lenders may specify in such instrument, any of the
requirements of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any Default or
Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such
amendment, supplement, modification, release, waiver or consent shall:

                           (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of
                  maturity of any Loan or Note or any installment thereon, or
                  reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable
                  hereunder (except in connection with a waiver of interest at
                  the increased post-default rate set forth in Section 2.8 which
                  shall be determined by a vote of the Required Lenders) or
                  extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase
                  the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's
                  Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each
                  Lender directly affected thereby; provided that, it is
                  understood and agreed that (A) no waiver, reduction or
                  deferral of a mandatory prepayment required pursuant to
                  Section 2.7(b), nor any amendment of Section 2.7(b) or the
                  definitions of Asset Disposition, Debt Issuance, Equity
                  Issuance, Excess Cash Flow or Extraordinary Receipt, shall
                  constitute a reduction of the amount of, or an extension of
                  the scheduled date of, the scheduled date of maturity of, or
                  any installment of, any Loan or Note, (B) any reduction in the
                  stated rate of interest on Revolving Loans shall only require
                  the written consent of each Lender holding a Revolving
                  Commitment, (C) any reduction in the stated rate of interest
                  on the Term Loan shall only require the written consent of
                  each Lender holding a portion of the outstanding Term Loan and
                  (D) any amendment, waiver or modification to Section 2.7 (and
                  any related definitions) shall require the written consent of
                  each Lender adversely affected thereby; or

                           (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this
                  Section or reduce the percentage specified in the definition
                  of Required Lenders, without the written consent of all the
                  Lenders; or

                           (iii) release the Borrower or all or substantially
                  all of the Guarantors from obligations under the Guaranty,
                  without the written consent of all of the Lenders and Hedging
                  Agreement Providers; or

                           (iv) release all or substantially all of the
                  Collateral without the written consent of all of the Lenders
                  and Hedging Agreement Providers; or

                           (v) subordinate the Loans to any other Indebtedness
                  without the written consent of all of the Lenders; or

                           (vi) permit a Letter of Credit to have an original
                  expiry date more than twelve (12) months from the date of
                  issuance without the consent of each of the Revolving Lenders;
                  provided, that the expiry date of any Letter of Credit may be
                  extended in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3(a); or

                           (vii) permit the Borrower to assign or transfer any
                  of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or other
                  Credit Documents without the written consent of all of the
                  Lenders; or

                           (viii) amend, modify or waive any provision of the
                  Credit Documents requiring consent, approval or request of the
                  Required Lenders or all Lenders without the written consent of
                  the Required Lenders or all the Lenders as appropriate; or

                           (ix) without the consent of Required Revolving
                  Lenders, amend, modify or waive any provision in Section 4.2
                  or waive any Default or Event of Default (or amend any Credit
                  Document to effectively waive any Default or Event of Default)
                  if the effect of such amendment, modification or waiver is
                  that the Revolving Lenders shall be required to fund Revolving
                  Loans when such Lenders would otherwise not be required to do
                  so; or

                           (x) amend, modify or waive the order in which Credit
                  Party Obligations are paid or in a manner that would alter the
                  pro rata sharing of payments by and among the Lenders in
                  Section 2.11(b) without the written consent of each Lender and
                  each Hedging Agreement Provider directly affected thereby; or

                           (xi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article
                  VIII without the written consent of the then Administrative
                  Agent; or

                           (xii) amend or modify the definition of Credit Party
                  Obligations to delete or exclude any obligation or liability
                  described therein without the written consent of each Lender
                  and each Hedging Agreement directly affected thereby; or

                           (xiii) permit Interest Periods with a duration longer
                  than six (6) months without the consent of each Lender
                  directly affected thereby; or

                           (xiv) amend or modify the definition of Required
                  Revolving Lenders or Required Term Loan Lenders without the
                  written consent of all the Lenders; or

                           (xv) amend the definitions of "Hedging Agreement,"
                  "Secured Hedging Agreement," or "Hedging Agreement Provider"
                  without the consent of any Hedging Agreement Provider that
                  would be adversely affected thereby;

provided, further, that no amendment, waiver or consent affecting the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender
under any Credit Document shall in any event be effective, unless in writing and
signed by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and/or the Swingline
Lender, as applicable, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take
such action.

         Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and any
such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the
Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event
of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or
impair any right consequent thereon.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment, waiver or other
modification to the financial covenant set forth in Section 5.9 or any component
definition of such financial covenants shall only require the consent of the
Required Revolving Lenders; provided that any amendment, waiver or other
modification to a component definition of the financial covenants in Section 5.9
shall only apply to the computation of such financial covenants.


         Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent of
the Borrower and the other Credit Parties shall not be required for any
amendment, modification or waiver of the provisions of Article VIII (other than
the provisions of Section 8.9).

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (a) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (b) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a
Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

         For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Section 9.1, this Agreement may be amended (or
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Credit Parties and the
Required Lenders (a) to increase the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders
(provided that no Lender shall be required to increase its commitment without
its consent), (b) to add one or more additional borrowing Tranches to this
Agreement and to provide for the ratable sharing of the benefits of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents with the other then outstanding Credit
Party Obligations in respect of the extensions of credit from time to time
outstanding under such additional borrowing Tranche(s) and the accrued interest
and fees in respect thereof and (c) to include appropriately the lenders under
such additional borrowing Tranches in any determination of the Required Lenders
and/or to provide consent rights to such lenders under subsections (ix) and/or
(x) of Section 9.1 corresponding to the consent rights of the other Lenders
thereunder.

         acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication
         is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such

         opening of business on the next business day for the recipient, and

Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial

or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are

         demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit),

         based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third
         party or by the Borrower or any other Credit Party, and regardless of
         whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity
         shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
         losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (A) are
         determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
         nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad
         faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (B) result from a
         claim brought by the Borrower or any other Credit Party against an
         Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee's obligations
         hereunder or under any other Credit Document, if the Borrower or such
         Credit Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its
         favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

         Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Lender,
         Swingline Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each
         Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such
         sub-agent), the Issuing Lender, Swingline Lender or such Related Party,
         as the case may be, such Lender's Commitment Percentage (determined as
         of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
         payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the
         unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or
         related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
         against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Issuing
         Lender or Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any
         Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative
         Agent (or any such sub-agent), Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender in
         connection with such capacity.

                  (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest
         extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and
         hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
         liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
         opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection
         with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Credit Document or
         any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions
         contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use
         of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (b)
         above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by
         unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed
         by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information
         transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other
         Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the
         parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted
         hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this
         Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related

         shall be subject to the following conditions:

                           (i)      Minimum Amounts.

                           Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
                           outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning
                           Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as
                           of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
                           respect to such assignment is delivered to the
                           Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified
                           in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
                           Date) shall not be less than $1,000,000, in the case
                           of any assignment in respect of a revolving facility,
                           or $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in

                           consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
                           shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has
                           occurred and is continuing at the time of such
                           assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an
                           Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and

                           delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect
                           of (i) a Revolving Commitment if such assignment is
                           to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in
                           respect of such facility, an Affiliate of such Lender
                           or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or
                           (ii) a Term Loan Commitment to a Person who is not a
                           Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.

                           (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each

                  Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing
                  and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived in the
                  discretion of the Administrative Agent), and the assignee, if
                  it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
                  an Administrative Questionnaire.

                           (v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment
                  shall be made to the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
                  Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

                           (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such
                  assignment shall be made to a natural person.

                  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from
         and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
         Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement
         and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
         Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of
         the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released
         from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
         Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
         party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
         Sections 2.14 and 9.5 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring
         prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or
         transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
         does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of
         this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
         rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this
         Section.

                  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
         purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
         offices in Charlotte, North Carolina a copy of each Assignment and
         Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
         names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and
         principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
         terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the
         Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative
         Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
         the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
         purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
         Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any
         Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
         prior notice.

                  (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the
         consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
         sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the
         Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
         "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or
         obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
         Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such
         Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
         such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
         for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders, Issuing Lender and Swingline
         Lender shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
         Agreement.

                  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
         such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
         sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
         modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
         that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
         not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
         modification or waiver that affects such Participant. Subject to
         paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14 and 2.15
         to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
         by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent
         permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
         benefits of Section 9.7 as though it were a Lender, provided such
         Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a
         Lender.

                  (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall
         not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.14 and
         2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive
         with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
         sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
         Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign
         Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
         Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold
         to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
         Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or
         assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under
         this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
         pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
         provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender
         from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
         assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

         Section 9.7       Right of Set-off; Sharing of Payments.

                  (a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing, each Lender, the Issuing Lender, and each of their
         respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
         time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and
         apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
         provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other
         obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender,
         the Issuing Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the
         account of the Borrower or any other Credit Party against any and all
         of the obligations of the Borrower or such Credit Party now or
         hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Credit Document to
         such Lender or the Issuing Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
         Lender or the Issuing Lender shall have made any demand under this
         Agreement or any other Credit Document and although such obligations of
         the Borrower or such Credit Party may be contingent or unmatured or are
         owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the Issuing Lender
         different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated
         on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the Issuing Lender and
         their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other
         rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such
         Lender, the Issuing Lender or their respective Affiliates may have.
         Each Lender and the Issuing Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and
         the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and
         application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
         affect the validity of such setoff and application.

                  (b) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
         counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal
         of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder
         resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the
         aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other
         such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided
         herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i)
         notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii) purchase (for
         cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other
         obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as
         shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be
         shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
         of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and
         other amounts owing them, provided that:

                           (i) if any such participations are purchased and all
                  or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
                  recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
                  purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,
                  without interest; and

                           (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
                  construed to apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower
                  pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
                  Agreement or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as
                  consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation
                  in any of its Loans or participations in Letters of Credit to
                  any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any
                  Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this
                  paragraph shall apply).

                  (c) Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
         the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
         Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements
         may exercise against each Credit Party rights of setoff and
         counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such
         Lender were a direct creditor of each Credit Party in the amount of
         such participation.

         Section 9.8       Table of Contents and Section Headings.

         The table of contents and the Section and subsection headings herein
         are intended for convenience only and shall be ignored in construing
         this Agreement.

         Section 9.9  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic
                      Execution.

                  (a) Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
         may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in
         different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original,
         but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
         contract. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and any
         separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
         Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties
         relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all
         previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
         the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.1, this
         Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by
         the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have
         received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the
         signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
         counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or email
         shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
         this Agreement.

                  (b) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words
         "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in any
         Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic
         signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which
         shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
         manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping
         system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any
         applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global
         and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and
         Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform
         Electronic Transactions Act.

         Section 9.10      Severability.

         Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

         Section 9.11      Integration.

         This Agreement and the other Credit Documents represent the agreement
of the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent, the
Borrower, the other Credit Parties, or any Lender relative to the subject matter
hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein.

         Section 9.12      Governing Law.

         This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the law of the State of New York.

         Section 9.13    Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process and Venue.

                  (a) Consent to Jurisdiction. The Borrower and each other
         Credit Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
         its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
         State of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
         action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
         any other Credit Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any
         judgment, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
         unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
         proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York sitting State
         court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such
         Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
         in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
         enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
         manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other
         Credit Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent,
         any Lender or the Issuing Lender may otherwise have to bring any action
         or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document
         against the Borrower or any other Credit Party or its properties in the
         courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (b) Service of Process. Each party hereto irrevocably consents
         to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
         9.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
         hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
         law.

                  (c) Venue. The Borrower and each other Credit Party
         irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted
         by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
         the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or
         relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document in any court
         referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties
         hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
         applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
         of such action or proceeding in any such court.

         Section 9.14      Confidentiality.

         Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and

Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction
over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National

applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder, under any other Credit Document or Secured Hedging Agreement or any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, any other Credit Document or
Secured Hedging Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, (g) (i) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to
any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations,
(ii) an investor or prospective investor in securities issued by an Approved
Fund that also agrees that Information shall be used solely for the purpose of
evaluating an investment in such securities issued by the Approved Fund, (iii) a
trustee, collateral manager, servicer, backup servicer, noteholder or secured
party in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the
assets serving as collateral for securities issued by an Approved Fund, (iv) a
nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information
regarding the Credit Parties, the Loans and Credit Documents in connection with
ratings issued in respect of securities issued by an Approved Fund (in each
case, it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will
be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed to
keep such information confidential) or (v) financing, funding or investing
sources of existing or potential Lenders, assignees or Participants, subject to
an agreement containing substantially the same as those of this Section, (h)
with the consent of the Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (x)
becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or
(y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing
Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than the Borrower.

         For purposes of this Section, "Information" shall mean all information
received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
the Issuing Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that, in the case of information
received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof,
such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided
in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do
so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

         hand, and the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, on the other hand,
         in connection herewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

         of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents to be provided

         changes to or require the termination of any of the Credit Documents,
         including, but not limited to, if a Lender, the Administrative Agent,
         the Arranger, any Secured Party, any Participant or other person having

         this Agreement and the other Credit Documents relative to the

         liquor licenses, may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise
         thereof does not violate any Gaming Law and that any required Approvals
         (including prior Approvals) are obtained from the applicable Gaming
         Authorities; (iii) each shall cooperate with the Gaming Authorities in
         connection with the administration of their regulatory jurisdiction,
         including, without limitation, providing documents or information as
         may be requested by the Gaming Authorities relating to each of them;

         are subject to being called forward by the Gaming Authorities, in their
         discretion, for licensing or finding of suitability or to file or

         of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

(b) authorizes and appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent in accordance
with the terms of Article VIII, (c) authorizes the Administrative Agent to

                                    ARTICLE X

                                    GUARANTY

         Section 10.1      The Guaranty.

         In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and any
Hedging Agreement Provider to enter into any Secured Hedging Agreement and to
extend credit hereunder and thereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits
to be received by the Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder and any
Secured Hedging Agreement, each of the Guarantors hereby agrees with the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Hedging Agreement Providers as
follows: each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and
severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and
prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of
any and all Credit Party Obligations. If any or all of the indebtedness becomes
due and payable hereunder or under any Secured Hedging Agreement, each Guarantor
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders, the Hedging Agreement Providers, or their respective order, or
demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by
the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in collecting any of the Credit Party
Obligations. The Guaranty set forth in this Article X is a guaranty of timely
payment and not of collection. The word "indebtedness" is used in this Article X
in its most comprehensive sense and includes any and all advances, debts,
obligations and liabilities of the Borrower, including specifically all Credit
Party Obligations, arising in connection with this Agreement, the other Credit
Documents or any Secured Hedging Agreement, in each case, heretofore, now, or
hereafter made, incurred or created, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined,
whether or not such indebtedness is from time to time reduced, or extinguished
and thereafter increased or incurred, whether the Borrower may be liable
individually or jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such
indebtedness may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations,
and whether or not such indebtedness may be or hereafter become otherwise
unenforceable.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including,
without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the
Bankruptcy Code).

         Section 10.2      Bankruptcy.

         Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders and any Hedging Agreement Provider
whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence of any
Bankruptcy Event and unconditionally promises to pay such Credit Party
Obligations to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders and to
any such Hedging Agreement Provider, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the
United States. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to the extent that the
Borrower or a Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any
property to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Hedging Agreement
Provider, which payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided,
and/or required to be repaid to the Borrower or a Guarantor, the estate of the
Borrower or a Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the
extent of such avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
said payment had not been made.

         Section 10.3      Nature of Liability.

         The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent
of any security for or other guaranty of the Credit Party Obligations of the
Borrower whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any
other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or
impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by
any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such
other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase,
decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Hedging Agreement Provider on the
Credit Party Obligations which the Administrative Agent, such Lenders or such
Hedging Agreement Provider repay the Borrower pursuant to court order in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief
proceeding, and each of the Guarantors waives any right to the deferral or
modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.

         Section 10.4      Independent Obligation.

         The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of any other Guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not
action is brought against any other Guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not
any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.

         Section 10.5      Authorization.

         Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and each Hedging Agreement Provider without notice or demand (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or
impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise,
extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or
otherwise change the terms of the Credit Party Obligations or any part thereof
in accordance with this Agreement and any Secured Hedging Agreement, as
applicable, including any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon,
(b) take and hold security from any Guarantor or any other party for the payment
of this Guaranty or the Credit Party Obligations and exchange, enforce waive and
release any such security, (c) apply such security and direct the order or
manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their
discretion may determine, (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers,
Guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors and (e) to the extent otherwise
permitted herein, release or substitute any Collateral.

         Section 10.6      Reliance.

         It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any
Hedging Agreement Provider to inquire into the capacity or powers of the
Borrower or the officers, directors, members, partners or agents acting or
purporting to act on its behalf, and any Credit Party Obligations made or
created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be
guaranteed hereunder.

         Section 10.7      Waiver.

                  (a) Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall
         be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the
         Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Hedging Agreement Provider to
         (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other
         party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the
         Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or (iii) pursue any
         other remedy in the Administrative Agent's, any Lender's or any Hedging
         Agreement Provider's power whatsoever. Each of the Guarantors waives
         any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any
         other guarantor or any other party other than payment in full of the
         Credit Party Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations),
         including without limitation any defense based on or arising out of the
         disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or
         the unenforceability of the Credit Party Obligations or any part
         thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
         liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Credit
         Party Obligations. The Administrative Agent may, at its election,
         foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
         by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every
         aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such
         sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or
         remedy the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against the
         Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or
         impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to
         the extent the Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full and the
         Commitments have been terminated. Each of the Guarantors waives any
         defense arising out of any such election by the Administrative Agent or
         any of the Lenders, even though such election operates to impair or
         extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or
         remedy of the Guarantors against the Borrower or any other party or any
         security.

                  (b) Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands
         for performance, protests and notices, including without limitation
         notices of nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor,
         notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence,
         creation or incurring of new or additional Credit Party Obligations.
         Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself
         informed of the Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all
         other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Credit
         Party Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which
         such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither
         the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise
         such Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances
         or risks.

                  (c) Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise
         any rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a
         result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the
         U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders or any
         Hedging Agreement Provider against the Borrower or any other guarantor
         of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower owing to the Lenders or
         such Hedging Agreement Provider (collectively, the "Other Parties") and
         all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement,
         contribution or indemnity from any Other Party which it may at any time
         otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until such time as the
         Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in full and the
         Commitments have been terminated. Each of the Guarantors hereby further
         agrees not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the
         Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any Hedging Agreement Provider now
         have or may hereafter have against any Other Party, any endorser or any
         other guarantor of all or any part of the Credit Party Obligations of
         the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any
         security or collateral given to or for the benefit of the Lenders
         and/or the Hedging Agreement Providers to secure payment of the Credit
         Party Obligations of the Borrower until such time as the Credit Party
         Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations) shall have
         been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.

         Section 10.8      Limitation on Enforcement.

         The Lenders and the Hedging Agreement Providers agree that this
Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting
upon the instructions of the Required Lenders or such Hedging Agreement Provider
(only with respect to obligations under the applicable Secured Hedging
Agreement) and that no Lender or Hedging Agreement Provider shall have any right
individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood
and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders under the terms of this Agreement and for
the benefit of any Hedging Agreement Provider under any Secured Hedging
Agreement. The Lenders and the Hedging Agreement Providers further agree that
this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Guarantors.

         Section 10.9      Confirmation of Payment.

         The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after
payment of the Credit Party Obligations which are the subject of this Guaranty
and termination of the Commitments relating thereto, confirm to the Borrower,
the Guarantors or any other Person that such indebtedness and obligations have
been paid and the Commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the
provisions of Section 10.2.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                       SUBORDINATION OF INTERCOMPANY DEBT

         Section 11.1      Subordination.

                  (a) General. Each of the Credit Parties agrees and covenants
         that the Intercompany Debt is and shall be subordinate in right and
         order of payment to the payment in full of the Credit Party Obligations
         on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

                  (b) Permitted Payments. Upon the occurrence and during the
         continuance of a Default or Event of Default and at the direction of
         the Administrative Agent, no Credit Party shall receive payments of
         interest, principal and other amounts on the Intercompany Debt until
         the Credit Party Obligations are paid in full or until otherwise agreed
         by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders.

         Section 11.2      Priority and Payment of Proceeds in Certain Events.

                  (a) Insolvency or Dissolution of a Credit Party. Upon the
         occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event, all Credit Party Obligations shall
         first be paid in full before any Credit Party shall be entitled to
         receive any payment of the Intercompany Debt, unless otherwise agreed
         to by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders. Upon the
         occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event, any payment or distribution of
         assets of a Credit Party of any kind or character, whether in cash,
         property or securities to which a Credit Party would be entitled,
         except for the provisions of this Article XI, shall be made by such
         Credit Party or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating
         trustee, agent or other person making such payment or distribution,
         directly to the Administrative Agent for application (in the case of
         cash) to or as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or
         securities) for the payment in full of all Credit Party Obligations
         after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the
         Administrative Agent on the Credit Party Obligations.

                  (b) Payments in General. No direct or indirect payment or
         distribution by or on behalf of a Credit Party in respect of the
         Intercompany Debt upon acceleration shall be made, and no other
         consideration in respect of the Intercompany Debt shall be given or
         received to the extent prohibited by Section 11.1(b).

                  (c) Certain Payments Held in Trust. In the event that,
         notwithstanding the foregoing provisions prohibiting such payment or
         distribution or such giving or receipt of consideration, any Credit
         Party shall have received any payment or distribution or consideration
         in respect of the Intercompany Debt contrary to such provisions, then,
         and in such event, such payment or distribution or consideration shall
         be received and held in trust for the Lenders and shall be paid over or
         delivered to the Administrative Agent for application to or as
         collateral for the payment or prepayment of all Credit Party
         Obligations in full after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
         distribution to the Administrative Agent in respect of the Credit Party
         Obligations. No amount paid by any Credit Party to the holder or
         holders of the Intercompany Debt and paid over by the holder or holders
         of the Intercompany Debt to the holders of the Credit Party Obligations
         pursuant to this Article XI shall, as between any Credit Party and the
         holder or holders of the Intercompany Debt, be deemed to be a payment
         by any Credit Party to or on account of such Intercompany Debt.

         Section 11.3      Restrictions on Actions by Credit Parties.

         Until the Credit Party Obligations are paid in full, the Credit Parties
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, take
any Collection Action with respect to the Intercompany Debt.

         Section 11.4      Miscellaneous.

                  (a) The provisions of this Article XI shall continue to be
         effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any
         payment of any of the Credit Party Obligations is rescinded or must
         otherwise be returned by the Lenders or any other recipient thereof, as
         the case may be, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
         any Credit Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been
         made.

                  (b) No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent to
         exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate
         as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
         right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof of the
         exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are
         cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  (c) The provisions of this Article XI constitute a continuing
         agreement and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the
         Credit Documents shall have been terminated and the Credit Party
         Obligations shall have been paid in full, (ii) be binding upon each of
         the Credit Parties and its successors and assigns and (iii) inure to
         the benefit of and be enforceable by the Administrative Agent and its
         respective successors, transferees and assigns.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the terms of this Article XI, the
         Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall have the right to
         waive the subordination terms of this Article XI and require the Credit
         Parties to enforce the obligations under the Intercompany Debt in
         accordance with the terms thereof.

agreements, the "Deposit Agreement").

The Company hereby confirms to the Bank that the Company has granted to the
Secured Party a security interest in the following (collectively, the "Account
Collateral"): (a) the Account(s), (b) the Lockbox(es) and (c) the Items
Collateral. The term "Items Collateral" means, collectively, all checks, drafts,
instruments, cash and other items at any time received in any Lockbox or for
deposit in any Account (subject to specific Lockbox instructions in effect for
processing items), wire transfers of funds, automated clearing house ("ACH")
entries, credits from merchant card transactions and other electronic funds
transfers or other funds deposited in, credited to, or held for deposit in or
credit to, any Account.

The parties desire to enter into this Agreement in order to set forth their
relative rights and duties with respect to the Account Collateral. In
consideration of the mutual covenants herein as well as other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Control of the Accounts

(a) The Statement of Facts is incorporated herein by reference. The Bank
represents that it is a "bank". The Company and the Bank acknowledge that each
Account is a "deposit account". Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that
this Agreement is an "authenticated" record and that the arrangements
established under this Agreement constitute "control" of each Account. Each of
these terms is used in this Agreement as defined in Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code as adopted by the State of [____________] (the "[State] UCC").

(b) The Company represents and warrants to the Secured Party that Exhibit A
contains a complete and accurate list of all Accounts and Lockboxes maintained
by the Company with the Bank and subject to this Agreement. The Company
covenants for the benefit of the Secured Party that the Company shall not open
or maintain any deposit account with the Bank other than the Account(s). Nothing
in this Agreement shall impose upon the Bank any duty to monitor or assure the
Company's compliance with this Section 1(b).

(c) The Bank confirms that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Company and
the Bank have not entered into any agreement (other than the Deposit Agreement)
with any person pursuant to which the Bank is obligated to comply with
instructions from such person as to the disposition of funds in any Account or
of Items Collateral. During the term of this Agreement the Bank will not enter
into any agreement with any person other than the Secured Party pursuant to
which the Bank will be obligated to comply with instructions from such person as
to the disposition of funds in any Account or of Items Collateral.

(d) The Company authorizes and directs the Bank to comply with all instructions
given by the Secured Party in accordance with this Agreement and permissible
under the Deposit Agreement, including directing the disposition of funds in any
Account or as to any other matter relating to any Account or other Account
Collateral, without further consent by the Company.

(e) The Secured Party authorizes and instructs the Bank to (i) permit the
Company to have access to and disposition over the Account(s) and Account
Collateral and to otherwise deal with same as provided in the Deposit Agreement
and (ii) act upon the instructions that the Bank shall receive from the Company
concerning the Lockbox and the Account Collateral until the implementation by
the Bank of the written instruction from the Secured Party to the Bank
substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof
(the "Notice") in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of this Agreement.
The Secured Party's right to give instructions to the Bank regarding any Account
Collateral also shall include (but is not limited to) the right to give "stop
payment orders" to the Bank for any item presented to the Bank against any
Account even if it results in dishonor of the item presented against the
Account.

(f) Until delivery of the Notice by the Secured Party in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7, the Secured Party shall not give any instruction to the
Bank or otherwise exercise control over the Account(s) and the Account
Collateral and, until the Bank shall receive and implement the Notice as
provided in Section 7, the Bank shall not (and shall not be required by the
provisions of this Agreement to) honor and follow any instruction the Bank may
receive from the Secured Party with regard to the Account(s) and the Account
Collateral. Upon the implementation of the Notice by the Bank, the Bank shall
not permit any officer, agent or other representative of the Company or its
affiliates to direct the disposition of funds in any Account, withdraw any
amount from any Account or otherwise exercise any authority or power with
respect to any Lockbox, Account or Account Collateral. Upon implementation of
the Notice by the Bank, all collected and available funds in any Account shall
only be withdrawn or transferred based on instructions given by the Secured
Party in accordance with this Agreement.


(g) Federal Reserve Regulations and Operating Circulars, ACH or other clearing
house rules and other applicable law (including, without limitation, the Uniform
Commercial Code as adopted by the State in which the respective Account
identified on Exhibit A is located (hereinafter, the "Applicable UCC")) and the
Deposit Agreement shall also apply to the Secured Party's exercise of control
over the Account(s) and the Account Collateral and to the performance of
services hereunder by the Bank. Each of the Company and the Secured Party
authorizes and instructs the Bank to supply the Company's or the Secured Party's
endorsement, as appropriate, to any Items Collateral that the Bank shall receive
for deposit to any Account.


2. Statements and Other Information If so requested of the Bank by the Secured
Party in writing, the Bank will send to the Secured Party (in a manner
consistent with the Bank's standard practices) at the Secured Party's address
specified in Section 7, copies of all Account statements and communications (but
not canceled checks) that the Bank is required to send to the Company under the
Deposit Agreement. The Bank also shall provide to each of the Company and the
Secured Party when requested (as a service under this Agreement and/or the
Deposit Agreement) copies of Account statements and other deposit account
information, including Account balances, by telephone and by computer
communication, to the extent practicable when requested by the Company or by the
Secured Party. The Company consents to the Bank's release of such Account
information to the Secured Party. The Bank's liability for its failure to comply
with this Section 2 shall not exceed its cost of providing such information.

3. Setoff; Returned Items and Charges

(a) The Bank will not exercise any security interest (except for the security
interest provided in Section 4-210, "Security Interest of Collecting Bank in
Items, Accompanying Documents and Proceeds", of the Applicable UCC), lien, right
of setoff, deduction, recoupment or banker's lien or any other interest in or
against any Account or any other Account Collateral, and the Bank hereby
subordinates to the Secured Party any such security interest (except for such
security interest provided in such Section 4-210 of the Applicable UCC), lien or
right which the Bank may have against any Account or other Account Collateral.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secured Party and the Company agree
that the Bank at all times (including following commencement of any bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding by or against the Company) may set off and charge
against any Account (regardless of any agreement by the Company to compensate
the Bank by means of balances in the Account) all of the following as permitted
by the Deposit Agreement (collectively, the "Permitted Debits"): (i) the face
amount of each Returned Item (hereinafter defined), (ii) usual and customary
service charges and fees, (iii) account maintenance fees, (iv) transfer fees,
(v) out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys' reasonable fees)
incurred by the Bank (including those in connection with the negotiation,
administration or enforcement of this Agreement), and (vi) adjustments or
corrections of posting or encoding errors; whether any Permitted Debit shall
have accrued or been incurred before or after the date of this Agreement.
"Returned Item" means any (i) Items Collateral deposited into or credited to an
Account before or after the date of this Agreement and returned unpaid or
otherwise uncollected or subject to an adjustment entry, whether for
insufficient funds or any other reason, and without regard to the timeliness of
such return or adjustment or the occurrence or timeliness of any other party's
notice of nonpayment or adjustment; (ii) Items Collateral subject to a claim
against the Bank for breach of transfer, presentment, encoding, retention or
other warranty under Federal Reserve Regulations or Operating Circulars, ACH or
other clearing house rules, or applicable law (including, without limitation,
Articles 3, 4 and 4A of the Applicable UCC); and (iii) demand for chargeback in
connection with a merchant card transaction.

(b) If (i) the Bank were unable to set off or charge any Permitted Debit against
any Account because of insufficient funds in the Account, or (ii) the Bank in
good faith were to believe that any legal process or applicable law prohibited
such setoff or charge against any Account, or (iii) the Account were closed,
then: (A) the Bank may charge such Permitted Debits to and set off same against
any other Account; and (B) if there were insufficient funds in the Account(s)
against which to charge or set off such Permitted Debits, then the Bank shall
demand (unless the Bank shall believe in good faith that any legal process or
applicable law prohibits such demand) that the Company pay, and the Company
shall pay, to the Bank promptly upon the Company's receipt of the Bank's written
demand therefor, the full amount of all unpaid Permitted Debits.

(c) If (i) there were insufficient funds in the Account(s) against which the
Bank could charge or set off Permitted Debits and the Company shall have failed
to pay the Bank the full amount of unpaid Permitted Debits as described in
paragraph (b) of this Section 3, and (ii) the Bank shall have received and
implemented the Notice as provided herein, then the Bank may demand that the
Secured Party pay, and the Secured Party shall pay, to the Bank within five (5)
business days of the Secured Party's receipt of the Bank's written demand
therefor, the full amount of unpaid Permitted Debits; provided, however, as to
unpaid Permitted Debits that are service charges, fees or expenses, the Secured
Party shall be required to pay to the Bank only those service charges, fees or
expenses attributable to any Account that shall have been incurred in connection
with any Account on or after the date of this Agreement and on or before the
date of termination of this Agreement.

4. Exculpation of Bank

(a) At all times the Bank shall be entitled to rely upon any communication it
receives from the Secured Party or the Company in connection with this Agreement
or that the Bank shall believe in good faith to be a communication received from
the Secured Party or the Company in connection with this Agreement, and the Bank
shall have no obligation to investigate or verify the authenticity or
correctness of any such communication. The Bank shall have no liability to the
Company or the Secured Party for (i) honoring or following any instruction the
Bank shall receive from (or shall believe in good faith to be from) the Secured
Party in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) honoring or following any
instruction the Bank shall receive from (or shall believe in good faith to be
from) the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the Deposit Agreement
prior to the implementation of the Notice by the Bank. The Bank shall not be
responsible for the validity, priority or enforceability of the Secured Party's
security interest in any Account Collateral, nor shall the Bank be responsible
for enforcement of any agreement between the Company and the Secured Party.

(b) The Bank shall be responsible only for the actual loss that a court having
jurisdiction over the Account(s) shall have determined had been incurred by the
Company or the Secured Party and had been caused by the Bank's gross negligence
or willful misconduct in its performance of its obligations under this
Agreement. The Bank shall have no liability to any party for failure of, or
delay in, its performance under this Agreement resulting from any "act of God",
war or terrorism, fire, other catastrophe or force majeure, electrical or
computer or telecommunications failure, any event beyond the control of the
Bank, or fraud committed by any third party. Nothing in this Agreement shall
create any agency, fiduciary, joint venture or partnership relationship between
the Bank and the Company or between the Bank and the Secured Party. Except as
shall be specifically required under this Agreement or the Deposit Agreement or
applicable law, the Bank shall have no duty whatsoever to the Company in
connection with the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as shall be
specifically required under this Agreement or applicable law, the Bank shall
have no duty whatsoever to the Secured Party in connection with the subject
matter of this Agreement.

5. Indemnification

(a) The Company hereby indemnifies the Bank and holds it harmless against, and
shall reimburse the Bank for, any loss, damage or expense (including attorneys'
reasonable fees and expenses, court costs and other expenses) including, but not
limited to, (i) unpaid charges, fees, and Returned Items for which the Company
and/or the Secured Party originally received credit or remittance by the Bank,
and (ii) any loss, damage or expense the Bank shall incur as a result of (A)
entering into or acting pursuant to this Agreement, (B) honoring and following
any instruction the Bank may receive from (or shall believe in good faith to be
from) the Secured Party or the Company under this Agreement, and (C) upon
implementation of the Notice, not honoring or following any instruction it shall
receive from (or shall believe in good faith to be from) the Company in
accordance with this Agreement. The Company shall not be responsible for any
loss, damage, or expense that a court having jurisdiction shall have determined
had been caused by the Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in its
performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting in any way the Secured Party's obligation to pay or
reimburse the Bank as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Secured Party
hereby indemnifies the Bank and holds it harmless against any loss, damage or
expense (including attorneys' reasonable fees and expenses, court costs and
other expenses) which the Bank shall incur as a result of honoring or following
any instruction (including the Notice) it shall receive from (or shall believe
in good faith to be from) the Secured Party under this Agreement. The Secured
Party shall not be responsible for any loss, damage, or expense that a court
having jurisdiction shall have determined had been caused by the Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct in its performance of its obligations under
this Agreement.

(c) No party hereto shall be liable to any other party under this Agreement for
lost profits or special, indirect, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages,
even if such party shall have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

6. Third Party Claims; Insolvency of Company

(a) In the event that the Bank shall receive notice that any third party shall
have asserted an adverse claim by legal process against any Account or any sums
on deposit therein, any Lockbox or other Account Collateral, whether such claim
shall have arisen by tax lien, execution of judgment, statutory attachment,
garnishment, levy, claim of a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession,
post-bankruptcy petition lender, court appointed receiver, or other judicial or
regulatory order or process (each, a "Claim"), the Bank may, in addition to
other remedies it possesses under the Deposit Agreement, this Agreement or at
law or in equity: (i) suspend disbursements from such Account without any
liability until the Bank shall have received an appropriate court order or other
assurances reasonably acceptable to the Bank in its sole discretion establishing
that funds may continue to be disbursed according to instructions then
applicable to such Account, and/or (ii) interplead such funds in such Account as
permitted by applicable law. The Bank's costs, expenses and attorneys'
reasonable fees incurred in connection with any such Claim are Permitted Debits
and shall be reimbursed to the Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section
3 above.

(b) If a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding were commenced by or against the
Company, the Bank shall be entitled, without any liability, to refuse to (i)
permit withdrawals or transfers from the Account(s) or (ii) accept or comply
with the Notice thereafter received by the Bank, until the Bank shall have
received an appropriate court order or other assurances reasonably acceptable to
the Bank in its sole discretion establishing that (A) continued withdrawals or
transfers from the Account(s) or honoring or following any instruction from
either the Company or the Secured Party are authorized and shall not violate any
law, regulation, or order of any court and (B) the Bank shall have received
adequate protection for its right to set off against or charge the Account(s) or
otherwise be reimbursed for all Permitted Debits.

7. Notice and Communications

(a) All communications given by any party to another as required or provided
under this Agreement must be in writing, directed to the respective designated
officer ("Designated Officer") set forth under paragraph (c) of this Section 7,
and delivered to each recipient party at its address (or at such other address
and to such other Designated Officer as such party may designate in writing to
the other parties in accordance with this Section 7) either by U.S. Mail,
receipted delivery service or via telecopier facsimile transmission. All
communications given by the Secured Party to the Bank must be addressed and
delivered contemporaneously to both the Bank's Designated Officer and the Bank's
"with copy to" addressee at their respective addresses set forth below.

(b) Any communication (including the Notice) made by (or believed in good faith
by the Bank to be made by) the Company or the Secured Party to the Bank under
this Agreement shall be deemed delivered to the Bank if delivered by: (i) U.S.
Mail, on the date that such communication shall have been delivered to the
Bank's Designated Officer; (ii) receipted delivery service, on the date and time
that such communication shall have been delivered to the Bank's Designated
Officer and receipted by the delivery service; or (iii) telecopier facsimile
transmission, on the date and at the time that such communication shall have
been delivered to the Bank's Designated Officer and receipt of such delivery
shall have been acknowledged by the recipient telecopier equipment.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, any communication
hereunder to the Bank that is an instruction (including the Notice) delivered to
the Bank and made by (or believed by the Bank in good faith to be made by) the
Company or the Secured Party shall be deemed received by the Bank when actually
delivered to the Bank's Designated Officer if delivered before 2:00 PM Eastern
time on a banking day or, if such communication were delivered after 2:00 PM
Eastern time on a banking day or delivered on a day that is not a banking day,
then such communication shall be deemed delivered to the Bank's Designated
Officer at the Bank's opening of its business on the next succeeding banking
day. A "banking day" means any day other than any Saturday or Sunday or other
day on which the Bank is authorized or required by law to close.

(c) The Notice shall be implemented by the Bank by the close of the Bank's
business on the banking day that shall be one (1) banking day after the banking
day on which the Notice was actually received by the Bank's Designated Officer.
Any other instruction delivered to the Bank shall be implemented by the Bank by
the close of the Bank's business on the banking day that shall be two (2)
banking days after the banking day on which such instruction was actually
received by the Bank's Designated Officer.

"Lenders") and the Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings provided in the Credit Agreement.

         The Subsidiary Guarantor is an Additional Credit Party, and,
consequently, the Credit Parties are required by Section 5.10 of the Credit
Agreement to cause the Subsidiary Guarantor to become a "Guarantor" thereunder.

         Accordingly, the Subsidiary Guarantor and the Borrower hereby agree as
follows with the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders:

         1. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges, agrees and confirms
that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantor will be
deemed to be a party to and a "Guarantor" under the Credit Agreement and shall
have all of the obligations of a Guarantor thereunder as if it had executed the

hereof, and agrees to be bound by, all of the terms, provisions and conditions
contained in the applicable Credit Documents, including without limitation (a)
all of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III of the Credit
Agreement and (b) all of the affirmative and negative covenants set forth in
Articles V and VI of the Credit Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing terms of this Paragraph 1, the Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
guarantees, jointly and severally together with the other Guarantors, the prompt
payment of the Credit Party Obligations in accordance with Article X of the
Credit Agreement.

         2. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges, agrees and confirms
that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantor will be
deemed to be a party to the Security Agreement, and shall have all the rights
and obligations of an "Obligor" (as such term is defined in the Security
Agreement) thereunder as if it had executed the Security Agreement. The
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby ratifies, as of the date hereof, and agrees to be
bound by, all of the terms, provisions and conditions contained in the Security
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing terms of this
Paragraph 2, the Subsidiary Guarantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Lenders, a continuing security interest in, and a right
of set off, to the extent applicable, against any and all right, title and
interest of the Subsidiary Guarantor in and to the Collateral (as such term is
defined in Section 2 of the Security Agreement) of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

         3. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges, agrees and confirms
that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantor will be
deemed to be a party to the Credit Party Pledge Agreement, and shall have all
the rights and obligations of a "Pledgor" thereunder as if it had executed the
Credit Party Pledge Agreement. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby ratifies, as of
the date hereof, and agrees to be bound by, all the terms, provisions and
conditions contained in the Credit Party Pledge Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing terms of this Paragraph 3, the Subsidiary Guarantor
hereby pledges and assigns to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders, and grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders,
a continuing security interest in any and all right, title and interest of the
Subsidiary Guarantor in and to Pledged Capital Stock (as such term is defined in
Section 2 of the Credit Party Pledge Agreement) and the other Pledged Collateral
(as such term is defined in Section 2 of the Credit Party Pledge Agreement).

         4. The Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that it has
received a copy of the Credit Agreement and the schedules and exhibits thereto
and each Security Document and the schedules and exhibits thereto. The
information on the schedules to the Credit Agreement and the Security Documents
are hereby supplemented (to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement or
Security Documents) to reflect the information shown on the attached Schedule A.

         5. The Borrower confirms that the Credit Agreement is, and upon the
Subsidiary Guarantor becoming a Guarantor, shall continue to be, in full force
and effect. The parties hereto confirm and agree that immediately upon the
Subsidiary Guarantor becoming a Guarantor the term "Credit Party Obligations,"
as used in the Credit Agreement, shall include all obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Credit Agreement and under each other Credit Document.

         6. Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that at any
time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Administrative
Agent, it will execute and deliver such further documents and do such further
acts as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement in order to effect the purposes of
this Agreement.

         7. This Agreement (a) may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall
constitute one contract and (b) may, upon execution, be delivered by facsimile
or electronic mail, which shall be deemed for all purposes to be an original
signature.

         8. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The terms of Sections 9.13
and 9.16 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by reference, mutatis

         WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of June 8,

to time, the "Credit Agreement"), the Lenders have agreed to make loans and to
issue and/or acquire participation interests in letters of credit upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

         WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated as of June
8, 2007 (as amended, modified, extended, restated, replaced, or supplemented
from time to time, the "Security Agreement"), among the Borrower, the Guarantors
and the Administrative Agent, the Pledgor has granted a security interest to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in all of its
right, title, interest and control in, to and over that certain securities
account number [_____________] maintained by the Pledgor with the Intermediary
and all Financial Assets contained in such account (collectively, the
"Account"), as well as all documents executed and delivered in connection
therewith, to secure its obligations under the Credit Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, the parties hereto are entering into this Agreement to provide
the Administrative Agent with Control (as defined in the UCC referred to below)
of the Account and to perfect the security interests of the Administrative Agent
in the Account.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

                                A G R E E M E N T

         1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. Further, the
following capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Uniform Commercial Code of the State of [New York] as in effect from time to
time (the "UCC"): Control, Entitlement Order and Financial Asset.

         2. Account. The Intermediary hereby represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent that (a) the Account has been established in the name of
the Pledgor as recited above, (b) subject to the terms of Section 4 below, the
Pledgor is entitled to control of the Account and to direct the Intermediary in
the management and distribution of the contents thereof and (c) except for the
claims and interest of the Administrative Agent and the Pledgor in the Account,
the Intermediary does not know of any claim to or interest in the Account. All
parties hereto agree that all property held by the Intermediary in the Account
will be treated as Financial Assets under Article 8 of the UCC.

         3. Priority of Lien. The Intermediary hereby acknowledges the security
interests granted to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders,
by the Pledgor in the Account. The Intermediary hereby subordinates all liens,
encumbrances, claims and rights of setoff it may have against the Account or any
Financial Asset carried in the Account or any funds in the Account and agrees
that it will not enforce any lien, encumbrance, claim or right against the
Account or any funds or Financial Assets carried in the Account until this
Agreement has been terminated as provided herein; provided, however, that the
Intermediary may set off all reasonable amounts due and payable to the
Intermediary in respect of its ordinary course of business account fees
(including, without limitation, its ordinary transaction fees) and expenses for
the maintenance and operation of the Account. Without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent and the Pledgor, the Intermediary will not execute
and deliver, or otherwise become bound by, any agreement (i.e., a control
agreement) under which the Intermediary agrees with any third party that the
Intermediary will comply with any directions to transfer or redeem all or any
portion of the Financial Assets or funds in the Account originated by such third
party.

         4. Control. The Intermediary will comply with Entitlement Orders or
instructions originated by the Administrative Agent concerning the Account
without further consent by the Pledgor or any other person (including, without
limitation, any request by the Administrative Agent to pay over to the
Administrative Agent the entire amount and any other Financial Assets in the
Account to the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any objection raised by the
Pledgor). The Pledgor agrees to indemnify the Intermediary and hold the
Intermediary harmless from any claim or liability it may incur by having acted
in accordance with a Notice (as defined below) or instructions given by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to an Entitlement Order, except to the extent that
such claims or liabilities arise from the Intermediary's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Intermediary and the Pledgor agree that, notwithstanding
any agreement, written or otherwise, to the contrary, upon receipt of written
notice by the Intermediary from the Administrative Agent in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (a "Notice") of the occurrence and continuation of an Event
of Default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, (a) the Intermediary shall
neither accept nor comply with any Entitlement Order or instructions from the
Pledgor withdrawing or redeeming any assets from the Account nor deliver any
such assets to the Pledgor nor pay any free funds or other amount owing from the
Intermediary to the Pledgor with respect to the Account without the specific
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and (b) the Intermediary shall
thereafter comply with any Entitlement Order or instructions from the
Administrative Agent directing disposition of the Financial Assets or funds in
the Account without further consent of the Pledgor or any other person. The
Administrative Agent agrees that until the Intermediary receives a Notice, such
Intermediary may comply with any Entitlement Order or instructions from the
Pledgor with respect to the Account without receiving the consent of the
Administrative Agent. Furthermore, the Intermediary agrees to note the
Administrative Agent's security interests in the Account on its books and
records.

         5. Statements, Confirmations and Notices of Adverse Claims. Upon
receipt of written notice of any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim against the
Account or against any Financial Asset or funds carried therein (other than any
lien in favor of the Administrative Agent), the Intermediary will promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Pledgor thereof in writing at the
addresses set forth on Schedule A attached hereto.

         6. Limited Responsibility of the Intermediary. The Intermediary shall
have no responsibility or liability to the Administrative Agent with respect to
the value of the Account or any asset held therein or any responsibility to
limit, restrict or otherwise monitor the withdrawal of assets from the Account
by the Pledgor unless and until a Notice has been received by the Intermediary
in the manner specified herein. The Intermediary shall have no duty to
investigate or make any determination as to whether a default or an event of
default exists under any agreement between the Pledgor and the Administrative
Agent. This Agreement does not create any obligation or duty of the Intermediary
other than those expressly set forth herein. The Intermediary may rely on
notices and communications which do not conflict with the terms hereof that it
reasonably believes are given by the appropriate party.

         7. Conflict. The Account shall be governed by the account agreement
between the Pledgor and the Intermediary. In the event of a conflict between
this Agreement and such account agreement or any other agreement between the
Intermediary and the Pledgor, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.
Regardless of any provision in any such other agreement relating to the law
governing the Account, the parties hereto agree that the establishment and
maintenance of the Account, and all interests, duties and obligations with
respect thereto, shall be governed by the law of the State of [New York].

         8. Termination. The rights and powers granted herein to the
Administrative Agent (a) have been granted in order to perfect the
Administrative Agent's security interests in the Account, (b) are powers coupled
with an interest and (c) will neither be affected by the bankruptcy of the
Pledgor nor by the lapse of time. The obligations of the Intermediary hereunder
shall continue in effect until (i) the Administrative Agent has notified the
Intermediary in writing that this Agreement is to be terminated or (ii) the
Intermediary provides the Administrative Agent with sixty (60) days prior
written notice that this Agreement is to be terminated.

         9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, any schedules or exhibits hereto
and the instructions and notices required or permitted to be executed and
delivered hereunder set forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

         10. Amendments. No amendment, modification or, except as otherwise
specified in Section 8 above, termination of this Agreement, nor any assignment
of any rights hereunder, shall be binding on any party hereto unless it is in
writing and is signed by each of the parties hereto, and any attempt to so
amend, modify, terminate or assign except pursuant to such a writing shall be
null and void. No waiver of any rights hereunder shall be binding on any party
hereto unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party against whom
enforcement is sought.

         11. Severability. If any term or provision set forth in this Agreement
shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, or the
application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances, other than
those to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall be construed in all
respects as if such invalid or unenforceable term or provision were omitted.

         12. Notices. Any notice, request or other communication required or
permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to
have been properly given (a) when delivered, (b) when transmitted via telecopy
(or other facsimile device) to the number set forth on Schedule A hereto, (c)
the Business Day following the day on which the same has been delivered prepaid
(or subject to an invoice arrangement) to a reputable national overnight air
courier service, or (d) the third Business Day following the day on which the
same is sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, in each case to
the respective parties at the address or telecopy numbers set forth on Schedule
A attached hereto, or at such other address as such party may specify by written
notice to the other parties hereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, a legal
holiday or a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law
or other governmental action to close in [New York, New York] [or] [Charlotte,
North Carolina].

         13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed (a) in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when
taken together shall constitute one contract and (b) by facsimile signature,
which shall be deemed for all purposes to be an original signature.

         14. Governing Law. This Agreement, and the rights and obligations of
the parties hereto, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of [New York]. Regardless of any provision in any other
agreement, for purposes of the UCC, [New York] shall be the Intermediary's
jurisdiction for purposes of Section 8-110 of the UCC.

         15. Consent to Jurisdiction. All judicial proceedings brought against
any party hereto with respect to this Agreement may be brought in any state or
federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of [New York], and, by
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto accepts,
for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally,
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably agrees to
be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby in connection with this
Agreement from which no appeal has been taken or is available.

         16. Waiver of Jury Trial and Consequential Damages. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. Each of the parties hereto agrees
not to assert any claim against any other party to this Agreement or any their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, Affiliates or agents, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages arising out of or otherwise relating to any of the transactions
contemplated herein.

                            FUNDING INDEMNITY LETTER
TO:  Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent

RE:  Credit Agreement,  dated as of June 8, 2007, by and among Riviera Holdings
     Corporation,  a Nevada corporation  (the  "Borrower"), the certain Domestic
                                             --------
    Subsidiaries of the Borrower from time to time party thereto (the

     modified,  extended,  restated,  replaced,  or supplemented  from time to
     time, the "Credit  Agreement";  capitalized  terms used herein and not
               -----------------
    otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement)


DATE     :        [Date]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         This letter is delivered in anticipation of the closing of the
above-referenced Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the most recent
draft of the Credit Agreement circulated to the Borrower and the Lenders.

         The Borrower anticipates that all conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of the Credit Agreement will be satisfied on [Date] (the
"Effective Date"). The Borrower wishes to borrow the [initial Revolving Loans
and the Term Loan], described in the Notice of Borrowing delivered in connection
with this letter agreement, on the Effective Date as LIBOR Rate Loans (the
"Effective Date LIBOR Rate Loans"). In order to induce the Lenders to accept
this request prior to the Effective Date, the Borrower hereby agrees, upon the
written demand of any Lender, to compensate each such Lender for and hold each
such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense such Lender may sustain from
any failure by the Borrower to borrow the Effective Date LIBOR Rate Loans on the
Effective Date, whether as a result of the failure of the Credit Agreement to
become effective on the Effective Date or otherwise, including, without
limitation, any loss or expense which may arise or be attributable to each
Lender's obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to
fund the Effective Date LIBOR Rate Loans.

         The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the
applicable Lender's sole discretion, using any reasonable attribution or
averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A
certificate of such Lender setting forth the basis for determining such amount
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the
Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to
be correct save for manifest error.

         For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the
Lenders under this letter agreement, each Lender may deem that it funded each
LIBOR Rate Loan made by it at the LIBOR Rate for such LIBOR Rate Loan by a
matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore Dollar interbank
market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
LIBOR Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

         This letter agreement shall be governed by, and shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. This letter may
(a) be executed in any number of counterparts by the different signatories
hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts when executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same letter and (b) upon execution, be delivered by facsimile or
electronic mail, which shall be deemed for all purposes to be an original
signature.

[Date]

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, RIVIERA HOLDINGS CORPORATION, a

Agreement and each payment of principal and interest with respect thereto and
its character as a LIBOR Rate Loan or an Alternate Base Rate Loan on Schedule A

other financial institutions from time to time party thereto (the "Lenders") and

(the "Administrative Agent"), and the holder is entitled to the benefits
thereof. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings provided in the Credit Agreement.

         Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the Events of Default
specified in the Credit Agreement, all amounts then remaining unpaid on this
Revolving Note shall become, or may be declared to be, immediately due and
payable, all as provided therein. In the event this Revolving Note is not paid
when due at any stated or accelerated maturity, the Borrower agrees to pay, in
addition to principal and interest, all costs of collection, including
reasonable attorneys' fees.

         All parties now and hereafter liable with respect to this Revolving
Note, whether maker, principal, surety, endorser or otherwise, hereby waive
presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind.

         This Revolving Note may, upon execution, be delivered by facsimile or
electronic mail, which shall be deemed for all purposes to be an original
signature.

         THIS REVOLVING NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                                 LANDLORD WAIVER


Drawn by and return to:
Moore & Van Allen, PLLC
Suite 4700
100 North Tryon Street
Charlotte, North Carolina 28202-4003

         THIS LANDLORD LIEN WAIVER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered as of
this [____] day of [___________, 20__] by and between [______________________],
a [_________________] ("Landlord"), the owner of certain real property,
buildings and improvements located in [_______________], and Wachovia Bank,
National Association, in its capacity as administrative agent (the
"Administrative Agent") for itself and the other lenders (the "Lenders")
providing certain credit facilities pursuant to (i) that certain Credit
Agreement, dated on or about June 8, 2007 (as amended, modified, extended,
restated, replaced, or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement";
capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
set forth in the Credit Agreement) by and among Riviera Holdings Corporation, a
Nevada corporation (the "Borrower"), certain domestic subsidiaries of the
Borrower from time to time party thereto (the "Guarantors" and together with the
Borrower, the "Credit Parties"), the lenders and other financial institutions
from time to time party thereto, and the Administrative Agent.

                                    Recitals:

         A. The Lenders have agreed to provide the Borrower with credit
facilities (the "Credit Facilities") under the terms and conditions of the
Credit Agreement, which credit facilities are guaranteed by the Guarantors. The
Credit Parties have secured the repayment of the Credit Facilities and any
Secured Hedging Agreement (as defined in the Credit Agreement) inter alia by
granting the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and
any Hedging Agreement Provider (as defined in the Credit Agreement), a security
interest in all of the Credit Parties' personal property, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired, including all proceeds of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Collateral").

         B. Whereas Landlord is the lessor under the lease described in Exhibit
A attached hereto (the "Lease") with [_________________] (the "Tenant") as
lessee pursuant to which Landlord has leased certain premises to Tenant located
at [____________________] (the "Premises").

         C. As a condition to extending the Credit Facilities, the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent have requested that the Credit Parties obtain, and
cause the Landlord to provide, a waiver and subordination, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, of all of its rights against any of the Collateral for so
long as the Credit Facilities and the commitments to make the Credit Facilities
remain outstanding.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the mutual
benefits accruing to the Administrative Agent and Landlord as a result of the
credit facilities provided by the Lenders pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the
sufficiency and receipt of such consideration being hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. Landlord hereby subordinates in favor of the Administrative Agent,
each and every party now or hereafter participating as a Lender under the Credit
Agreement and each Hedging Agreement Provider, any and all rights or interests
that Landlord, or its successors and assigns, may now or hereafter have in or to
the Collateral, including, without limitation, any lien, claim, charge or
encumbrance of any kind or nature, arising by statute, contract, common law or
otherwise.

         2. Landlord hereby agrees that the liens and security interests
existing in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of each
and every party now or hereafter participating as a Lender under the Credit
Agreement and each Hedging Agreement Provider, shall be prior and superior to
(i) any and all rights of distraint, levy, and execution which Landlord may now
or hereafter have against the Collateral, (ii) any and all liens and security
interests which Landlord may now or hereafter have on and in the Collateral, and
(iii) any and all other rights, demands and claims of every nature whatsoever
which Landlord may now or hereafter have on or against the Collateral for any
reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, rent, storage charge, or
similar expense, cost or sum due or to become due Landlord by Tenant under the
provisions of any lease, storage agreement or otherwise, and Landlord hereby
subordinates all of its foregoing rights and interests in the Collateral to the
security interest of the Administrative Agent in the Collateral. Landlord deems
the Collateral to be personal property, not fixtures.

         3. Upon the advance written notice from the Administrative Agent that
an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Credit Agreement,
Landlord agrees that the Administrative Agent or its delegates or assigns may
enter upon the Premises at any time or times, during normal business hours, to
inspect or remove the Collateral, or any part thereof, from the Premises,
without charge, either prior to or subsequent to the termination of the Lease,
provided that in any event such removal shall occur no later than forty-five
(45) days after the termination of the Lease. The Administrative Agent shall
repair or pay reasonable compensation to Landlord for damage, if any, to the
Premises caused by the removal of the Collateral. In addition to the above
removal rights, the Landlord will permit the Administrative Agent to remain on
the Premises for forty-five (45) days after the Administrative Agent gives the
Landlord notice of its intention to do so and to take such action as the
Administrative Agent deems necessary or appropriate in order to liquidate the
Collateral, provided that the Administrative Agent shall pay to the Landlord the
basic rent due under the Lease pro-rated on a per diem basis determined on a
30-day month (provided, that such rent shall exclude any rent adjustments,
indemnity payments or similar amounts payable under the Lease for default,
holdover status or similar charges).

         4. Landlord represents and warrants: (a) that it has not assigned its
claims for payment, if any, nor its right to perfect or assert a lien of any
kind whatsoever against Tenant's Collateral; (b) that it has the right, power
and authority to execute this Agreement; (c) that it holds legal title to the
Premises; (d) that it is not aware of any breach or default by the Tenant of its
obligations under the Lease with respect to the Premises; and (e) the Lease,
together with all assignments, modifications, supplementations and amendments
set forth in Exhibit A, represents, as of the date hereof, the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the lease of the Premises. Landlord further
agrees to provide the Administrative Agent with prompt written notice in the
event that Landlord sells the Premises or any portion thereof.

         5. The Landlord shall send to the Administrative Agent (in the manner
provided herein) a copy of any notice or statement sent to the Tenant by the
Landlord asserting a default under the Lease. Such copy shall be sent to the
Administrative Agent at the same time such notice or statement is sent to the
Tenant. Notices shall be sent to the Administrative Agent by prepaid, registered
or certified mail, addressed to the Administrative Agent at the following
address, or such other address as the Administrative Agent shall designate to
the Landlord in writing:

                    Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent
                    201 South College Street, CP8
                    Charlotte, North Carolina 28288-0680
                    Attention: Syndication Agency Services

         6. The Landlord shall not terminate the Lease or pursue any other right
or remedy under the Lease by reason of any default of the Tenant under the
Lease, until the Landlord shall have given a copy of such written notice to the
Administrative Agent as provided above and, in the event any such default is not
cured by the Tenant within any time period provided for under the terms and
conditions of the Lease, the Landlord will allow the Administrative Agent (a)
thirty (30) days from the expiration of the Tenant's cure period under the Lease
within which the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but shall not be
obligated, to remedy such act, omission or other default and Landlord will
accept such performance by the Administrative Agent and (b) up to an additional
sixty (60) days to occupy the Premises; provided that during such period of
occupation the Administrative Agent shall pay to the Landlord the basic rent due
under the Lease pro-rated on a per diem basis determined on a thirty (30) day
month (provided that such rent shall exclude any rent adjustments, indemnity
payments or similar amounts payable under the Lease for default, holdover or
similar charge).

         7. The undersigned will notify all successor owners, transferees,
purchasers and mortgagees of the Premises of the existence of this Agreement.
The agreements contained herein may not be modified or terminated orally and
shall be binding upon the successors, assigns and personal representatives of
the undersigned, upon any successor owner or transferee of the Premises, and
upon any purchasers, including any mortgagee, from the undersigned.

         8. This Agreement shall continue in effect during the term of the
Credit Agreement, and any extensions, renewals or modifications thereof and any
substitutions therefor, shall be binding upon the successors, assigns and
transferees of Landlord, and shall inure to the benefit of the transferees of
Landlord, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent, each
Lender, each Hedging Agreement Provider and their respective successors and
assigns. Landlord hereby waives notice of the Administrative Agent's acceptance
of and reliance on this Agreement.

         9. This Agreement (a) may be executed and delivered in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when
taken together, shall constitute one agreement and (b) may, upon execution, be
delivered by facsimile or electronic mail, which shall be deemed for all
purposes to be an original signature.

         10. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted
in accordance with, the law of the state of New York. All judicial proceedings
brought by the Landlord, the Administrative Agent or the Tenant with respect to
this Agreement may be brought in any state or federal court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of the Landlord, Administrative Agent and the Tenant accepts,
for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally,
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably agrees to
be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby in connection with this
Agreement from which no appeal has been taken or is available.

         11. This Agreement represents the agreement of the Landlord,
Administrative Agent and the Tenant with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the
Landlord, Administrative Agent and the Tenant relative to the subject matter
hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein.
