Buyer&#8217;s Due Diligence and Inspection Rights; Termination Right.                    4.1   Inspection of Property.  Until Closing, and subject to the terms of   Paragraph 4.2, Seller shall provide Buyer and Buyer&#8217;s Representatives access to the Real Property,   upon reasonable prior notice at reasonable times during business hours, with the right and license to   conduct Due Diligence with respect to the Property.                    4.2   Inspection Requirements.  Buyer&#8217;s rights to conduct Due Diligence shall be   subject to the following further requirements: (a) Due Diligence inspections of the Property may only   be performed during normal business hours and Buyer must provide Seller with at least 48 hours&#8217;   prior notice of its intent to perform Due Diligence inspections of the Property; (b) Seller shall have   the right to have a representative of Seller present during any entry upon the Property by Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s   Representatives; (c) there shall be no physical testing of the Property whatsoever, including, without   limitation, any invasive sampling, boring, testing, or analysis of soils, surface water or groundwater at   the Property; (d) Buyer shall immediately return the Property to the condition existing prior to any   inspection.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">     Removal Items.  In addition, Seller may elect (but shall not be obligated) to Remove or cause to be   Removed any other Title Objections, and, with respect thereto, Seller may notify Buyer on or before   the Title Cure Deadline whether Seller elects to Remove the same (and the failure to provide such  notice on or before the Title Cure Deadline shall be deemed to constitute an election of Seller not to   effect any such cure).                    C.    Buyer&#8217;s Right To Terminate.  If any such Title Objection is not so cured on   or before the Title Cure Deadline, then Buyer may Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller within   five (5) Business Days after the Title Cure Deadline.  Failure of Buyer to respond within such period   shall be deemed an election by Buyer to waive such Title Objections and proceed to Closing.  Any   such Title Objection so waived (or deemed waived) by Buyer shall be deemed to constitute a Permitted   Title Exception and the Closing shall occur as herein provided without any reduction of or credit   against the Purchase Price.                  D.    Pre-Closing &#8220;Gap&#8221; Defects.  Whether or not Buyer shall have furnished to   Seller any notice of Title Objections before the Due Diligence Deadline, Buyer may at or prior to   Closing notify Seller of any defects in title arising between the Due Diligence Deadline and the Closing   Date.  With respect to any Title Objections set forth in such notice, Buyer shall have the same rights   as those which apply to any notice of defects in title resulting from a notice of title defects by Buyer   on or before the Due Diligence Deadline and Seller shall have the same rights and obligations to cure   the same at or prior to Closing.  If necessary, the date for Closing shall be automatically extended (by   not more than 15 days) to allow Seller to cure such pre-closing &#8220;gap&#8221; defects.                    4.4   As-Is, Where-Is, With All Faults Sale.  Buyer shall conduct such Due   Diligence as Buyer deems necessary or appropriate prior to the Due Diligence Deadline, and shall   independently confirm to its satisfaction all information that it considers material to its purchase of   the Property or the Transaction.  Accordingly, the Property shall be sold, and Buyer shall accept   possession of the Property on the Closing Date, &#8220;AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS&#8221;, with   no right of setoff or reduction in the Purchase Price.  Without limiting the foregoing, except for Seller&#8217;s   Warranties, none of the Seller Parties have or shall be deemed to have made any verbal or written   representations, warranties, promises or guarantees (whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise)   to Buyer with respect to the Property; any matter set forth, contained or addressed in the Documents   (including, but not limited to, the accuracy and completeness thereof); or the results of Buyer&#8217;s Due   Diligence.  In addition, Buyer expressly understands and acknowledges that any documents made   available to Buyer may not be complete in all respects and that Seller may not have complete   information concerning the Property in Seller&#8217;s possession or control.  Buyer acknowledges that all   such information must be verified independently during Due Diligence.  In addition, Buyer expressly   understands and acknowledges that it is possible that unknown Liabilities may exist with respect to   the Property and that Buyer explicitly took that possibility into account in determining and agreeing   to the Purchase Price, and that a portion of such consideration, having been bargained for between   the parties with the knowledge of the possibility of such unknown Liabilities shall be given in exchange   for the existence of any and all such Liabilities.  In furtherance of the foregoing commitments, Buyer   shall execute and deliver to Seller at the Closing, an As Is Agreement as required by Paragraph 6.3.                4.5   Termination Right.  Buyer may, at any time prior to the Due Diligence   Deadline, Terminate this Agreement by notice to Seller if Buyer, in its sole and absolute discretion,   determines not to proceed with the Transaction or is not satisfied with any matters relating to the   Property.  If, at or prior to the Due Diligence Deadline, Buyer has not given Seller a termination notice                                          3 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">                 H.    Pending Actions or Proceedings.  There are no actions or proceedings   pending or, to Seller&#8217;s knowledge, threatened against Seller or relating to the Property which, if decided   adversely, would impair Seller&#8217;s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent the   use of the Land for the purposes for which Tenant currently uses it.                  I.    Other Prohibitions.  Neither Seller nor, to Seller&#8217;s knowledge, any person   owning a direct interest in Seller (i) is included on any Government List; (ii) has been determined by   competent authority to be subject to the prohibitions contained in Presidential Executive Order No.  133224 (September 23, 2001) or in any enabling or implementing legislation or other Presidential  Executive Orders in respect thereof; (iii) has been previously indicted for or convicted of any felony  involving a crime or crimes of moral turpitude or for any offense under the criminal laws against  terrorists, the criminal laws against money laundering, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, the Money  Laundering Control Act of 1986, as amended, or the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing  Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorists (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001,  Public Law 107-56 (October 26, 2001), as amended; or (iv) to Seller&#8217;s knowledge, is currently under  investigation by any governmental authority for alleged criminal activity.                    J.    Municipal Inspections.  To Seller&#8217;s knowledge, there are no formally   required municipal inspections of the Property required in connection with the delivery of the Deed   (for avoidance of doubt, Seller makes no representation or warranty concerning any inspection that   may be required as a result of Buyer&#8217;s Due Diligence).  In the event the foregoing Seller&#8217;s Warranty is   inaccurate, untrue or incorrect, Seller shall have the right to cure such misrepresentation or breach by   obtaining the required municipal inspection in accordance with the notice and cure provisions set   forth in Section 8.3 below.                8.2   Seller&#8217;s Warranties Deemed Modified.  Because Buyer&#8217;s primary reliance   on the status of the matters addressed by Seller&#8217;s Warranties is Buyer&#8217;s own Due Diligence, to the   extent that Buyer knows prior to the Due Diligence Deadline that Seller&#8217;s Warranties are inaccurate,   untrue or incorrect in any way, such Seller&#8217;s Warranties shall be deemed modified to reflect Buyer&#8217;s   knowledge.  As used herein, &#8220;knows,&#8221; &#8220;knew&#8221; or &#8220;knowledge&#8221; means with respect to any statement   following such phrase that to the date hereof no information has come to the attention of any such   person or such person&#8217;s agents, which would cause such person or its agents to believe that such   statement is not true and correct.                  8.3   Claims of Breach Prior To Closing.  If at or prior to the Closing, Seller   obtains actual knowledge that any Seller&#8217;s Warranty is untrue, inaccurate or incorrect in any material   respect, Seller shall give Buyer notice thereof within five (5) Business Days of obtaining such   knowledge (but, in any event, prior to the Closing).  If at or prior to the Closing Buyer or any Buyer&#8217;s   Representative obtains actual knowledge that any Seller&#8217;s Warranty is untrue, inaccurate or incorrect   in any material respect, Buyer shall give Seller notice thereof within five (5) Business Days of obtaining   such knowledge (but, in any event, prior to the Closing).  In either such event, Seller shall have the   right to cure such misrepresentation or breach and shall be entitled to a reasonable adjournment of   the Closing (not to exceed 15 days) to attempt such cure.  If any Seller&#8217;s Warranty is untrue, inaccurate   or incorrect in any material respect as of the date made, and Seller is unable to so cure such   misrepresentation or breach, then Buyer, as its sole remedy, shall elect either (a) to waive such   misrepresentation or breach and consummate the Transaction without any reduction of or credit   against the Purchase Price, or (b) to Terminate this Agreement by notice given to Seller no later than   five (5) days after the end of such cure period, in which event the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer                                          8 </FONT></DIV>

Seller&#8217;s Warranties shall survive the   Closing and not be merged therein for the Survival Period and Seller shall only be liable to Buyer  hereunder for a breach of Seller&#8217;s Warranties made herein or in any of the documents executed by  Seller at the Closing with respect to which a claim is made by Buyer against Seller in writing, specifying  in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach, within the Survival Period.    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller   for breaches of Seller&#8217;s Warranties shall be subject to Seller&#8217;s Liability Limit.  Notwithstanding the   foregoing, however, if the Closing occurs, Buyer hereby expressly waives, relinquishes and releases   any right or remedy available to it at law, in equity, under this Agreement or otherwise to make a claim   against Seller for damages that Buyer may incur, or to rescind this Agreement and the Transaction, as   the result of any of Seller&#8217;s Warranties being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect if (a) Buyer knew that such   representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate or incorrect at the time of the Closing (Buyer&#8217;s   remedy being as set forth in Paragraph 8.3), or (b) Buyer&#8217;s damages as a result of such representations   or warranties being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect are reasonably estimated to aggregate less than   $37,500.00.                8.5   Buyer&#8217;s Representations and Warranties.  Buyer represents and warrants   to Seller as follows:                A.    Organization, Power and Authority.  Buyer is duly organized, validly   existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware; is, to the extent required by   Law, duly qualified to do business in the State in which the Land is located; and has all necessary   power to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform all its obligations hereunder.  Buyer has the   full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and the execution, delivery and   performance of this Agreement by Buyer (i) has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary   action on the part of Buyer, (ii) does not conflict with or result in a violation of the organizational   documents of Buyer, or any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter in any proceeding to   which Buyer is a party, and (iii) does not conflict with or constitute a material breach of, or constitute   a material default under, any contract, agreement or other instrument by which Buyer is bound or to   which it is a party.  There are no lawsuits pending against Buyer or, to Buyer&#8217;s knowledge, threatened,   the outcome of which could adversely affect Buyer&#8217;s ability to purchase the Property or otherwise   perform its obligations under this Agreement.                B.    Sophisticated Buyer.   Buyer is experienced in the ownership and operation   of properties like and in the locale of the Property, and has experience in the acquisition, ownership   and operation of properties similar to the Property.  Buyer warrants and represents that it has the   ability through its own employees, or through agents, independent contractors, consultants or other   experts with whom it has a relationship, to evaluate fully the material characteristics of the Property   and to assess fully all issues pertaining to title to the Real Property, the value of the Property, the rights   and liabilities of Buyer as the successor to Seller, the structural integrity and soundness of all   improvements and structures located on the Real Property, the environmental condition of the   Property, and the compliance of the Property with all Laws.  Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that,  except for Seller&#8217;s Warranties, Buyer has not and will not rely upon any warranty, representation,  statement of fact, or other information made by or furnished by or on behalf of Seller or any of its   affiliates.                                           9 </FONT></DIV>

No Bankruptcy.  Buyer has not (A) commenced a voluntary case, or had   entered against it a petition, for relief under any federal bankruptcy act or any similar petition, order   or decree under any federal or state Law relative to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors,  (B) caused, suffered or consented to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, administrator, conservator,  liquidator or similar official in any federal, state or foreign judicial or non-judicial proceeding, to hold,  administer and/or liquidate all or substantially all of its assets, or (C) made an assignment for the   benefit of creditors.

Casualty and Condemnation.                    9.1.  Minor Damage.  In the event of loss or damage to the Property or any   portion thereof which is not &#8220;major&#8221; (as hereinafter defined), then Seller shall have the following   option:                A.    Purchase Price Reduction.  If the loss or damage is a fire or other casualty   event, but not a condemnation event, reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the cost (the   &#8220;Restoration Cost&#8221;) of restoring the Property to a condition substantially identical to that of the   Property prior to the event of damage, as determined by a general contractor licensed by the State of   Colorado selected by Seller and reasonably approved by Buyer; or                B.    Assignment.  If the loss or damage is a fire or other casualty event or a   condemnation event, assign to Buyer all of Seller&#8217;s right to any claims and proceeds Seller may have   with respect to any casualty related insurance policies (including, without limitation,  rental loss   proceeds applicable to the period on and after the Closing) or condemnation awards relating to the   premises in question, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the uninsured   portion of the Restoration Cost (including, without limitation, the deductible amount under Seller&#8217;s   insurance policy); or                  C.    Neither of the Foregoing.  Elect neither to reduce the Purchase Price nor   assign insurance proceeds and/or condemnation awards pursuant to the foregoing subparagraphs A.   and B.                                             10 </FONT></DIV>

If Seller makes an election under the foregoing  subparagraphs A. or B., then this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the parties shall  proceed to Closing as contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Seller shall reduce the Purchase  Price and/or assign insurance and/or condemnation proceeds as provided in the foregoing  subparagraphs A. or B., as applicable.  However, if Seller makes (or is deemed to have made) the  election under subparagraph C. above, then Buyer shall have the right to Terminate this Agreement  by written notice delivered to Seller within five (5) days after receiving Seller&#8217;s election (or deemed  election), in which event Buyer shall receive a refund of the Deposit (unless such loss or damage is  caused by or contributed to by Buyer in which event Buyer shall not be entitled to a return of the  Deposit) and neither party shall have any further obligation to the other under this Agreement (except  for those obligations which expressly survive the termination hereof).                  9.2.  Major Damage.

If Buyer does not elect to Terminate this Agreement within   ten (10) days after Seller sends Buyer written notice of the occurrence of major loss or damage, then   Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to proceed with Closing.                  9.3.  Definition of &#8220;Major&#8221; Loss or Damage.

Buyer   and Seller shall indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all Liabilities suffered   or incurred by the indemnified party and arising out of or in connection with a breach by Buyer or   Seller, as the case may be, of the provisions of this Paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to assign this Agreement to (a) an affiliate   of Buyer which is under common control with Buyer or (b) an entity owned by a corporate services   company pursuant to a corporate services agreement with either (1) Buyer or (2) any entity under   common control with Buyer.  Any such assignee so consented to by Seller or otherwise permitted   pursuant to the terms of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph shall be designated by Buyer by the   delivery to Seller of a written assignment of this Agreement pursuant to which Buyer&#8217;s obligations   hereunder are expressly assumed by such assignee, together with delivery to Seller of evidence   reasonably satisfactory to Seller of the valid legal existence of Buyer&#8217;s assignee, its qualification (if  necessary) to do business in the jurisdiction in which the Property is located and of the authority of  Buyer&#8217;s assignee to execute and deliver any and all documents required of Buyer under the terms of  this Agreement, which items shall be received by Seller not less than three (3) Business Days prior to   the Closing Date;  notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise of such right by Buyer shall not relieve   Buyer of any of its obligations and liabilities hereunder including obligations and liabilities which   survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, nor shall any such assignment alter, impair   or relieve such assignee from the waivers, acknowledgements and agreements of Buyer set forth   herein, all of which are binding upon the assignee of Buyer.  In the event of any permitted assignment   by Buyer, any assignee shall assume any and all obligations and liabilities of Buyer under this   Agreement but, notwithstanding such assumption, Buyer shall continue to be liable hereunder.                  14.4  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the state   in which the Land is located.                14.5  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and all the exhibits referenced herein   and annexed hereto contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the matters   contained herein, and no prior agreement or understanding pertaining to any of the matters connected   with this Transaction shall be effective for any purpose.  Neither this Agreement nor any provision   hereof may be waived, modified, amended, discharged or terminated except by an instrument signed   by the party against whom the enforcement of such waiver, modification, amendment, discharge or   termination is sought, and then only to the extent set forth in such instrument.                  14.6  Time Is of the Essence.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE of the Transaction   and this Agreement.                14.7  Interpretation.  The titles, captions and paragraph headings are inserted for   convenience only and are in no way intended to interpret, define, limit or expand the scope or content   of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  If any party to this Agreement is made up of more than   one person or entity, then all such persons and entities shall be included jointly and severally, even   though the defined term for such party is used in the singular in this Agreement.  If any time period   under this Agreement ends on a day other than a Business Day, then the time period shall be extended   until the next Business Day.  This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption   or other rule requiring construction against the party causing this Agreement to be drafted.

The covenants, agreements, indemnities, representations and   warranties contained herein shall not survive the Closing Date or any termination of this Agreement,   except as set forth in Paragraphs 8, 11, 13 and 14, each of which shall survive the Closing or any earlier   termination of this Agreement (limited, as applicable, as set forth therein).                14.9  Exclusive Application.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be   construed to confer upon or to give to any person, firm or corporation other than Buyer and Seller   hereto any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  All terms and conditions of   this Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, and such benefit may   not be assigned by Buyer except as set forth in Paragraph 14.3.                  14.10 Partial Invalidity.  If all or any portion of any of the provisions of this   Agreement shall be declared invalid by Laws applicable thereto, then the performance of said   offending provision shall be excused by the parties hereto; provided, however, that, if the performance   of such excused provision materially affects any material aspect of this Transaction and the other party   does not upon demand enter into a modification or separate agreement which sets forth in valid   fashion the covenants of such offending provision in a manner which counsel to both parties   determine is valid, then the party hereto for whose benefit such excused provision was inserted in this  Agreement shall have the right, exercisable by notice given to the other party within ten (10) days after  such provision is so declared invalid, to Terminate this Agreement.                  14.11 Waiver Rights.  Buyer reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any   provision hereof which is for the benefit of Buyer.  Seller reserves the right to waive, in whole or in   part, any provision hereof that is for the benefit of Seller.                  14.12 No Implied Waiver.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this   Agreement, no waiver by Seller or Buyer of any provision hereof shall be deemed to have been made   unless expressed in writing and signed by such party, and no delay or omission in the exercise of any   right or remedy accruing to Seller or Buyer upon any breach under this Agreement shall impair such   right or remedy or be construed as a waiver of any such breach theretofore or thereafter occurring.    The waiver by Seller or Buyer of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein stated shall not   be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach, or of a subsequent breach of the same or any other   term, covenant or condition herein contained.                  14.13 Rights Cumulative.  All rights, powers, options or remedies afforded to Seller   or Buyer either hereunder or by Law shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of one   right, power, option or remedy shall not bar other rights, powers, options or remedies allowed herein   or by Law, unless expressly provided to the contrary herein.                14.14 Attorneys&#8217; Fees.  Should either party employ an attorney or attorneys to   enforce any of the provisions hereof or to protect its interest in any manner arising under this   Agreement, or to recover damages for breach of this Agreement, the non-prevailing party in any action   pursued in a court of competent jurisdiction (the finality of which is not legally contested) shall pay to   the prevailing party all reasonable costs, damages and expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees, expended or   incurred in connection therewith. Such recovery shall be mandatory and shall not be in the discretion   of the court.                                             17 </FONT></DIV>
