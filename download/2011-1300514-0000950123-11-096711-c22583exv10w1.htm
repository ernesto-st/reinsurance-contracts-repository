give rise to any compensation pursuant to this subsection 2.6D under clause (ii)&nbsp;of the preceding
sentence, and no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
then at the Borrower&#146;s option upon five Business Days&#146; notice to the Administrative Agent, the
applicable prepayment amount may be deposited irrevocably into the Prepayment Account in lieu of
payment to the applicable Lenders. Such funds shall be held in the Prepayment Account until the

Prepayment Account shall not constitute a prepayment of principal and all principal to be prepaid
using the proceeds from such account shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable

outstanding New Term Loans, New Term Loan Commitments, New Revolving Loans, New Revolving Loan

Refinancing Amendment may provide for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the
Borrower or other Loan Parties or the provision to the Borrower of swing line loans pursuant to any
Other Commitments established thereby, in each case, on terms substantially equivalent to the terms

Refinancing Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of
any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to a
Refinancing Amendment without the consent of any other Lenders to the extent (but only to the
extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Credit Agreement Refinancing
Indebtedness incurred pursuant thereto (including any amendments necessary to treat the Loans and
Commitments subject thereto as Other Loans and/or Other Commitments). Any Refinancing Amendment
