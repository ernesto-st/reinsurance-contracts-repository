defined in the Employment Letter). This grant has been made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Alleghany (the &#147;<U>Committee</U>&#148;) pursuant to the terms of the Alleghany Corporation 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
&#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;). The applicable terms of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference. Any terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Plan. Any ambiguity between any term used in this Agreement and a
term used in the Plan shall be resolved in favor of and in accordance with the term used in the Plan. Any interpretation, determination or decision made or taken by the Committee regarding the Plan or this Agreement shall be final and binding upon
Alleghany and the Participant. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;2. <U>Restricted Stock Units</U>. The Restricted Stock Units are notional units
of measurement denominated in shares of Common Stock and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, Alleghany shall pay or provide to the Participant in accordance with Section&nbsp;5 (x)&nbsp;a payment in cash in respect
of such Restricted Stock Units (as adjusted hereunder) in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on the applicable Vesting Date (as defined below) of the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units (as adjusted
hereunder) to which the Participant is entitled to payment as of the applicable Vesting Date, or (y)&nbsp;a share of Common Stock with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit (as adjusted hereunder) to which the Participant is entitled to payment as
of the applicable Vesting Date, with the form of such payment to be determined in the discretion of the Committee as set forth in Section&nbsp;5 below. Alleghany shall establish on its books a Restricted Stock Unit Account for the Participant and
shall credit the hereby-granted Restricted Stock Units thereto. The Restricted Stock Unit Account shall be debited in respect of any disposition of Owned Shares as provided in Section&nbsp;3 hereof. The Restricted Stock Unit Account shall reflect
the investment experience which the account would have had if such account held whole or fractional shares of Common Stock equal to the number of credited Restricted Stock Units. The Restricted Stock Unit Account shall be equitably adjusted as
appropriate to reflect cash and stock dividends, stock splits, and other similar distributions and/or major corporate events which may, from time to time, occur with respect to Alleghany and/or Common Stock prior to the Vesting Date. Dividends and
other distributions shall be automatically credited to the Restricted Stock Unit Account at their cash value or the fair market value of any non-cash dividend or other distribution and shall be deemed to purchase Restricted Stock Units at a price
equal to the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the date of payment thereof. </FONT></P>

Restricted Stock Units that the Participant shall have maintained unencumbered beneficial ownership of the Owned Shares in respect of which such Restricted Stock Units were credited, and any stock dividends or stock splits paid in respect thereof,
continuously throughout the period commencing with the initial purchase of Owned Shares and ending on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant (the &#147;<U>Ownership Period</U>&#148;), and that the Participant shall not (i)&nbsp;have sold,
assigned, transferred, pledged, or hypothecated the Owned Shares, including any stock dividends paid in respect thereof, or (ii)&nbsp;have engaged in any short sale or other transaction that would have the effect of decreasing his economic risk with
regard to the Owned Shares, including any stock dividends paid in respect thereof, at any time during the Ownership Period (any such action in subsection (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;being hereinafter referred to as a &#147;<U>disposition</U>&#148;). In
the event of a disposition of any of the Owned Shares, or related stock dividend shares, during the Ownership Period, the Participant&#146;s Restricted Stock Unit Account shall be debited in an amount equal to one Restricted Stock Unit for each
Owned Share so disposed (the &#147;<U>Disposed Owned Share</U>&#148;), together with the investment experience and dividends and distributions theretofore credited from the date of purchase of the Disposed Owned Share. The Participant shall provide
such evidence and certification of continued satisfaction of such continuous ownership requirement (including certification that he has not effected a disposition of any Owned Shares) from time to time as requested by Alleghany. Evidence of
continued satisfaction of the continuous ownership requirement requested by Alleghany may include certification of ownership by a brokerage or other financial institution. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this Section&nbsp;3, the Owned
Shares, and related stock dividend shares, shall at all times throughout the Ownership Period remain the property of the Participant and be subject to his exclusive control and, with respect thereto, the Participant shall have all rights of a
stockholder of Alleghany. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your termination of employment for any reason, including your death and Total Disability (as defined in the Employment Letter), and in connection with a merger approved by the
Board of Directors of Alleghany effectuated by a tender offer, or other major corporate transaction approved by the Board of Directors of Alleghany with respect to Alleghany Common Stock, the Ownership Period applicable to the Owned Shares and
related stock dividend shares shall terminate and such Owned Shares shall become freely transferable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;4.
