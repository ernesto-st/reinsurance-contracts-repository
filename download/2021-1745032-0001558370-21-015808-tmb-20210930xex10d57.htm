The risk of loss relating to the Contributor&#8217;s Property prior to Closing shall be borne by the Contributor.

Escrow shall be opened by the Operating Partnership with First American Title Company (the &#8220;Closing Agent&#8221;) upon execution of this Agreement by both parties. The Operating Partnership will deposit an earnest money deposit of $50,000 (the &#8220;Earnest Money&#8221;) which shall be applied to the cash payable by the Operating Partnership at the Closing. A copy of this fully-executed Agreement will be delivered to the Closing Agent by the Operating Partnership and will serve as escrow instructions together with any additional instructions required by the Contributor and/or the Operating Partnership or their respective counsels. The Contributor and the Operating Partnership agree to cooperate with the Closing Agent and sign any additional instructions reasonably required by the Closing Agent to close escrow.

If the Contributor shall fail to undertake such defense within 30 days after such notice, or within such shorter time as may be reasonable under the circumstances or as required by applicable law, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such liability or claim on behalf of and for the account of the Contributor at the Contributor&#8217;s sole cost and expense. 21 </font></p></td></tr></table></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><font style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</font></p><p style="display:none;line-height:0pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><font style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:0pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</font></p></div></div><hr style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;color:#000000;height:2pt;line-height:0;margin-bottom:30pt;margin-left:5.88%;margin-right:5.88%;margin-top:30pt;page-break-after:always;width:88.24%;border-width:0;"><div style="max-width:100%;padding-left:5.88%;padding-right:5.88%;position:relative;"><div style="clear:both;max-width:100%;position:relative;"><div><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-size:16pt;height:max-content;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;table-layout:auto;width:100%;" align="center"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;width:93%;margin:0pt;padding:0pt 5.4pt 0pt 5.4pt;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><img src="tmb-20210930xex10d57025.jpg" alt="1057_1057_page_25.gif" style="display:inline-block;height:660pt;left:0.3%;padding-bottom:0pt;position:relative;top:0pt;width:510pt;"></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;width:7%;margin:0pt;padding:0pt 5.4pt 0pt 5.4pt;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:1pt;margin:0pt;"><font style="color:#ffffff;">5.4 Limitations on Indemnification Under Section 5.2.1.

The Parties intend to exchange Confidential Information to one another in connection with the possibility of engaging in the transaction described in the Contribution Agreement (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). In consideration of the promises exchanged herein, the Parties hereto agree that the following terms and conditions shall apply when one Party discloses &quot;Confidential Information&quot; to the other Party: 1. DEFINITION OF &#8220;CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION&#8221;. As used in this Agreement, the term &#8220;Confidential Information&#8221; means all information relating to or used in the Partnership&#8217;s business, regardless of whether it is marked &#8220;confidential&#8221; or otherwise. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, all business processes and procedures, systems, methods of doing business, data, reports, specifications, formulae, proposals, strategies, business plans and analyses, financial information and projections, investment strategy, marketing, advertising, promotions, market research, plans, information about past, present or potential investors, information about past, present or potential vendors, information about existing or future technology, and proprietary software or models. Without limiting the foregoing, the term &#8220;Confidential Information&#8221; expressly includes: the Partnership&#8217;s investment strategies, including without limitation the possibility of entering into an umbrella real estate investment trust (&#8220;UPREIT&#8221;) transaction; and potential details related to the Transaction, including without limitation potential Transaction terms, provisions, and pricing. The foregoing notwithstanding, the term &#8220;Confidential Information&#8221; does not include information that: a) Is or becomes known to the public through no fault of the receiving Party; b) The receiving Party already rightfully possessed before the disclosing Party disclosed it to the receiving Party; c) Is subsequently disclosed to the receiving Party by a third-party who is not under obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or d) The receiving Party develops independently without using Confidential Information. 2. NON-DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. Neither Party shall not disclose Confidential Information of the other Party to any of its officers, directors, employees, contractors or agents or to any third-party without the disclosing Party&#8217;s written consent, except that (a) the receiving Party may disclose such information to its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents whose duties justify their need to know such Confidential Information, and who have been clearly informed of their obligation to maintain the confidential status of such Confidential Information, and in the case of contractors or agents, who have signed a written document acknowledging the obligation to maintain the confidential status of Confidential Information, and shall cause them to comply fully with these obligations; and (b) the receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable federal, state or local law, regulation, court order, or other legal process, provided such Party has given the disclosing Party prior written notice of such required disclosure and, to the extent reasonably possible, has given the disclosing Party an opportunity to contest such required disclosure at the disclosing Party&#8217;s expense. 3. PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The receiving Party shall use the same care to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information as such Party uses with respect to its own confidential information of a similar nature, which shall not in any case be less than the care a Exhibit F 1 </font></p></td></tr></table></div><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><font style="visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</font></p><p style="display:none;line-height:0pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><font style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:0pt;visibility:hidden;">&#8203;</font></p></div></div><hr style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;color:#000000;height:2pt;line-height:0;margin-bottom:30pt;margin-left:5.88%;margin-right:5.88%;margin-top:30pt;page-break-after:always;width:88.24%;border-width:0;"><div style="max-width:100%;padding-left:5.88%;padding-right:5.88%;position:relative;"><div style="clear:both;max-width:100%;position:relative;"><div><table style="border-collapse:collapse;font-size:16pt;height:max-content;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;table-layout:auto;width:100%;" align="center"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;width:93%;margin:0pt;padding:0pt 5.4pt 0pt 5.4pt;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:10pt;text-align:center;margin:0pt;"><img src="tmb-20210930xex10d57042.jpg" alt="1057_1057_page_42.gif" style="display:inline-block;height:660pt;left:0.3%;padding-bottom:0pt;position:relative;top:0pt;width:510pt;"></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;width:7%;margin:0pt;padding:0pt 5.4pt 0pt 5.4pt;"><p style="font-family:'Times New Roman','Times','serif';font-size:1pt;margin:0pt;"><font style="color:#ffffff;">reasonable business person would use under similar circumstances. Without limiting the foregoing, the receiving Party shall take reasonable action by instruction, agreement or otherwise with respect to such Party&#8217;s employees or other persons permitted access to Confidential Information to cause them to comply fully with the receiving Party&#8217;s obligations hereunder. 4. PERMITTED USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The receiving Party may not use the Confidential Information directly or indirectly for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally disclosed, or for any purposes which could be deemed to be adverse to or competitive with the disclosing Party&#8217;s business. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall impair Buyer&#8217;s right (or the right of any permitted assignee or Lodging Fund REIT III, Inc. (&#8220;Parent&#8221;)) to disclose information relating to this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement, or the Property (a) to any due diligence representatives and/or consultants that are engaged by, work for or are acting on behalf of, any securities dealers, investment advisors and/or broker-dealers evaluating Buyer, its permitted assignees or Parent, (b) in connection with any filings with governmental agencies (including the Securities and Exchange Commission) by Parent, (c) to any broker-dealers or investment advisors in Parent&#8217;s selling group and any of Parent&#8217;s investors, including pursuant to the confidential offering memorandum used in connection with Parent&#8217;s ongoing private offering, and (d) to the public as long as such information does not specifically disclose the identity of the Contributor or the Property if such disclosure occurs before the end of the Due Diligence Period. 5. DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Upon the written request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall cease using and arrange for the destruction of all copies of any Confidential Information then in the receiving Party&#8217;s possession or under such Party&#8217;s control. The receiving Party agrees to dispose of the Confidential Information in such a manner that the information cannot be read or reconstructed after destruction. Upon the written request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall certify in writing that it has complied with the obligations set forth in this paragraph. 6. INFORMATION SECURITY. (a) The receiving Party shall take appropriate measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Confidential Information; (b) the receiving Party shall restrict access to Confidential Information to those officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents or other third parties whose access the disclosing Party deems appropriate; (c) Confidential Information shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement indefinitely; and (d) the disclosing Party shall have the right to review the receiving Party&#8217;s operations and procedures to ensure compliance with the foregoing requirements. The receiving Party agrees to indemnify the disclosing Party for all reasonable fees, costs, charges, and expenses resulting from any unauthorized access to Confidential Information. 7. OWNERSHIP OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The disclosing Party shall retain all right, title and interest in and to its own Confidential Information. Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure of Confidential Information shall be deemed to grant the receiving Party any license or other intellectual property right. 8. DISCLAIMERS. The receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the disclosing Party provides Confidential Information disclosed hereunder on an &#8220;AS IS&#8221; basis, without warranties of any kind, except as specified in Section 7 above. Without limiting the foregoing, the disclosing Party does not represent or warrant that Confidential Information is accurate, complete or current. The disclosure of Confidential Information containing business plans is for planning purposes only. The disclosing Party may change or cancel its plans at any time at such Party&#39;s sole discretion. The receiving Party further acknowledges and understands that disclosure of Confidential Information is not a representation that the parties will enter into any type of business relationship. 9. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The receiving Party acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure by such Party of Confidential Information would cause immediate and irreparable damage that could not be fully remedied by monetary damages. The receiving Party therefore agrees that the disclosing Party may specifically enforce this Agreement and shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure without the necessity of proving actual damage.
