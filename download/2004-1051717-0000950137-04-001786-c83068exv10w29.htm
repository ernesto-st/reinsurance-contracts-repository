<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of December&nbsp;8, 2003, among AMERUS GROUP CO., an
Iowa corporation (the &#147;Borrower&#148;), the lending institutions listed from time to
time on Annex I hereto (each a &#147;Bank&#148; and, collectively, the &#147;Banks&#148;), THE BANK
OF NEW YORK, BANK ONE, NA, FLEET NATIONAL BANK and MELLON BANK, N.A., as
Co-Syndication Agents, and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as Administrative Agent (the
&#147;Administrative Agent&#148;). Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized
terms used herein and defined in Section&nbsp;9 are used herein as so defined.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">W I T N E S S E T H :


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Banks are willing to make available to the Borrower the credit facility
provided for herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1. Amount and Terms of Credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.01 Commitments. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Bank severally agrees, at any time and from time to time on and
after the Effective Date and prior to the Maturity Date, to make a loan or
loans (each, a &#147;Loan&#148; and, collectively, the &#147;Loans&#148;) to the Borrower, which
Loans (i)&nbsp;shall, at the option of the Borrower, be Base Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Loans, provided that except as otherwise specifically provided in
Section&nbsp;1.10(b), all Loans comprising the same Borrowing shall at all times be
of the same Type, (ii)&nbsp;may be repaid and reborrowed at any time in accordance
with the provisions hereof, (iii)&nbsp;shall have an aggregate principal amount at
any time outstanding which, when added to such Bank&#146;s Percentage of the
aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Unpaid
Drawings which are repaid with the proceeds of, and simultaneously with the
incurrence of, the respective incurrence of Loans at such time), does not
exceed for any Bank that amount which equals the Commitment of such Bank at
such time, and (iv)&nbsp;shall have an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding which, when added to all Letter of Credit Outstandings at such
time, does not exceed for all Banks that amount which equals the Total
Commitment at such time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.02 Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing; Maximum Number of Borrowings. The
aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing hereunder shall not be less than
$5,000,000 and, if in excess thereof, shall be in an integral multiple of
$1,000,000. More than one Borrowing may be incurred on any day; provided that
at no time shall there be outstanding more than six Borrowings of Eurodollar
Loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.03 Notice of Borrowing. (a)&nbsp;In connection with its incurrence of Loans
on any Business Day, including the Effective Date, the Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent at its Notice Office, prior to 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New York time),
at least three Business Days&#146; prior written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) of each Eurodollar Loan or at least one Business
Day&#146;s prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing)
of each Base Rate Loan. Such notice (the &#147;Notice of Borrowing&#148;), except as otherwise
expressly provided in Section&nbsp;1.10, shall be irrevocable, and, in the case of a
written notice and a confirmation of telephonic notice, shall be in the form of
Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto, appropriately

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">completed to specify (i)&nbsp;the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii)&nbsp;the
date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and (iii)&nbsp;whether the
respective Borrowings shall consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans and,
if Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Bank written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each proposed Borrowing, of
such Bank&#146;s proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by the
Notice of Borrowing.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm
in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the Administrative
Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon
the basis of such telephonic notice, believed by the Administrative Agent in
good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower. In each such case
the Administrative Agent&#146;s record of the terms of any such telephonic notice
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.04 Disbursement of Funds. (a)&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth, no later than 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New York time) on the date of each
incurrence of Loans, each Bank will make available to the Administrative Agent
its pro rata share of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the
manner provided below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Each Bank shall make available all amounts it is to fund under any
Borrowing in U.S. dollars and immediately available funds to the Administrative
Agent at the Administrative Agent&#146;s Payment Office and the Administrative Agent
will make available to the Borrower as promptly as practicable by depositing to
its account at the Administrative Agent&#146;s Payment Office the aggregate of the
amounts so made available in the type of funds received. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Bank prior to the date of
any such Borrowing that such Bank does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on
such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing, and
the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower
a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made
available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank and the Administrative Agent
has made available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Bank. If such Bank
does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative
Agent&#146;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent within two Business Days. The Administrative Agent shall
also be entitled to recover from the Bank or the Borrower, as the case may be,
interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the
Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (x)&nbsp;if paid by such Bank,
the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate or (y)&nbsp;if paid by the Borrower, the then applicable rate of
interest, calculated in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.08(a) or (b), as the case may
be, for the respective Loans.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Nothing in this Section&nbsp;1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Bank from
its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights
which the Borrower may have against any Bank as a result of any default by such
Bank hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.05 Notes. (a)&nbsp;The Borrower&#146;s obligation to pay the principal of, and
interest on, all the Loans made to it by each Bank shall be evidenced by a
promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;B with blanks
appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each a &#147;Note&#148; and collectively,
the &#147;Notes&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Note issued to each Bank shall (i)&nbsp;be executed by the Borrower,
(ii)&nbsp;be payable to the order of such Bank and be dated the Effective Date (or
if issued after the Effective Date, be dated the date of the issuance thereof),
(iii)&nbsp;be in a stated principal amount equal to the Commitment of such Bank and
be payable in a principal amount equal to the amount of the Loans made by such
Bank and which are outstanding from time to time, (iv)&nbsp;mature on the Maturity
Date, (v)&nbsp;bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of Section&nbsp;1.08
in respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans, as the case may be,
evidenced thereby, (vi)&nbsp;be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in
Section&nbsp;3.01 and mandatory repayment as provided in Section&nbsp;3.02 and (vii)&nbsp;be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.
Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of the Bank (together with a
customary indemnity from such Bank in form and substance satisfactory to the
Borrower) that a Note has been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, the
Borrower will issue a replacement Note in the same principal amount thereof and
otherwise of like tender.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Each Bank will record on its internal records the amount of each Loan
made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any transfer
of its Note endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal
amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation or any
error in any such notation shall not affect the Borrower&#146;s obligations in
respect of such Loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.06 Conversions. The Borrower shall have the option to convert on any
Business Day all or a portion at least equal to $5,000,000 (and, if in excess
thereof, an integral multiple of $1,000,000) of the outstanding principal
amount of the Loans of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of the other
Type of Loan; provided that (i)&nbsp;no partial conversion of a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of the
Eurodollar Loans pursuant to such Borrowing to less than $5,000,000, (ii)&nbsp;Base
Rate Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if no Default or Event
of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion, (iii)&nbsp;Borrowings of
Eurodollar Loans resulting from this Section&nbsp;1.06 shall be limited in number as
provided in Section&nbsp;1.02, (iv)&nbsp;Eurodollar Loans may only be converted into Base
Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (v)
each such conversion shall be made pro rata among the Loans of each Bank of the
Type being converted. Each such conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent
at its Notice Office, prior to 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New York time), at least three
Business Days&#146; (or one Business Day&#146;s in the case of a conversion into Base
Rate Loans) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) (each a &#147;Notice of Conversion&#148;) specifying the Loans to be so
converted, the Type of Loans to be converted into and, if to be converted into
a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Bank prompt notice of any
such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans.

Banks&#146; Commitments. It is understood that no Bank shall be responsible for any
default by any other Bank in its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that

and (ii)&nbsp;the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan pursuant to

contained above:

which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on
the next succeeding Business Day, provided that if any Interest
Period would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day
but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day
occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
preceding Business Day;

Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet
been incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower or, in the case of a
Notice of Borrowing, shall, at the option of the Borrower, be deemed converted
into a Notice of Borrowing for Base Rate Loans to be made on the date of

additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method
of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Bank shall determine in good
faith) as shall be required to compensate such Bank for such increased costs or
reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the
additional amounts owed to such Bank, showing the basis for the calculation
thereof, which basis shall be reasonable and consistently applied, submitted to
the Borrower by such Bank shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive

shall set forth the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which
basis must be reasonable and consistently applied, although the failure to
give any such notice shall not release or diminish any of the Borrower&#146;s

without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Bank to

misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Issuing Bank as determined by
a final judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the
Administrative Agent so notifies any Participant required to fund an Unpaid Drawing under a Letter of Credit
prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Participant shall
make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank
such Participant&#146;s Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business
Day in same day funds. If and to the extent such Participant shall not have so
made its Percentage of the amount of such Unpaid Drawing available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Participant
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank,
forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day
from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Issuing Bank at the overnight Federal Funds Effective
Rate. The failure of any Participant to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank its Percentage of any Unpaid Drawing
under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other Participant of its
obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Issuing Bank its Percentage of any payment under any Letter of
Credit on the date required, as specified above, but no Participant shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Participant to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank such other
Participant&#146;s Percentage of any such payment.

If, after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Loans, as set
forth above, the Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Total Commitment,
the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office on
such date an amount of cash and/or cash equivalents equal to the amount of such
excess, such cash and/or cash equivalents to be held as security for all
obligations of the Borrower to the Banks hereunder in a cash collateral account

which made, provided that: (i)&nbsp;if any repayment of Eurodollar Loans made
pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Eurodollar Loans
made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than $5,000,000 such
Borrowing shall be converted immediately into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans

or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Banks. Each Bank may at any time grant participations
in any of its rights hereunder or under any of its Notes to any bank or other
financial institution; provided that in the case of any such participation, the
participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other
Credit Documents, including rights of consent, approval or waiver (the participant&#146;s
rights against such Bank in respect of such participation to be
those set forth in the agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the

Sections&nbsp;1.10, 1.11 and 3.04 of this Agreement to, and only to, the extent that
such Bank would be entitled to such benefits if the participation had not been
entered into or sold; and provided further, that no Bank shall transfer, grant

approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i)&nbsp;extend the

participating or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
thereon or Fees, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase such

preceding sentence shall, to the extent such transaction represents an
assignment to an institution other than one or more Banks hereunder, be in an
aggregate amount less than the minimum of $5,000,000 unless otherwise agreed to

of any such assignment, (i)&nbsp;Annex I shall be deemed to be amended to reflect
the Commitments, if any, and outstanding Loans of the respective assignee
(which shall result in a direct reduction to the Commitments, if any, and
outstanding Loans of the assigning Bank) and of the other Banks, (ii)&nbsp;if any
such assignment occurs after the Effective Date, at the request of the assignor
or the assignee the Borrower will issue new Notes to the respective assignee
and to the assigning Bank in conformity with the requirements of Section&nbsp;1.05
and (iv)&nbsp;the Administrative Agent shall receive from the assigning Bank and/or
the assignee Bank or financial institution at the time of each assignment the payment of a
nonrefundable assignment fee of $3,500, provided that such transfer or
assignment will not be effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on
the Register pursuant to Section&nbsp;11.17 hereof. At the time of each assignment
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;11.04(b) to a Person which is not already a Bank
hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in
Section&nbsp;7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes, the
respective assignee Bank shall provide to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms (and, if applicable a
Section&nbsp;3.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section&nbsp;3.04(b). Each Bank and
the Borrower agrees to execute such documents (including, without limitation,
amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents) as shall be
necessary to effect the foregoing. Promptly following any assignment pursuant
to this Section&nbsp;11.04(b), the assigning Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent thereof. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;11.04 shall
prevent or prohibit any Bank from pledging its Loans or Notes hereunder to a
Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Bank from such
Federal Reserve Bank.

with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the &#147;Blue Sky&#148; laws of any State.

Bank that has consented in writing to waive its pro rata share of such payment)

respect to which such payment was received.

the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to
the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of
any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the
Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly
executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section
11.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of
assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the assigning or transferor Bank shall surrender the Note
evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Bank and/or the
new Bank. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever
nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section&nbsp;11.17 (but
excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the
extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Administrative Agent).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.18 Executive Stock Purchase Program. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may establish and administer
an executive stock purchase program pursuant to which the Borrower offers to
employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries the opportunity to purchase from
the Borrower treasury shares of the Borrower&#146;s common stock using either
personal funds of such employees or funds borrowed from a third-party financial
institution, which loans may be guaranteed by the Borrower; provided that at no
time shall the aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans guaranteed by
the Borrower pursuant to this Section&nbsp;11.18 exceed $25,000,000. In addition,
so long as no Default or Event of Default exists or would result therefrom,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and in
addition to any other funds available to the Borrower for such purpose, the
Borrower may use the proceeds received from the employees pursuant to the
common stock purchases described above in this Section&nbsp;11.18 to make purchases
of its common stock and/or convertible equity units in the open market or
otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.19 Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;the Borrower may create or acquire one or more
Subsidiaries and designate (by written notice to the Administrative Agent and
each Bank) such Subsidiary or Subsidiaries as an &#147;Unrestricted Subsidiary&#148;
(which Unrestricted Subsidiaries may include, without limitation, any Person
which is a Subsidiary of the Borrower on the Effective Date, (ii)&nbsp;such
Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall not (x)&nbsp;constitute Material Subsidiaries, (y)
constitute Subsidiaries for purposes of the definition of Material Subsidiaries
