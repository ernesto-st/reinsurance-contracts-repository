                  time to time determines in the Administrative Agent's
                  reasonable discretion as being appropriate (determined in
                  accordance with its customary credit considerations) to
                  reflect the impediments to the Administrative Agent's ability
                  to realize upon the Collateral. Without limiting the
                  generality of the foregoing, Availability Reserves may include

                  "prime rate", such rate being a reference rate and not
                  necessarily representing the lowest or best rate being charged
                  to any customer, and (b) one-half of one percent (1/2%) above
                  the Federal Funds Effective Rate. For the purposes of this
                  definition, "FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE" shall mean for any
                  day, the rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the
                  rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of
                  the Federal Reserve System arranged by federal funds brokers,
                  as published for such day (or, if such day is not a Business
                  Day, for the next preceding Business Day) by the Federal
                  Reserve Bank of New York, or, if such rate is not so published
                  for any day that is a Business Day, the average of the
                  quotations for such day on such transactions received by Fleet
                  National Bank from three funds brokers of recognized standing

                  resulting from any changes in Fleet National Bank's "PRIME
                  RATE" shall take place immediately without notice or demand of
                  any kind.

         BASE RATE LOANS. Revolving Credit Loans bearing interest calculated

                        2. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

2.1. COMMITMENT TO LEND. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agrees to lend to the
Borrowers, and the Borrowers on a joint and several basis may borrow, repay, and
reborrow from time to time from the Closing Date up to but not including the
Maturity Date upon notice by the Borrowers' Representative to the Administrative
Agent given in accordance with ss.2.9, such sums as are requested by the
Borrowers' Representative up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding (after
giving effect to all amounts requested) at any one time equal to such Revolving
Credit Lender's Commitment MINUS such Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment
Percentage of the sum of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations, PROVIDED that the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Credit
Lenders shall have no obligation to make any Revolving Credit Loans which would
constitute an OverLoan and the Borrowers shall never allow Availability to be
less than $0. Each request for a Revolving Credit Loan hereunder shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrowers that the conditions
set forth in ss.11 and ss.12, in the case of the initial Revolving Credit Loans
to be made on the Closing Date, and ss.12, in the case of all other Revolving
Credit Loans, have been satisfied on the date of such request. No Revolving
Credit Lender has any obligation to make any Revolving Credit Loan, or otherwise
to provide any credit to or for the benefit of the Borrowers where the result of
such loan, advance, or credit is an OverLoan.

2.2. MATURITY. The Borrowers jointly and severally promise to pay on the
Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Maturity
Date, all of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such date, together with
any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

2.3. UNUSED FEE. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Revolving Credit Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages a commitment fee (the
"UNUSED FEE") calculated at the rate of three eighth's of one percent (0.375%)
on the average daily amount during each calendar month or portion thereof from
the date hereof to the Maturity Date by which the Total Commitment MINUS the sum
of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations exceeds
the outstanding amount of Revolving Credit Loans during such calendar month. The
Unused Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month



                                      -25-
<PAGE>

for the immediately preceding month commencing on the first such date following
the date hereof, with a final payment on the Maturity Date or any earlier date
on which the Commitments shall terminate.

2.4. REDUCTION OF COMMITMENT. The Borrowers shall have the right, at any time
and from time to time upon five (5) Business Days written notice to the
Administrative Agent, to reduce by $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, or terminate entirely the Total Commitment,
whereupon the Commitments of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be reduced PRO
RATA in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages of the amount
specified in such notice, or as the case may be, terminated. Promptly after
receiving any notice of the Borrowers delivered pursuant to this ss.2.4, the
Administrative Agent will notify the Revolving Credit Lenders of the substance
thereof. If the Borrowers repay or prepay all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans
or the Total Commitment is reduced or terminated during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, the Borrowers shall pay to
the Administrative Agent a premium in an amount equal to the Commitment
Reduction Fee of the amount of the reduction of the Total Commitment or on the
amount of the Total Commitment immediately prior to such repayment or prepayment
or the first of a related series of prepayments or repayments, as the case may
be (the "REVOLVING CREDIT EARLY TERMINATION FEE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no
Revolver Early Termination Fee shall be due if the Total Commitment is
terminated in connection with the Borrowers entering into a new credit facility
agented by the FRFI. No reduction or termination of the Total Commitment may be
reinstated. The "COMMITMENT REDUCTION FEE" shall be one percent (1%); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, if an Approved Recapitalization has occurred, the Commitment Reduction
Fee shall be one-half of one percent (0.5%) during the period from the date of
the Approved Recapitalization through the day which is ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date.

2.5. MANDATORY REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. If at any time Availability
is less than $0 or there is an OverLoan, then the Borrowers shall immediately
pay to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of the Revolving
Credit Lenders for application amounts necessary so that Availability is $0 or
greater and there are no OverLoans to be applied: first, to any Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligations; second, to the Revolving Credit Loans; and third, to
provide to the Administrative Agent cash collateral for Reimbursement
Obligations as contemplated by ss.4.2(b) and (c). Each payment of any Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligations or prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans shall be
allocated among the Revolving Credit Lenders, in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to each Reimbursement Obligation or (as the case may be) the
respective unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving
Credit Note, with adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior
payments or repayments not exactly in proportion.

2.6. OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. The Borrowers shall have the
right, at their election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans, as a whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium,
PROVIDED that any full or partial prepayment of the outstanding amount of any
Eurodollar Rate Loans pursuant to this ss.2.6 may be made only on the last day
of the Interest Period relating thereto. Except for repayments of the Revolving
Credit Loans as contemplated by ss.2.14 the Borrowers' Representative shall give
the Administrative Agent, no later than 12:00 noon, Boston time, at least one
(1) Business Day prior written notice of any proposed prepayment pursuant to
this ss.2.6 of Base Rate Loans, and three (3) Eurodollar Business Days notice of
any proposed prepayment pursuant to this ss.2.6 of Eurodollar Rate Loans, in
each case, specifying the proposed date of prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans
and the principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial prepayment of the



                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, shall be accompanied by the payment of
accrued interest on the principal prepaid to the date of prepayment and shall be
applied, in the absence of instruction by the Borrowers' Representative, first
to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to the principal of Eurodollar Rate
Loans. Each partial prepayment shall be allocated among the Lenders, in
proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amount
of each Lender's Revolving Credit Note, with adjustments to the extent
practicable to equalize any prior repayments not exactly in proportion.

2.7.  THE LOAN ACCOUNT AND REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES.

2.7.1.   LOAN ACCOUNT. An account ("LOAN ACCOUNT") shall be opened on the books
         of the Administrative Agent in which a record shall be kept of all
         Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also keep a
         record (either in the Loan Account or elsewhere, as the Administrative
         Agent may from time to time elect) (such record the "REGISTER") of the
         name and addresses of the Revolving Credit Lenders, the Commitment
         Percentage of the Revolving Credit Lenders, all interest, fees, service
         charges, costs, expenses, and other debits owed to the Administrative
         Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender on account of the Obligations
         and of all credits against such amounts so owed. The Borrowers
         irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to make or cause to be
         made, at or about the time of the Drawdown Date of any Revolving Credit
         Loan or at the time of receipt of any payment of principal on the Loan
         Account, an appropriate notation on the Loan Account reflecting the
         making of such Revolving Credit Loan or (as the case may be) the
         receipt of such payment, but the failure to record, or any error in so
         recording, any such amount on the Loan Account shall not limit or
         otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or under
         any Revolving Credit Loan to make payments of principal of or interest
         on any Revolving Credit Loan when due. The Borrowers jointly and
         severally promise to pay all of the Obligations in accordance with the
         provisions of this Agreement. All credits against the Obligations shall
         be conditional upon final payment to the Administrative Agent for the
         account of each Revolving Credit Lender of the items giving rise to
         such credits. The amount of any item credited against the Obligations
         due to the Revolving Credit Lenders which is charged back against the
         Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender for any reason or
         is not so paid shall be an Obligation and shall be added to the Loan
         Account, whether or not the item so charged back or not so paid is
         returned. Any statement rendered by the Administrative Agent to the
         Borrowers concerning the Obligations shall be considered correct and
         accepted (absent manifest error) by the Borrowers and shall be
         conclusively binding upon the Borrowers unless the Borrowers'
         Representative provides the Administrative Agent with written objection
         thereto within thirty (30) days from the mailing of such statement,
         which written objection shall indicate, with reasonable particularity,
         the reason for such objection. The Loan Account, the Register and the
         Administrative Agent's books and records concerning the loan
         arrangement contemplated herein and the Obligations shall be prima
         facie evidence and proof of the items described therein. The Loan
         Account and Register shall be available for inspection by the
         Borrowers' Representative and the Revolving Credit Lenders at any
         reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

2.7.2.   REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES. At the request of any Revolving Credit Lender
         the Borrowers shall deliver to such Revolving Credit Lender separate
         promissory notes of the Borrowers in substantially the form of EXHIBIT
         B hereto (each a "REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE"), dated as of the Closing Date



                                      -27-
<PAGE>

         (or such other date on which a Revolving Credit Lender may become a
         party hereto in accordance with ss.15 hereof) and completed with
         appropriate insertions. Each Revolving Credit Note shall be payable to
         the order of such Revolving Credit Lender in a principal amount equal
         to such Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment or, if less, the
         outstanding amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such Revolving
         Credit Lender, plus interest accrued thereon, as set forth below. No
         Revolving Credit Note shall be required to establish or prove any
         Obligation. In the event that any Revolving Credit Note is ever lost,
         mutilated, or destroyed, the Borrowers shall execute a replacement
         thereof and deliver such replacement to the Administrative Agent;
         PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in the event that a Revolving Credit Note is to be
         exchanged following its acceleration or the entry of an order for
         relief under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrowers, the
         Administrative Agent, in lieu of causing the Borrowers to execute one
         or more new Revolving Credit Notes, may issue the Agent's Certificate
         confirming the resulting Lender's Commitment and Percentage
         Commitments.

2.8.  INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

2.8.1.  ACCRUAL OF INTEREST.  Except as otherwise provided in ss.5.10,

                           (a) Each Revolving Credit Loan which is a Base Rate
                  Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with the
                  Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the
                  Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum
                  equal to the Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Margin with respect
                  to Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

                           (b) Each Revolving Credit Loan which is a Eurodollar
                  Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period commencing with
                  the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the
                  Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum
                  equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest
                  Period PLUS the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurodollar
                  Rate Loans as in effect from time to time.

                           The Borrowers jointly and severally promise to pay
                  interest on each Revolving Credit Loan in arrears on each
                  Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

2.8.2.   AUTOMATIC DEBIT OF INTEREST. The Administrative Agent, without the
         request of the Borrowers, may make Revolving Credit Loans to pay any
         interest, fee, service charge, or other payment to which the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender is entitled from the Borrowers
         pursuant hereto and may charge the same to the Loan Account
         notwithstanding that an OverLoan may result thereby. Such action on the
         part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the
         Administrative Agent's rights and the Borrowers' obligations under
         ss.13. Any amount which is added to the principal balance of the Loan
         Account as provided in this ss.2.8.2 shall bear interest at the
         interest rate then and thereafter applicable to Base Rate Loans.

2.9.  REQUESTS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

2.9.1.   GENERAL. The Borrowers' Representative shall give to the Administrative
         Agent written notice in the form of EXHIBIT C hereto (or telephonic
         notice confirmed in a writing in the form of EXHIBIT C hereto) of each
         Revolving Credit Loan requested hereunder (a "LOAN REQUEST") no later
         than (a) 12:00 noon on the Business Day of the proposed Drawdown Date
         of any Base Rate Loan and (b) 1:00 p.m. three (3) Eurodollar Business
         Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any Eurodollar Rate Loan.
         Each such notice shall specify (i) the principal amount of the
         Revolving Credit Loan requested, (ii) the proposed Drawdown Date of



                                      -28-
<PAGE>

         such Revolving Credit Loan, (iii) the Interest Period for such
         Revolving Credit Loan and (iv) the Type of such Revolving Credit Loan.
         Promptly upon receipt of any such notice, but in any event no later
         than [2:00PM] on the proposed Drawdown Date, the Administrative Agent
         shall notify each of the Revolving Credit Lenders thereof. Each Loan
         Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers and shall
         obligate the Borrowers to accept the Revolving Credit Loan requested
         from the Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request shall
         be in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple
         of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

2.9.2.   SWING LINE. Notwithstanding the notice and minimum amount requirements
         set forth in ss.2.9.1 but otherwise in accordance with the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement (except with respect to Protective
         OverAdvances), the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion and
         without conferring with the Lenders, make Revolving Credit Loans to the
         Borrowers (a) by entry of credits to the Borrowers' operating account
         or such other account (the "OPERATING ACCOUNT") with the Administrative
         Agent to cover checks or other charges which the Borrowers have drawn
         or made against such account, (b) in an amount as otherwise requested
         by the Borrowers or (c) as Protective OverAdvances. The Borrowers
         hereby request and authorize the Administrative Agent to make from time
         to time such Revolving Credit Loans by means of appropriate entries of
         such credits sufficient to cover checks and other charges then
         presented for payment from the Operating Account or as otherwise so
         requested. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that the making of such
         Revolving Credit Loans shall, in each case, be subject in all respects
         to the provisions of this Agreement as if they were Revolving Credit
         Loans covered by a Loan Request including, without limitation, the
         limitations set forth in ss.2.1 and the requirements that the
         applicable provisions of ss.11 (in the case of Revolving Credit Loans
         made on the Closing Date) and ss.12 be satisfied (except in the case of
         Protective OverAdvances). All actions taken by the Administrative Agent
         pursuant to the provisions of this ss.2.9.2 shall be conclusive and
         binding on the Borrowers and the Revolving Credit Lenders absent the
         Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
         Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to this ss.2.9.2 shall be Base
         Rate Loans until converted in accordance with the provisions of the
         Agreement and, prior to a Settlement, such interest shall be for the
         account of the Administrative Agent.

2.10.  CONVERSION OPTIONS.

2.10.1.  CONVERSION TO DIFFERENT TYPE OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN. The Borrowers'
         Representative may elect from time to time to convert any outstanding
         Revolving Credit Loan to a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type,
         PROVIDED that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurodollar
         Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan, the Borrowers' Representative shall give
         the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Days prior written
         notice of such election; (b) with respect to any such conversion of a
         Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrowers' Representative
         shall give the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Eurodollar
         Business Days prior written notice of such election; (c) with respect
         to any such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan,
         such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest
         Period with respect thereto and (d) no Revolving Credit Loan may be
         converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan when any Default has occurred and
         is continuing. On the date on which such conversion is being made each



                                      -29-
<PAGE>

         Revolving Credit Lender shall take such action as is necessary to
         transfer its Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans to
         its Domestic Lending Office or its Eurodollar Lending Office, as the
         case may be. All or any part of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of
         any Type may be converted into a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type
         as provided herein, PROVIDED that any partial conversion shall be in an
         aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of
         $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Conversion Request relating to the
         conversion of a Revolving Credit Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall
         be irrevocable by the Borrowers.

2.10.2.  CONTINUATION OF TYPE OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN. Any Revolving Credit
         Loan of any Type may be continued as a Revolving Credit Loan of the
         same Type upon the expiration of an Interest Period with respect
         thereto by compliance by the Borrowers with the notice provisions
         contained in ss.2.10.1; PROVIDED that no Eurodollar Rate Loan may be
         continued as such when any Default has occurred and is continuing, but
         shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of
         the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the
         continuance of any Default of which officers of the Administrative
         Agent active upon the Borrowers' account have actual knowledge. In the
         event that the Borrowers fail to provide any such notice with respect
         to the continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan as such, then such
         Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate
         Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto. The
         Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly when any such
         automatic conversion contemplated by this ss.2.10.2 is scheduled to
         occur.

2.10.3.  EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS. Any conversion to or from Eurodollar Rate Loans
         shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so
         that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of
         all Eurodollar Rate Loans having the same Interest Period shall not be
         less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
         thereof. No more than 5 Eurodollar Rate Loans having different Interest
         Periods may be outstanding at any time.

2.11.  FUNDS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN.

2.11.1.  FUNDING PROCEDURES. Not later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the
         proposed Drawdown Date of any Revolving Credit Loans, each of the
         Revolving Credit Lenders will make available to the Administrative
         Agent, at the Administrative Agent's Office, in immediately available
         funds, the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment
         Percentage of the amount of the requested Revolving Credit Loans. Upon
         receipt from each Revolving Credit Lender of such amount, and upon
         receipt of the documents required by ss.ss.11 and 12 and the
         satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to the extent
         applicable, the Administrative Agent will make available to the
         Borrowers' Representative the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit
         Loans made available to the Administrative Agent by the Revolving
         Credit Lenders. The failure or refusal of any Revolving Credit Lender
         to make available to the Administrative Agent at the aforesaid time and
         place on any Drawdown Date the amount of its Commitment Percentage of
         the requested Revolving Credit Loans shall not relieve any other
         Revolving Credit Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make
         available to the Administrative Agent the amount of such other
         Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment Percentage of any requested
         Revolving Credit Loans.

2.11.2.  ADVANCES BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may, unless
         notified to the contrary by any Revolving Credit Lender prior to a
         Drawdown Date, assume that such Revolving Credit Lender has made



                                      -30-
<PAGE>

         available to the Administrative Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount
         of such Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment Percentage of the
         Revolving Credit Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date, and the
         Administrative Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance
         upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding
         amount. If any Revolving Credit Lender makes available to the
         Administrative Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date,
         such Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on
         demand all such costs and expenses as may be incurred by the
         Administrative Agent in the enforcement of the Administrative Agent's
         rights against such Revolving Credit Lender plus an amount equal to the
         greater of (a) the amount of interest actually paid by the Borrowers on
         account of such amounts or (b) the product of (i) the average computed
         for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the weighted
         average interest rate paid by the Administrative Agent for federal
         funds acquired by the Administrative Agent during each day included in
         such period, TIMES (ii) the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender's
         Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans, TIMES (iii) a
         fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from
         and including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the amount of
         such Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Revolving
         Credit Loans shall become immediately available to the Administrative
         Agent, and the denominator of which is 360. A statement of the
         Administrative Agent submitted to such Revolving Credit Lender with
         respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be PRIMA FACIE
         evidence of the amount due and owing to the Revolving Credit
         Administrative Agent by such Revolving Credit Lender. If the amount of
         such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loans is
         not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Revolving Credit
         Lender within three (3) Business Days following such Drawdown Date, the
         Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from the
         Borrowers on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum
         applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans made on such Drawdown Date.

2.11.3.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. There shall not be any recourse to or
         liability of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, on account of: (a)
         any delay in the making of any Revolving Credit Loan, (b) any delay by
         any bank or other depository institution in treating the proceeds of
         any such Revolving Credit Loan as collected funds or (c) any delay in
         the receipt, and/or any loss, of funds which constitute a Revolving
         Credit Loan, the wire transfer of which was properly initiated by the
         Administrative Agent in accordance with wire instructions provided to
         the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers.

2.12.   BORROWING BASE/REDUCTIONS TO AVAILABILITY.

2.12.1.  CHANGE IN BORROWING BASE. The Borrowing Base shall be determined weekly
         (or at such other interval as may be specified pursuant to ss.8.4(f))
         by the Administrative Agent by reference to the Borrowing Base Report,
         commercial finance and collateral audit reports, and the appraisals of
         Eligible Fixed Assets, Inventory and Private Label Accounts delivered
         to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent pursuant to ss.8.4(h) and
         other information obtained by or provided to the Administrative Agent.
         Without in any way limiting the Administrative Agent's right to modify
         them at any time in the future, as of the Closing Date the current
         Reserves are as set forth on SCHEDULE 2.12.1 hereto. In determining
         whether to reduce the lending formula(s), the Administrative Agent may
         consider events, conditions, contingencies or risks which are also



                                      -31-
<PAGE>

         considered in determining Eligible Accounts Receivable, Eligible
         Inventory or in establishing the Reserves; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
         reduction lending formula shall not be based upon any event, condition,
         contingency or risk to the extent that a Reserve has been established.
         The Administrative Agent shall give to the Borrowers' Representative
         five (5) days written notice of its determination of the actual
         Borrowing Base and Availability taking into account such Reserves as
         the Administrative Agent may reasonably determine as being applicable
         thereto and shall have discussed its basis for such determination with
         the Borrowers' Representative if the Borrowers' Representative shall so
         request.

2.12.2.  RISK OF VALUE OF COLLATERAL. The Administrative Agent's reference to a
         given asset in connection with the making of Loans and advances and the
         providing of financial accommodations under this Agreement and/or the
         monitoring of compliance with the provisions hereof shall not be deemed
         a determination by the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to
         the actual value of the asset in question. All risks concerning the
         value of the Collateral are and remain upon the Borrowers. All
         Collateral secures the prompt, punctual, and faithful performance of
         the Obligations whether or not relied upon by the Administrative Agent
         in connection with the making of Loans, credits, and advances and the
         providing of financial accommodations under this Agreement.

2.12.3.  REDUCTIONS TO AVAILABILITY. In the determination of Availability, the
         Administrative Agent may deem fees, service charges, accrued interest,
         and other payments which will be due and payable between the date of
         such determination and the first day of the then next succeeding month
         as having been advanced as Revolving Credit Loans whether or not such
         amounts are then due and payable.

2.13.  SETTLEMENTS.

2.13.1.  GENERAL. On each Settlement Date, the Administrative Agent shall, not
         later than 12:00 noon (Boston time), give telephonic or facsimile
         notice (a) to the Revolving Credit Lenders and the Borrowers of the
         respective outstanding amount of Revolving Credit Loans made by the
         Administrative Agent on behalf of the Revolving Credit Lenders from the
         immediately preceding Settlement Date through the close of business on
         the prior day and the amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made
         (following the giving of notice pursuant to ss.2.9.1) on such date
         pursuant to a Loan Request and (b) to the Revolving Credit Lenders of
         the amount (a "SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") that each Revolving Credit Lender (a
         "SETTLING LENDER") shall pay to effect a Settlement of any Revolving
         Credit Loan. A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to the
         Revolving Credit Lenders and the Borrowers or to the Revolving Credit
         Lenders with respect to any amounts owing under this ss.2.13.1 shall be
         PRIMA FACIE evidence of the amount due and owing (absent manifest
         error). Each Settling Lender shall, not later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston
         time) on such Settlement Date, effect a wire transfer of immediately
         available funds to the Administrative Agent in the amount of the
         Settlement Amount for such Settling Lender. All funds advanced by any
         Lender as a Settling Lender pursuant to this ss.2.13.1 shall for all
         purposes be treated as a Revolving Credit Loan made by such Settling
         Lender to the Borrowers and all funds received by any Revolving Credit
         Lender pursuant to this ss.2.13.1 shall for all purposes be treated as
         repayment of amounts owed with respect to Revolving Credit Loans made
         by such Revolving Credit Lender. In the event that any bankruptcy,
         reorganization, liquidation, receivership or similar cases or



                                      -32-
<PAGE>

         proceedings in which any Borrower is a debtor prevent a Settling Lender
         from making any Revolving Credit Loan to effect a Settlement as
         contemplated hereby, such Settling Lender will make such dispositions
         and arrangements with the other Revolving Credit Lenders with respect
         to such Revolving Credit Loans, either by way of purchase of
         participations, distribution, PRO TANTO assignment of claims,
         subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Revolving Credit
         Lender's share of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans being equal,
         as nearly as may be, to such Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment
         Percentage of the outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans.

2.13.2.  FAILURE TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE. The Administrative Agent may, unless
         notified to the contrary by any Settling Lender prior to a Settlement
         Date, assume that such Settling Lender has made or will make available
         to the Administrative Agent on such Settlement Date the amount of such
         Settling Lender's Settlement Amount, and the Administrative Agent may
         (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption,
         make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. If any Settling
         Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent such amount on a
         date after such Settlement Date, such Settling Lender shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (a)
         the average computed for the period referred to in clause (c) below, of
         the weighted average interest rate paid by the Administrative Agent for
         federal funds acquired by the Administrative Agent during each day
         included in such period, times (b) the amount of such Settlement
         Amount, times (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
         days that elapse from and including such Settlement Date to the date on
         which the amount of such Settlement Amount shall become immediately
         available to the Administrative Agent, and the denominator of which is
         360. A statement of the Administrative Agent submitted to such Settling
         Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this ss.2.13.2 shall be
         prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Administrative
         Agent by such Settling Lender (absent manifest error). If such Settling
         Lender's Settlement Amount is not made available to the Administrative
         Agent by such Settling Lender within three (3) Business Days following
         such Settlement Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
         recover such amount from the Borrowers on demand, with interest thereon
         at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans as of
         such Settlement Date.

2.13.3.  NO EFFECT ON OTHER LENDERS. The failure or refusal of any Settling
         Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent at the aforesaid
         time and place on any Settlement Date the amount of such Settling
         Lender's Settlement Amount shall not (a) relieve any other Settling
         Lender from its several obligations hereunder to make available to the
         Administrative Agent the amount of such other Settling Lender's
         Settlement Amount or (b) impose upon any Lender, other than the
         Settling Lender so failing or refusing, any liability with respect to
         such failure or refusal or otherwise increase the Commitment of such
         other Lender.

2.14.  REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS ABSENT AN EVENT OF DEFAULT.

2.14.1.  CREDIT FOR FUNDS RECEIVED IN CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT. (a) All funds and
         cash proceeds in the form of money, checks and like items received in
         the Fleet Concentration Account as contemplated by ss.8.14 shall be
         credited, on the next Business Day on which the Administrative Agent
         determines that good collected funds have been received, and, prior to
         the receipt of good collected funds, on a provisional basis until final
         receipt of good collected funds, and applied as contemplated by
         ss.2.14.2, or as applicable, ss.13.4, (b) all funds and cash proceeds
         in the form of a wire transfer received in the Fleet Concentration
         Account as contemplated by ss.8.14 shall be credited on the next
         Business Day as the Administrative Agent's receipt of such amounts (or



                                      -33-
<PAGE>

         up to such later date as the Administrative Agent determines that good
         collected funds have been received), and applied as contemplated by
         ss.2.14.2, or as applicable, ss.13.4, and (c) all funds and cash
         proceeds in the form of an automated clearing house transfer received
         in the Fleet Concentration Account as contemplated by ss.8.14 shall be
         credited, on the next Business Day following the Administrative Agent's
         receipt of such amounts (or up to such later date as the Administrative
         Agent determines that good collected funds have been received), and
         applied as contemplated by ss.2.14.2, or as applicable, ss.13.4. For
         purposes of the foregoing provisions of this ss.2.14.1, the
         Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have received any such
         funds or cash proceeds on any day unless received by the Administrative
         Agent before 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on such day. The Borrowers further
         acknowledge and agree that any such provisional credits or credits in
         respect of wire or automatic clearing house funds transfers shall be
         subject to reversal if final collection in good funds of the related
         item is not received by, or final settlement of the funds transfer is
         not made in favor of, the Administrative Agent in accordance with the
         Administrative Agent's customary procedures and practices for
         collecting provisional items or receiving settlement of funds
         transfers. No Revolving Credit Lender shall have any interest in, or
         right to receive any part of any interest which reflects amounts
         described in the provisions of this Section 2.14.1.

2.14.2.  APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS ABSENT AN EVENT OF DEFAULT.

                           (a) Absent an Event of Default of which the account
                  officers of the Administrative Agent active on the Borrowers'
                  account have knowledge, all funds transferred to the Fleet
                  Concentration Account and for which the Borrowers have
                  received credits shall be applied to the Obligations as
                  follows:

                                    (i) first, to pay amounts then due and
                           payable under this Agreement, the Notes and the other
                           Loan Documents;

                                    (ii) second, to reduce Swing Line Loans made
                           by the Administrative Agent and for which Settlement
                           has not then been made;

                                    (iii) third, to reduce other Revolving
                           Credit Loans which are Base Rate Loans;

                                    (iv) fourth, to reduce Revolving Credit
                           Loans which are Eurodollar Rate Loans; and

                                    (v) fifth, except as otherwise required
                           by ss.2.14.2(b) and (c), to the Operating Account.

                           (b) All prepayments of Eurodollar Rate Loans prior to
                  the end of an Interest Period shall obligate the Borrowers to
                  pay any breakage costs associated with such Eurodollar Rate
                  Loans in accordance with ss.5.9. Prior to the occurrence of an
                  Event of Default, the Borrowers may elect to avoid such
                  breakage costs by providing to the Administrative Agent cash
                  in an amount sufficient to cash collateralize such Eurodollar
                  Rate Loans, but in no event shall the Borrowers be deemed to
                  have paid such Eurodollar Rate Loans until such cash has been
                  paid to the Administrative Agent for application to such



                                      -34-
<PAGE>

                  Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent may elect to
                  cause such cash collateral to be deposited into a cash
                  collateral account pursuant to the terms of a cash collateral
                  agreement executed by the Borrowers and the Administrative
                  Agent and in form and substance satisfactory to the
                  Administrative Agent. In each such case, the Borrowers agree
                  to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such
                  instruments and documents, including Uniform Commercial Code
                  financing statements and agreements with any third party
                  depository banks, as the Administrative Agent may request.

                           (c) All prepayments of the Revolving Credit Loans
                  pursuant to this ss.2.14.2 shall be allocated among the
                  Revolving Credit Lenders making such Revolving Credit Loans,
                  in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective
                  unpaid principal amount of such Revolving Credit Loans
                  outstanding, with adjustments to the extent practicable to
                  equalize any prior payments or repayments not exactly in
                  proportion. Prior to any Settlement Date, however, all
                  prepayments of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied in
                  accordance with this ss.2.14.2, first to outstanding Revolving
                  Credit Loans of the Administrative Agent.

2.15. REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. Following the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default of which the
account officers of the Administrative Agent active on the Borrower's account
have knowledge, all funds transferred to the Fleet Concentration Account and for
which the Borrowers have received credits shall be applied to the Obligations in
accordance with ss.13.4.

2.16. OVERLOANS AND PROTECTIVE OVERADVANCES.

2.16.1.  PROTECTIVE OVERADVANCES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION CONTAINED IN
         THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY (WITHOUT
         ANY OBLIGATION TO DO SO) IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION MAKE
         PROTECTIVE OVERADVANCES TO THE BORROWERS WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE
         OVERLOANS.


2.16.2.  OVERLOANS. Each Revolving Credit Lender recognizes that subsequent to
         the making of a Revolving Credit Loan which does not constitute a
         Protective OverAdvance, Availability may be less than $0 on account of
         changed circumstances beyond the control of the Administrative Agent
         (such as a drop in collateral value).

2.16.3.  NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE OVERLOANS. The Administrative Agent's and the
         Revolving Credit Lenders' providing of an OverLoan or Protective
         OverAdvance on any one occasion does not affect the obligations of the
         Borrowers hereunder (including the Borrowers' obligation to immediately
         repay any amount which otherwise constitutes an OverLoan) nor obligate
         the Revolving Credit Lenders or the Administrative Agent to do so on
         any other occasion.

                           3. THE TRANCHE B FACILITY.

3.1. COMMITMENT TO LEND. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Tranche B Lender agrees to lend to the Borrowers on the Closing
Date the principal amount of $12,500,000.

3.2. THE TRANCHE B LOAN NOTE. The Tranche B Loan shall be evidenced by a
separate promissory note of the Borrowers in substantially the form of EXHIBIT C
hereto (the "TRANCHE B NOTE"), dated the Closing Date, and completed with
appropriate insertions. The Borrowers irrevocably authorize the Tranche B Lender
to make or cause to be made a notation on the Tranche B Lender's records
reflecting the original principal amount of the Tranche B Loan and, at or about
the time of the Tranche B Lender's receipt of any principal payment on the
Tranche B Loan Note, an appropriate notation on the Tranche B Lender's records
reflecting such payment. The aggregate unpaid amount set forth on the Tranche B



                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Lender's records shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the principal amount thereof
owed and unpaid on the Tranche B Loan, but the failure to record, or any error
in so recording, any such amount on the Tranche B Lender's records shall not
affect the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or under the Tranche B Loan
Note to make payments of principal of and interest on the Tranche B Loan Note
when due.

3.3. PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL OF TRANCHE B LOAN. Except as contemplated by ss.13.4,
the Borrowers may not make any principal payments on account of the Tranche B
Loan until the Borrowers' Obligations to the Revolving Credit Lenders have been
paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the
Borrowers may prepay the Tranche B Loan in its entirety if at such time (i) a
Default does not exist and one would not result from such prepayment, (ii) after
giving effect to such payment Availability is in excess of $10,000,00 and (iii)
the Borrowers shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent pro forma
financial statements for the next 12 months demonstrating, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that Availability will exceed
$10,000,000 at all times during the next 12 months after giving effect to the
prepayment of the Tranche B Loan. The Borrowers jointly and severally promise to
pay on the Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on
the Maturity Date, all of the Tranche B Loans outstanding on such date, together
with any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If the Borrowers prepay
the Tranche B Loans in whole or in part, the Borrowers shall pay a premium with
respect to each such prepayment (the "TRANCHE B EARLY TERMINATION FEE") in an
amount determined in accordance with the percentages set forth in the following
table opposite the period during which such prepayment is made:

3.4. INTEREST ON TRANCHE B LOAN. Except as otherwise provided in ss.ss.3.4(c)
and 16.12(c)(iv), the outstanding amount of the Tranche B Loan shall be



                                      -36-
<PAGE>

calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days
elapsed and shall bear interest until repaid at the rate per annum equal to
sixteen and one half percent (16.5%) prior to an Approved Recapitalization and
sixteen percent (16.0%) following an Approved Recapitalization (the "TRANCHE B
LOAN INTEREST RATE"). The Tranche B Loan Interest Rate, shall be payable as
follows:

         (a)      Accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance of the
                  Tranche B Loan at a rate per annum equal to thirteen and three
                  quarter percent (13.75%) prior to an Approved Recapitalization
                  and thirteen and one half percent (13.50%) following an
                  Approved Recapitalization ("TRANCHE B LOAN CURRENT PAY
                  INTEREST") shall be payable monthly in arrears, on the first
                  Business Day of each month (the "TRANCHE B LOAN INTEREST
                  PAYMENT DATE"), and on the Maturity Date.

         (b)      Accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance of the
                  Tranche B Loan in excess of Tranche B Loan Current Pay
                  Interest (which excess is referred to herein as "TRANCHE B
                  LOAN PIK INTEREST") shall be payable as follows:

                           (i)      Unless the payment would cause an OverLoan
                                    or the Tranche B Lender has been given
                                    written notice by the Borrowers'
                                    Representative at least three (3) Business
                                    Days prior to the relevant Tranche B Loan
                                    Interest Payment Date that the Borrowers are
                                    exercising their option to pay interest in
                                    kind (the "PIK ELECTION"), the Tranche B
                                    Loan PIK Interest will be due on such date
                                    in cash.

                           (ii)     If the Tranche B Lender has received a PIK
                                    Election or the payment would cause an
                                    OverLoan, all or any part of Tranche B Loan
                                    PIK Interest shall be paid by adding the
                                    same to the principal balance of the Tranche
                                    B Loan Note on that Tranche B Loan Interest
                                    Payment Date.

                           (iii)    At the direction of the Tranche B Lender,
                                    following the occurrence of any Default, all
                                    interest shall be paid in cash on each
                                    Tranche B Loan Interest Payment Date.

                  (c)      Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, at
                           the direction of the Tranche B Loan Lender, interest
                           shall accrue and shall be payable on the unpaid
                           principal balance of the Tranche B Loan at the
                           aggregate of the Tranche B Loan Interest Rate plus
                           three percent (3%) per annum.

3.5. TRANCHE B LOAN ANNIVERSARY FEE. Until the Tranche B Loan has been paid in
full, on each anniversary of the Closing Date the Borrowers shall pay an
anniversary fee to the Tranche B Lender as set forth in the Tranche B Fee
Letter.

3.6. PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF TRANCHE B LOAN. The Borrowers authorize the
Administrative Agent to determine and to pay over directly to the Tranche B
Lender any and all amounts due and payable from time to time under or on account
of the Tranche B Loan as advances under the Revolving Credit Loans IT BEING
UNDERSTOOD, HOWEVER, that the authorization of the Administrative Agent provided
in this ss. 3.6 shall not excuse the Borrowers from fulfilling their obligations
to the Tranche B Lender on account of the Tranche B Loan nor place any
obligation on the Administrative Agent to do so. The Administrative Agent shall



                                      -37-
<PAGE>

provide prompt advice to the Borrowers of any amount which is so paid over by
the Administrative Agent to the Tranche B Lender pursuant to this ss.3.6. The
Borrowers shall not be entitled to any credit, rebate or repayment of any fee or
assessment previously earned by the Tranche B Lender pursuant to this Agreement
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or suspension or termination
of the Administrative Agent's and any Lender's respective obligation to make
loans and advances hereunder.

3.7. BUYOUT OPTION. At any time during any Buyout Exercise Period the Tranche B
Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) give notice to the Administrative
Agent (the "Buyout Acceptance Notice") of its intent to cause the assignment to
the Tranche B Lender, or its designee, by the Revolving Credit Lenders, of all
right, title and interest in, to, arising under or in respect of all Obligations
of the Revolving Credit Lenders. Such assignments shall be effected on the
Business Day which is not more than three (3) Business Days following the Buyout
Acceptance Notice by the execution, by the Revolving Credit Lenders, of an
Assignment and Acceptance in exchange for the payment, in immediately available
funds, of the amount of the Obligations in respect of the Revolving Credit Loans
(excluding the Revolving Credit Early Termination Fee) as of the date on which
such assignment is made. The Tranche B Lender's buy out right under this ss.3.7
may only be exercised completely with respect to all of the Obligations of the
Revolving Credit Lenders. Following its exercise of the buy out right under this
ss.3.7, the Tranche B Lender shall (a) not waive or alter the Revolving Credit
Early Termination Fee or alter the payment provisions in ss.13.4 to change when
the Revolving Credit Early Termination Fee would be paid and (b) upon receipt of
any amounts on account of the Revolving Credit Early Termination Fee, pay such
amounts to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Credit
Lenders in accordance with their Commitment Percentages as of the date of the
buy out under this ss.3.7.

                              4. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

4.1.1.   COMMITMENT TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the terms and
         conditions hereof and the execution and delivery by the Borrowers'
         Representative of a letter of credit application on the Letter of
         Credit Issuer's customary form (a "LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATION"), the
         Borrowers' Representative may request that Administrative Agent cause
         the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue on behalf of the Revolving Credit
         Lenders and in reliance upon the agreement of the Revolving Credit
         Lenders set forth in ss.4.1.4 and upon the representations and

         "LETTER OF CREDIT"), in such form as may be requested from time to time
         by the Borrowers' Representative and agreed to by the Letter of Credit
         Issuer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, after giving effect to such request,

         Letter of Credit. There shall not be any recourse to, nor liability of,
         the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Letter of Credit Issuer on
         account of any delay or refusal by any Letter of Credit Issuer to issue
         a Letter of Credit.

                  4.1.2. LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATIONS. Each Letter of Credit
         Application shall be completed to the satisfaction of the
         Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer. In the event that

<PAGE>

         any provision of any Letter of Credit Application shall be inconsistent
         with any provision of this Agreement, then the provisions of this
         Agreement shall, to the extent of any such inconsistency, govern.

4.1.3.   TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit issued, extended or
         renewed hereunder shall, among other things, (a) provide for the
         payment of sight drafts for honor thereunder when presented in
         accordance with the terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents
         described therein, and (b) have an expiry date no later than the
         earlier of (i) the date which is fourteen (14) days (or, if the Letter

         more nominated persons, forty-five (45) days) prior to the Maturity
         Date and (ii) with respect to (A) standby Letters of Credit one (1)
         year after the date of issuance and (B) documentary Letters of Credit
         sixty (60) after the date of issuance . Each Letter of Credit so
         issued, extended or renewed shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and
         Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber
         of Commerce Publication No. 500 or any successor version thereto
         adopted by the Letter of Credit Issuer in the ordinary course of its
         business as a letter of credit issuer and in effect at the time of
         issuance of such Letter of Credit (the "UNIFORM CUSTOMS") or, in the
         case of a standby Letter of Credit, either the Uniform Customs or the
         International Standby Practices (ISP98), International Chamber of
         Commerce Publication No. 590, or any successor code of standby letter
         of credit practices among banks adopted by the Letter of Credit Issuer
         in the ordinary course of its business as a standby letter of credit
         issuer and in effect at the time of issuance of such Letter of Credit.

4.1.4.   REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LENDERS. Each Revolving
         Credit Lender severally agrees that it shall be absolutely liable,
         without regard to whether a Default exists or any other condition
         precedent whatsoever, to the extent of such Revolving Credit Lender's
         Commitment Percentage, to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer and/or
         the Administrative Agent on demand for the amount of each draft paid by
         the Letter of Credit Issuer under each Letter of Credit to the extent
         that such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to ss.4.2
         (such agreement for a Lender being called herein the "LETTER OF CREDIT
         PARTICIPATION" of such Revolving Credit Lender).

4.1.5.   PARTICIPATIONS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LENDERS. Each such payment made by a
         Revolving Credit Lender shall be treated as the purchase by such
         Revolving Credit Lender of a participating interest in the Borrowers'
         Reimbursement Obligation under ss.4.2 in an amount equal to such
         payment. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall share in accordance with
         its participating interest in any interest which accrues pursuant to
         ss.4.2.

4.2. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWERS. In order to induce the
Administrative Agent to cause the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue, extend and
renew each Letter of Credit and the Revolving Credit Lenders to participate
therein, the Borrowers hereby jointly and severally agree to reimburse or pay to
the Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer, for the account of the
Administrative Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer or (as the case may be) the
Revolving Credit Lenders, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued, extended
or renewed by the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder,

                  (a) except as otherwise expressly provided in ss.4.2(b) and
         (c), on each date that any draft presented under such Letter of Credit
         is honored by the Letter of Credit Issuer, or the Letter of Credit
         Issuer otherwise makes a payment with respect thereto, (i) the amount
         paid by the Letter of Credit Issuer under or with respect to such
         Letter of Credit, and (ii) the amount of any taxes, reasonable fees,
         charges or other costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by the Letter




                                      -39-
<PAGE>

         of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection
         with any payment made by the Letter of Credit Issuer, the
         Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender under, or with
         respect to, such Letter of Credit,

                  (b) upon the reduction (but not termination) of the Total
         Commitment to an amount less than the Maximum Drawing Amount, an amount
         equal to such difference, which amount shall be held by the
         Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuer,
         the Revolving Credit Lenders and the Administrative Agent as cash
         collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations, and

                  (c) upon the termination of the Total Commitment, or the
         acceleration of the Reimbursement Obligations with respect to all
         Letters of Credit in accordance with ss.13, an amount equal to the then
         Maximum Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit, which amount shall be
         held by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Letter of
         Credit Issuer, the Revolving Credit Lenders and the Administrative
         Agent as cash collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations.

         Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office in immediately available funds. Interest on any
and all amounts remaining unpaid by the Borrowers under this ss.4.2 at any time
from the date such amounts become due and payable (whether as stated in this
ss.4.2, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full (whether before or
after judgment) shall be payable to the Administrative Agent on demand at the
rate specified in ss.5.10 for overdue principal on the Revolving Credit Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, without the request of
the Borrowers, may advance Revolving Credit Loans in the amount of any honoring
of any Letter of Credit and other amount for which the Borrowers, the Letter of
Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or the Revolving Credit Lenders become
obligated on account of, or in respect to, any Letter of Credit. Such advance
shall be made whether or not a Default exists or such advance would result in an
OverLoan. Such action shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative
Agent's and the Revolving Credit Lenders' rights under this Section 4.

4.3. LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS. If any draft shall be presented or other demand
for payment shall be made under any Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit
Issuer shall notify the Borrowers' Representative of the date and amount of the
draft presented or demand for payment and of the date and time when it expects
to pay such draft or honor such demand for payment. If the Borrowers'
Representative fails to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Administrative Agent as provided in ss.4.2 on or before the date that such draft
is paid or other payment is made by the Letter of Credit Issuer, the
Administrative Agent may at any time thereafter notify the Revolving Credit
Lenders of the amount of any such Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation. No later than
3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the Business Day next following the receipt of such
notice, each Revolving Credit Lender shall make available to the Letter of
Credit Issuer in immediately available funds, such Revolving Credit Lender's
Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, together with an
amount equal to the product of (a) the average, computed for the period referred



                                      -40-
<PAGE>


to in clause (c) below, of the weighted average interest rate paid by the Letter
of Credit Issuer for federal funds acquired by the Letter of Credit Issuer
during each day included in such period, TIMES (b) the amount equal to such
Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligation, TIMES (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
that elapse from and including the date the Letter of Credit Issuer paid the
draft presented for honor or otherwise made payment to the date on which such
Revolving Credit Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligation shall become immediately available to the Letter of Credit Issuer,
and the denominator of which is 360. The responsibility of the Administrative
Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer to the Borrowers and the Revolving Credit
Lenders shall be only to determine that the documents (including each draft)
delivered under each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall
be in conformity in all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

4.4. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrowers' obligations under this ss.4 shall be
absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of
whether a Default exists or any condition precedent whatsoever or any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrowers may have or have had
against the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Revolving
Credit Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit. The Borrowers further
agree with the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent and the
Revolving Credit Lenders that the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative
Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the
Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under ss.4.2 shall not be affected by,
among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any
or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among
the Borrowers, the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any financing
institution or other party to which any Letter of Credit may be transferred or
any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrowers against the beneficiary of
any Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Letter of Credit Issuer, the
Administrative Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders shall not be liable for
any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery
of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of
Credit. The Borrowers agree that any action taken or omitted by the Letter of
Credit Issuer, the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender under or
in connection with each Letter of Credit and the related drafts and documents,
if done in good faith, shall be binding upon the Borrowers and shall not result
in any liability on the part of the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Administrative
Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender to the Borrowers.

4.5. RELIANCE BY ISSUER. To the extent not inconsistent with ss.4.4, the Letter
of Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying upon, any Letter of Credit, draft, writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other
document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal
counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Letter of
Credit Issuer or the Administrative Agent. The Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it
shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Revolving
Credit Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred
by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Letter of




                                      -41-
<PAGE>

Credit Issuer and the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected
in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with
a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and all future
holders of the Revolving Credit Notes or of a Letter of Credit Participation.
Unless otherwise agreed to, in the particular instance, the Borrowers hereby
authorize any Letter of Credit Issuer to select an advising bank, if any, select
a paying bank, if any and Select a negotiating bank.

4.6. LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. The Borrowers shall, on monthly in arrears on the
first day of each month and on the Maturity Date pay a fee (in each case, a
"LETTER OF CREDIT FEE") to the Administrative Agent (a) in respect of each
standby Letter of Credit an amount equal to two and one quarter percent (2.25%)
per annum of the face amount of such standby Letter of Credit for the accounts
of the Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment
Percentages and (b) in respect of each documentary Letter of Credit an amount
equal to two and one quarter percent (2.25%) points per annum of the face amount
of such documentary Letter of Credit shall be for the accounts of the Revolving
Credit Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages.
Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Letter of Credit Fees
shall be increased by 200 basis points per annum. In respect of each Letter of
Credit, the Borrowers shall also pay to the Letter of Credit Issuer for the
Letter of Credit Issuer's own account, at such other time or times as such
charges are customarily made by the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Letter of
Credit Issuer's customary issuance, amendment, negotiation or document
examination and other reasonable administrative fees as in effect from time to
time.

                         5. CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

5.1. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay
to the Administrative Agent, for the Administrative Agent's own account, the
fees as set forth in the FRFI Fee Letter (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES").

5.2. TRANCHE B LENDER FEES. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to
the Tranche B Lender, for the Tranche B Lender's own account, the fees as set
forth in the Tranche B Fee Letter (the "TRANCHE B LENDER FEES").

5.3. FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

5.3.1.   PAYMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. All payments of principal, interest,
         Reimbursement Obligations, Fees and any other amounts due hereunder or
         under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made on the due date
         thereof to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the respective
         accounts of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, at the
         Administrative Agent's Office or at such other place that the
         Administrative Agent may from time to time designate, in each case at
         or about 12:00 noon (Boston time or other local time at the place of
         payment) and in immediately available funds.

5.3.2.   NO OFFSET, ETC. All payments by the Borrowers hereunder and under any
         of the other Loan Documents shall be made without recoupment, setoff or
         counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes,
         levies, imposts, duties, charges, reasonable fees, deductions,
         withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any
         nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any
         political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein
         unless the Borrowers are compelled by law to make such deduction or
         withholding. If any such obligation is imposed upon the Borrowers with
         respect to any amount payable by it hereunder or under any of the other
         Loan Documents, the Borrowers will pay to the Administrative Agent, for
         the account of the Lenders or (as the case may be) the Administrative
         Agent, on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder or
         under such other Loan Document, such additional amount in Dollars as
         shall be necessary to enable the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to
         receive the same net amount which the Lenders or the Administrative
         Agent would have received on such due date had no such obligation been
         imposed upon the Borrowers. Where taxes, deductions or withholdings are
         imposed upon the Borrowers with respect to any amount payable by the
         Borrowers hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents as a
         result of characteristics of the Administrative Agent, a Lender or a



                                      -42-
<PAGE>

         Participant, no payment of additional amounts is required under this
         ss.5.3.2, in respect of such taxes, deductions or withholdings to the
         extent that such Administrative Agent, Lender or Participant (as the
         case may be) was subject to such taxes, deductions or withholdings
         under the law in effect at the time that it became an Administrative
         Agent, Lender or Participant or subsequently became subject to such
         taxes, deductions or withholdings other than as a result of a change in
         law or any actions of the Borrowers. In addition, no payment of
         additional amounts is required under this ss.5.3.2 in respect of taxes,
         deductions or withholdings to the extent that such taxes, deductions or
         withholdings are imposed as a result of a failure by the Administrative
         Agent, a Lender, a Participant or any person in the chain of payment
         between the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, Lender or
         Participant, as the case may be, to provide, in accordance with
         applicable procedures, properly completed and executed tax forms that
         they are legally permitted to provide. The Borrowers will deliver
         promptly to the Administrative Agent certificates or other valid
         vouchers reasonably available to them for all taxes or other charges
         deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Borrowers
         hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

5.4. COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on the Loans and of Fees shall
be based on a 360-day year and paid for the actual number of days elapsed.
Except as otherwise provided in the definition of the term "INTEREST PERIOD"
with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, whenever a payment hereunder or under any
of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the
due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
and interest shall accrue during such extension. The outstanding amount of the
Loans as reflected on the Revolving Credit Note Records and the Tranche B
Lenders records and from time to time shall be considered correct and binding on
the Borrowers unless within five (5) Business Days after receipt of any notice
by the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders of such outstanding amount,
the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall notify the Borrowers
Representative to the contrary.

5.5. INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE. In the event, prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period relating to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
Administrative Agent shall in good faith determine that (a) adequate and
reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate that would
otherwise determine the rate of interest to be applicable to any Eurodollar Rate
Loan during any Interest Period or (b) the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be
determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Revolving Credit Lenders of making or maintaining their Eurodollar
Rate Loans during such period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
notice of such determination (which shall be conclusive and binding on the
Borrowers and the Revolving Credit Lenders) to the Borrowers' Representative and
the Revolving Credit Lenders. In such event (i) any Loan Request or Conversion
Request with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be automatically withdrawn
and shall be deemed a request for Base Rate Loans, (ii) each Eurodollar Rate
Loan will automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest Period
relating thereto, become a Base Rate Loan, and (iii) the obligations of the
Revolving Credit Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until



                                      -43-
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent determines that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension no longer exist, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall so notify
the Borrowers' Representative and the Revolving Credit Lenders.

5.6. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any future law,
regulation, treaty or directive or the interpretation or application thereof
shall make it unlawful for any Revolving Credit Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Revolving Credit Lender shall forthwith give notice
of such circumstances to the Borrowers' Representative and the other Revolving
Credit Lenders and thereupon (a) the commitment of such Revolving Credit Lender
to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall forthwith be suspended and (b) such Revolving Credit Lender's
Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Rate Loans, if any, shall
be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the last day of each Interest
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or within such earlier period as
may be required by law. The Borrowers hereby agree promptly to pay the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Revolving Credit Lender, upon
demand by such Revolving Credit Lender, any additional amounts reasonably
necessary to compensate such Revolving Credit Lender for any costs incurred by
such Revolving Credit Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this
ss.5.6, including any interest or reasonable fees payable by such Revolving
Credit Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder.

5.7. ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any future applicable law, which expression, as
used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations thereunder and
interpretations thereof after the date hereof by any competent court or by any
governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to any Lender or the Administrative Agent by any central bank
or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of
law), shall:

                  (a) subject any Lender or the Administrative Agent to any tax,
         levy, impost, duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature
         with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any Letters
         of Credit, such Lender's Commitment or the Loans (other than taxes
         based upon or measured by the income or profits of such Lender or the
         Administrative Agent), or

                  (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for
         changes in taxes on income or profits or taxes referred to in the first
         sentence of ss.5.3.2, which shall be taken into account in the manner
         provided by ss.5.3.2) of payments to any Lender of the principal of or
         the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable to any Lender or
         the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
         Documents, or

                  (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the
         extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) any
         special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or
         other similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law)
         against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans
         by, or letters of credit issued by, or commitments of an office of any
         Lender, or

                  (d) impose on any Lender or the Administrative Agent any other
         conditions or requirements with respect to this Agreement, the other
         Loan Documents, any Letters of Credit, the Loans, such Lender's



                                      -44-
<PAGE>

         Commitment, or any class of loans, letters of credit or commitments of
         which any of the Loans or such Lender's Commitment forms a part, and
         the result of any of the foregoing is

                           (i) to increase the cost to any Lender of making,
                  funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of
                  the Loans or such Lender's Commitment or any Letter of Credit,
                  or

                           (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest,
                  Reimbursement Obligation or other amount payable to such
                  Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder on account of
                  such Lender's Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any of the
                  Loans, or

                           (iii) to require such Lender or the Administrative
                  Agent to make any payment or to forego any interest or
                  Reimbursement Obligation or other sum payable hereunder, the
                  amount of which payment or foregone interest or Reimbursement
                  Obligation or other sum is calculated by reference to the
                  gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by such
                  Lender or the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers
                  hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrowers will, upon demand made by such Lender
or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to
time and as often as the occasion therefor may arise, pay to such Lender or the
Administrative Agent such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate
such Lender or the Administrative Agent for such additional cost, reduction,
payment or foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum.

5.8. CERTIFICATE. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts payable
pursuant to ss.5.7 and a brief explanation of such amounts which are due,
submitted by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers'
Representative, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts
are due and owing.

5.9. INDEMNITY. The Borrowers agree to indemnify each Revolving Credit Lender
and to hold each Lender harmless from and against any loss, cost or expense or
other "breakage fees" (so-called) (including loss of anticipated profits) that
such Revolving Credit Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a)
default by the Borrowers in payment of the principal amount of or any interest
on any Eurodollar Rate Loans as and when due and payable, including any such
loss or expense arising from interest or reasonable fees payable by such
Revolving Credit Lender to banks of funds obtained by it in order to maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans, (b) default by the Borrowers in making a borrowing or
conversion after the Borrowers' Representative has given (or is deemed to have
given) a Loan Request or a Conversion Request relating thereto in accordance
with ss.2.9 or ss.2.10 or (c) the making of any payment of a Eurodollar Rate
Loan or the making of any conversion of any such Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a
day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect
thereto, including interest or reasonable fees payable by such Lender to lenders
of funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such Loans.

5.10. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. During the continuance of a Default (and whether
or not the Administrative Agent exercises the Administrative Agent's rights on
account thereof) the principal of the Revolving Credit Loans shall, at the
option of the Administrative Agent or at the instruction of the SuperMajority
Lenders, until such Default has been cured or remedied or such Default has been



                                      -45-
<PAGE>

waived by the Required Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to ss.16.12, bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) above the rate of
interest otherwise applicable to such Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to ss.2.8.

5.11. FEES NON-REFUNDABLE. The Borrowers shall not be entitled to any credit,
rebate or repayment of any fee earned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
pursuant to this Agreement or any Loan Document notwithstanding any termination
of this Agreement or suspension or termination of the Administrative Agent's and
any Lender's respective obligation to make loans and advances hereunder.

5.12.  CONCERNING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF THE BORROWERS.

                  (a) Each of the Borrowers is accepting joint and several
         liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodations to
         be provided by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
         Lenders under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and
         indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in consideration of the
         undertakings of each of the Borrowers to accept joint and several
         liability for the obligations of each of them.

                  (b) Each of the Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby
         irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but
         also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with each other
         Borrower, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the
         Obligations, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the
         Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of all of the
         Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them.

                  (c) If and to the extent that any of the Borrowers shall fail
         to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when
         due or to perform any of such Obligations in accordance with the terms
         thereof, then in each such event each other Borrower will make such
         payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.

                  (d) The obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of
         this ss.5.12 constitute the absolute and unconditional obligations of
         such Borrower enforceable against it to the full extent permitted under
         the terms hereof, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
         enforceability of this Credit Agreement or any other circumstance
         whatsoever.

                  (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, each
         Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several
         liability, notice of the Loans made under this Credit Agreement, notice
         of the occurrence of any Default, or of any demand for any payment
         under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted
         by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders under or
         in respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or
         to mitigate damages and, generally, all demands, notices and other
         formalities of every kind in connection with this Credit Agreement.
         Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or
         postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the
         acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other
         action or acquiescence by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
         the Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any
         Borrowers or Guarantors in the performance or satisfaction of any term,
         covenant, condition or provision of this Credit Agreement, any and all
         other indulgences whatsoever by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Bank or the Lenders in respect of any of the obligations hereunder, and
         the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at
         any time or times, of any security for any of such obligations or the
         addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower
         or any Guarantor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,



                                      -46-
<PAGE>

         each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure
         to act on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
         Lenders including, without limitation, any failure strictly or
         diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply
         fully with Applicable Laws thereunder, which might, but for the
         provisions of this ss.5.12, afford grounds for terminating, discharging
         or relieving such Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its
         Obligations under this ss.5.12, it being the intention of each Borrower
         that, so long as any of the Obligations remain unsatisfied, the
         Obligations of such Borrower under this ss.5.12 shall not be discharged
         except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance.
         Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, the joint and
         several liability of the Borrowers hereunder shall continue in full
         force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation
         or any other change whatsoever in the name, membership, constitution or
         place of formation of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, the
         Issuing Bank or the Lenders. If at any time, any payment, or any part
         thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or
         must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent, the
         Issuing Bank or the Lenders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
         reorganization of any of the Borrowers, or otherwise, the provisions of
         this ss.5.12 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such
         payment had not been made.

                  (f) Each Borrower appoints the Borrowers' Representative as
         its authorized representative to make loan request, receive funds and
         notice and to take all other actions under this Agreement and the other
         Loan Documents on its behalf.

                     6. COLLATERAL SECURITY AND GUARANTIES.

6.1. GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. The Borrowers each hereby grant to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent, to secure the payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations,
a security interest in and so pledges and assigns to the Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the following
properties, assets and rights of the Borrowers, wherever located, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired or arising, and all proceeds and products thereof
(all of the same along with any other property, rights and interests of the
Borrowers that are or are intended to be subject to the Liens created by the
Security Documents being hereinafter called the "COLLATERAL"): all personal and
fixture property of every kind and nature including without limitation all goods
(including inventory, equipment and any accessions thereto), instruments
(including promissory notes), documents, accounts (including
health-care-insurance receivables), chattel paper (whether tangible or
electronic), deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights (whether or not the
letter of credit is evidenced by a writing), commercial tort claims, securities
and all other investment property, supporting obligations, any other contract
rights or rights to the payment of money, insurance claims and proceeds, all
general intangibles (including all payment intangibles) and the Israeli
Subsidiary Assets. The Administrative Agent acknowledges that the attachment of
its security interest in any commercial tort claim as original collateral is
subject to the Company's compliance with ss.6.3.7.

6.2. AUTHORIZATION TO FILE FINANCING STATEMENTS. The Borrowers hereby
irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time



                                      -47-
<PAGE>

to file in any filing office in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any
initial financing statements and amendments thereto that (a) indicate the
Collateral (i) as all assets of the Borrowers or words of similar effect,
regardless of whether any particular asset comprised in the Collateral falls
within the scope of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State or
such jurisdiction, or (ii) as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater
detail, and (b) provide any other information required by part 5 of Article 9 of
the Uniform Commercial Code of the State or such other jurisdiction for the
sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any financing statement or amendment,
including (i) whether the Borrowers are an organization, the type of
organization and any organizational identification number issued to the
Borrowers and, (ii) in the case of a financing statement filed as a fixture
filing or indicating Collateral as as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut,
a sufficient description of real property to which the Collateral relates. The
Borrowers agree to furnish any such information to the Administrative Agent
promptly upon the Administrative Agent's request. The Borrowers also ratify
their authorization for the Administrative Agent to have filed in any Uniform
Commercial Code jurisdiction any like initial financing statements or amendments
thereto if filed prior to the date hereof.

6.3. OTHER ACTIONS. Further to insure the attachment, perfection and first
priority of, and the ability of the Administrative Agent to enforce, the
Administrative Agent's security interest in the Collateral, the Borrowers agree,
in each case at the Borrowers' expense, to take the following actions with
respect to the following Collateral and without limitation on the Borrowers'
other obligations contained in this Agreement:

6.3.1.   PROMISSORY NOTES AND TANGIBLE CHATTEL PAPER. If the Borrowers shall,
         now or at any time hereafter, hold or acquire any promissory notes or
         tangible chattel paper, the Borrowers shall forthwith endorse, assign
         and deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, accompanied by such
         instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the
         Administrative Agent may from time to time specify.

6.3.2.   DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. For each deposit account that any Borrower, now or at
         any time hereafter, opens or maintains (each a "Deposit Account"), the
         Borrowers shall (other than with respect to Local Accounts not with
         Bank of America, N.A., SunTrust Bank/Miami, N.A. and SunTrust
         Bank/Atlanta, N.A.), pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (each a "CONTROL AGREEMENT"),
         either (a) cause the depositary bank to agree to comply, without
         further consent of the Borrowers, at any time with instructions from
         the Administrative Agent to such depositary bank directing the
         disposition of funds from time to time credited to such deposit
         account, or (b) arrange for the Administrative Agent to become the
         customer of the depositary bank with respect to the deposit account,
         with the Borrowers being permitted, only with the consent of the
         Administrative Agent, to exercise rights to withdraw funds from such
         deposit account. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to
         (i) a deposit account for which the Administrative Agent is the
         depositary bank and is in automatic control, and (ii) Exempt DDA.

6.3.3.   INVESTMENT PROPERTY. If the Borrowers shall, now or at any time
         hereafter, hold or acquire any certificated securities, the Borrowers
         shall forthwith endorse, assign and deliver the same to the
         Administrative Agent, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or
         assignment duly executed in blank as the Administrative Agent may from
         time to time specify. If any securities now or hereafter acquired by
         the Borrowers are uncertificated and are issued to the Borrowers or
         their nominee directly by the issuer thereof, the Borrowers shall



                                      -48-
<PAGE>

         immediately notify the Administrative Agent thereof and, at the
         Administrative Agent's request and option, pursuant to an agreement in
         form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, either (a)
         cause the issuer to agree to comply without further consent of the
         Borrowers or such nominee, at any time with instructions from the
         Administrative Agent as to such securities, or (b) arrange for the
         Administrative Agent to become the registered owner of the securities.
         If any securities, whether certificated or uncertificated, or other
         investment property now or hereafter acquired by the Borrowers are held
         by the Borrowers or their nominee through a securities intermediary or
         commodity intermediary, the Borrowers shall immediately notify the
         Administrative Agent thereof and, at the Administrative Agent's request
         and option, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory
         to the Administrative Agent, either (i) cause such securities
         intermediary or (as the case may be) commodity intermediary to agree to
         comply, in each case without further consent of the Borrowers or such
         nominee, at any time with entitlement orders or other instructions from
         the Administrative Agent to such securities intermediary as to such
         securities or other investment property, or (as the case may be) to
         apply any value distributed on account of any commodity contract as
         directed by the Administrative Agent to such commodity intermediary, or
         (ii) in the case of financial assets or other investment property held
         through a securities intermediary, arrange for the Administrative Agent
         to become the entitlement holder with respect to such investment
         property, with the Borrowers being permitted, only with the consent of
         the Administrative Agent, to exercise rights to withdraw or otherwise
         deal with such investment property. The provisions of this paragraph
         shall not apply to any financial assets credited to a securities
         account for which the Administrative Agent is the securities
         intermediary.

6.3.4.   COLLATERAL IN THE POSSESSION OF A BAILEE. If any Collateral is, now or
         at any time hereafter, in the possession of a bailee, the Borrowers
         shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof and, at the
         Administrative Agent's request and option, shall promptly obtain an
         acknowledgement from the bailee, in form and substance satisfactory to
         the Administrative Agent, that the bailee holds such Collateral for the
         benefit of the Administrative Agent and such bailee's agreement to
         comply, without further consent of the Borrowers, at any time with
         instructions of the Administrative Agent as to such Collateral.

6.3.5.   ELECTRONIC CHATTEL PAPER AND TRANSFERABLE RECORDS. If the Borrowers,
         now or at any time hereafter, hold or acquire an interest in any
         electronic chattel paper or any "transferable record," as that term is
         defined in Section 201 of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global
         and National Commerce Act, or in ss.16 of the Uniform Electronic
         Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction, the
         Borrowers shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof and,
         at the request and option of the Administrative Agent, shall take such
         action as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to vest in
         the Administrative Agent control, under ss.9-105 of the Uniform
         Commercial Code, of such electronic chattel paper or control under
         Section 201 of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
         Commerce Act or, as the case may be, ss.16 of the Uniform Electronic
         Transactions Act, as so in effect in such jurisdiction, of such
         transferable record.

6.3.6.   LETTER-OF-CREDIT RIGHTS. If the Borrowers are, now or at any time
         hereafter, a beneficiary under a letter of credit now or hereafter, the
         Borrowers shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof and,
         at the request and option of the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers
         shall, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
         the Administrative Agent, either (a) arrange for the issuer and any
         confirmer or other nominated person of such letter of credit to consent



                                      -49-
<PAGE>

         to an assignment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of the
         letter of credit or (b) arrange for the Administrative Agent to become
         the transferee beneficiary of the letter of credit, with the
         Administrative Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of the
         letter of credit are to be applied in accordance with ss.ss.2.14 and
         2.15.

6.3.7.   COMMERCIAL TORT CLAIMS. If the Borrowers shall, now or at any time
         hereafter, hold or acquire a commercial tort claim, the Borrowers shall
         immediately notify the Administrative Agent in a writing signed by the
         Borrowers' Representative of the particulars thereof and grant to the
         Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the
         Administrative Agent, in such writing a security interest therein and
         in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with
         such writing to be in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent.

6.3.8.   OTHER ACTIONS AS TO ANY AND ALL COLLATERAL. The Borrowers further
         agrees, upon the request of the Administrative Agent and at the
         Administrative Agent's option, to take any and all other actions as the
         Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary or useful for the
         attachment, perfection and first priority of, and the ability of the
         Administrative Agent to enforce, the Administrative Agent's security
         interest in any and all of the Collateral, including, without
         limitation, (a) executing, delivering and, where appropriate, filing
         financing statements and amendments relating thereto under the Uniform
         Commercial Code, to the extent, if any, that the Borrowers' signature
         thereon is required therefor, (b) causing the Administrative Agent's
         name to be noted as secured party on any certificate of title for a
         titled good if such notation is a condition to attachment, perfection
         or priority of, or ability of the Administrative Agent to enforce, the
         Administrative Agent's security interest in such Collateral, (c)
         complying with any provision of any statute, regulation or treaty of
         the United States as to any Collateral if compliance with such
         provision is a condition to attachment, perfection or priority of, or
         ability of the Administrative Agent to enforce, the Administrative
         Agent's security interest in such Collateral, (d) obtaining
         governmental and other third party waivers, consents and approvals, in
         form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, including,
         without limitation, any consent of any licensor, lessor or other person
         obligated on Collateral, (e) obtaining waivers from mortgagees and
         landlords in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
         Agent and (f) taking all actions under any earlier versions of the

         determined by the Administrative Agent to be applicable in any relevant
         Uniform Commercial Code or other jurisdiction, including any foreign
         jurisdiction.

6.4. RELATION TO OTHER SECURITY DOCUMENTS. The provisions of this Agreement
supplement the provisions of any real estate mortgage or deed of trust granted
by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent, and which secures the payment or performance of any of
the Obligations. Nothing contained in any such real estate mortgage or deed of
trust shall derogate from any of the rights or remedies of the Administrative
Agent or any of the Lenders hereunder. In addition, to the provisions of this
Agreement being so read and construed with any such mortgage or deed of trust,
the provisions of this Agreement shall be read and construed with the other
Security Documents referred to below in the manner so indicated.

6.4.1.   STOCK PLEDGE AGREEMENT. Concurrently herewith certain of the Borrowers
         are executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent, for the
         benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, stock pledge
         agreement(s) pursuant to which the Borrowers are pledging to the
         Administrative Agent all of the shares of the capital stock of the



                                      -50-
<PAGE>

         Borrowers' Subsidiary or Subsidiaries. Such pledge(s) shall be governed
         by the terms of such stock pledge agreement(s) and not by the terms of
         this Agreement.

6.4.2.   TRADEMARK ASSIGNMENTS. Concurrently herewith the Borrowers are
         executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit
         of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, the Trademark Assignment
         pursuant to which the Borrowers are assigning to the Administrative
         Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent,
         certain Collateral consisting of trademarks, service marks and
         trademark and service mark rights, together with the goodwill
         appurtenant thereto. The provisions of the Trademark Assignment are
         supplemental to the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained
         in the Trademark Assignment shall derogate from any of the rights or
         remedies of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders hereunder.
         Neither the delivery of, nor anything contained in, the Trademark
         Assignment shall be deemed to prevent or postpone the time of
         attachment or perfection of any security interest in such Collateral
         created hereby.

                       7. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         The Borrowers represent and warrant to the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent as follows:

         financial and market conditions used in formulating such projections.
         As of the Closing Date, to the knowledge of the Borrowers or any of
         their Subsidiaries, no facts exist that (individually or in the
         aggregate) would result in any material change in any of such
         projections. The projections are based upon reasonable estimates and
         assumptions, have been prepared on the basis of the assumptions stated
         therein and reflect the reasonable estimates of the Borrowers and their

to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the
Borrowers, any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any
officer, director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or is an
officer, director, trustee or partner.

7.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

7.16.1.  IN GENERAL. Each Employee Benefit Plan and each Guaranteed Pension Plan
         has been maintained and operated in compliance in all material respects
         with the provisions of ERISA and all Applicable Pension Legislation
         and, to the extent applicable, the Code, including but not limited to
         the provisions thereunder respecting prohibited transactions and the
         bonding of fiduciaries and other persons handling plan funds as
         required by ss.412 of ERISA. The Borrowers have heretofore delivered to
         the Administrative Agent the most recently completed annual report,
         Form 5500, with all required attachments, and actuarial statement
         required to be submitted under ss.103(d) of ERISA, with respect to each
         Guaranteed Pension Plan.

7.16.2.  TERMINABILITY OF WELFARE PLANS. No Employee Benefit Plan, which is an
         employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of ss.3(1) or
         ss.3(2)(B) of ERISA, provides benefit coverage subsequent to
         termination of employment, except as required by Title I, Part 6 of
         ERISA or the applicable state insurance laws. The Borrowers may



                                      -55-
<PAGE>

         terminate each such Plan at any time (or at any time subsequent to the
         expiration of any applicable bargaining agreement) in the discretion of
         the Borrowers without liability to any Person other than for claims
         arising prior to termination.

7.16.3.  GUARANTEED PENSION PLANS. Each contribution required to be made to a
         Guaranteed Pension Plan, whether required to be made to avoid the
         incurrence of an accumulated funding deficiency, the notice or lien
         provisions of ss.302(f) of ERISA, or otherwise, has been timely made.
         No waiver of an accumulated funding deficiency or extension of
         amortization periods has been received with respect to any Guaranteed
         Pension Plan, and neither the Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate is
         obligated to or has posted security in connection with an amendment to
         a Guaranteed Pension Plan pursuant to ss.307 of ERISA or ss.401(a)(29)
         of the Code. No liability to the PBGC (other than required insurance
         premiums, all of which have been timely paid) has been incurred by the
         Borrowers or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Guaranteed Pension
         Plan and there has not been any ERISA Reportable Event (other than an
         ERISA Reportable Event as to which the requirement of 30 days notice
         has been waived under PBGC ss.4043), or any other event or condition
         which presents a material risk of termination of any Guaranteed Pension
         Plan by the PBGC. Based on the latest valuation of each Guaranteed
         Pension Plan (which in each case occurred within twelve months of the
         date of this representation), and on the actuarial methods and
         assumptions employed for that valuation, the aggregate benefit
         liabilities of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans within the meaning of
         ss.4001 of ERISA did not exceed the aggregate value of the assets of
         all such Guaranteed Pension Plans, disregarding for this purpose the
         benefit liabilities and assets of any Guaranteed Pension Plan with
         assets in excess of benefit liabilities, by more than $500,000.

7.16.4.  MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. Neither the Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate has
         incurred any material liability (including secondary liability) to any
         Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from
         such Multiemployer Plan under ss.4201 of ERISA or as a result of a sale
         of assets described in ss.4204 of ERISA. Neither the Borrowers nor any
         ERISA Affiliate has been notified that any Multiemployer Plan is in
         reorganization or insolvent under and within the meaning of ss.4241 or
         ss.4245 of ERISA or is at risk of entering reorganization or becoming
         insolvent, or that any Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has
         been terminated under ss.4041A of ERISA.

7.17.  USE OF PROCEEDS.

7.17.1.  GENERAL. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used solely to refinance
         existing Indebtedness of the Borrowers for working capital and general
         corporate purposes. The Borrowers will obtain Letters of Credit solely
         in accordance in the ordinary course of business. No proceeds of the
         Loans may be used, nor shall any be requested, with a view towards the
         accumulation of any general fund or funded reserve of the Borrowers
         other than in the ordinary course of the Borrowers' business and
         consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

7.17.2.  REGULATIONS U AND X. No portion of any Loan is to be used, and no
         portion of any Letter of Credit is to be obtained, for the purpose of
         purchasing or carrying any "MARGIN SECURITY" or "MARGIN STOCK" as such
         terms are used in Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the
         Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224.

7.18. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. The Borrowers have taken all commercially
reasonable steps to investigate the past and present condition and usage of the



                                      -56-

         claim, action, cause of action, complaint, or legal or administrative
         proceeding (in each case, contingent or otherwise) arising out of any
         third party's incurrence of costs, expenses, losses or damages of any

         organizational activity, or other labor or employment dispute against
         or affecting the Borrowers, which, if determined adversely to the
         Borrowers would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrowers.

contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact (known to the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries in the case of any
document or information not furnished by it or any of their Subsidiaries)
necessary in order to make the statements herein or therein not misleading.
There is no fact known to the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries which has a
Material Adverse Effect, or which is reasonably likely in the future to have a
Material Adverse Effect, exclusive of effects resulting from changes in general
economic conditions, legal standards or regulatory conditions.

                            8. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

         status of such litigation or proceedings. The Borrowers will, and will



                                      -62-
<PAGE>

         cause each of their Subsidiaries to, give notice to the Administrative
         Agent and each of the Lenders, in writing, in form and detail
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days of any

         President, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, and chief
         financial officer (without regard to the title(s) actually given to the
         Persons discharging the duties customarily discharged by officers with
         those titles) or any intention on the part of the Borrowers to
         discharge the Borrowers' present independent accountants or any
         withdrawal or resignation by such independent accountants from their
         acting in such capacity.

8.6. LEGAL EXISTENCE; MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The Borrowers will do or cause

Subsidiaries to, convert to a limited liability company or a limited liability
partnership; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, Mayor's may, upon notice to the Administrative
Agent, dissolve Subsidiaries other than Mayor's Fla if the dissolution is, in
the judgment of the Borrowers, desirable and would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each (i) will cause all of its properties and those of its Subsidiaries
used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of its
Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working
order and supplied with all necessary equipment, (ii) will cause to be made all

continue to engage primarily in the businesses now conducted by them and in
related businesses; PROVIDED that nothing in this ss.8.6 shall prevent the
Borrowers from discontinuing the operation and maintenance of any of their
properties or any of those of its Subsidiaries if such discontinuance is, in the
judgment of the Borrowers, desirable in the conduct of its or their business and
that do not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

8.7.  INSURANCE.

8.7.1.   MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. SCHEDULE 8.7.1 hereto, is a schedule of all
         insurance policies owned by the Borrowers or under which the Borrowers
         are the named insured. Each of such policies is in full force and



                                      -63-
<PAGE>

         effect. The Borrowers will maintain with financially sound and
         reputable insurers insurance with respect to its properties and
         business against such casualties and contingencies as shall be in
         accordance with general practices of businesses engaged in similar
         activities in similar geographic areas. Such insurance shall be in such
         minimum amounts that the Borrowers will not be deemed a co-insurer
         under applicable insurance laws, regulations and policies and otherwise
         shall be in such amounts, contain such terms, be in such forms and be
         for such periods as may be reasonably satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent. In addition, all such insurance shall be payable
         to the Administrative Agent as loss payee under a "standard" or "New
         York" loss payee clause for the benefit of the Lenders and the
         Administrative Agent and shall not include an endorsement in favor of
         any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrowers will
         (a) keep all of their physical property insured with casualty or
         physical hazard insurance on an "all risks" basis, with broad form
         flood and earthquake coverages and electronic data processing coverage,
         with a full replacement cost endorsement and an "agreed amount" clause
         in an amount equal to 100% of the full replacement cost of such
         property, (b) maintain all such workers' compensation or similar
         insurance as may be required by law and (c) maintain, in amounts and
         with deductibles equal to those generally maintained by businesses
         engaged in similar activities in similar geographic areas, general
         public liability insurance against claims of bodily injury, death or
         property damage occurring, on, in or about the properties of the
         Borrowers; business interruption insurance; and product liability
         insurance.

8.7.2.   INSURANCE PROCEEDS. The proceeds of any casualty insurance in respect
         of any casualty loss of any of the Collateral shall, subject to the
         rights, if any, of other parties with an interest having priority in
         the property covered thereby, (a) so long as no Default exists and to
         the extent that the amount of such proceeds is less than $1,000,000, be
         disbursed to the Borrowers for direct application by the Borrowers
         solely to the repair or replacement of the Borrowers' property so
         damaged or destroyed and (b) in all other circumstances, be held by the
         Administrative Agent as cash collateral for the Obligations. The
         Administrative Agent may, at its sole option, disburse from time to
         time all or any part of such proceeds so held as cash collateral, upon
         such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may reasonably
         prescribe, for direct application by the Borrowers solely to the repair
         or replacement of the Borrowers' property so damaged or destroyed, or
         the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of such proceeds to
         the Obligations with the Commitment (if not then terminated) being
         reduced by the amount so applied to the Obligations.

8.7.3.   CONTINUATION OF INSURANCE. All policies of insurance shall provide for
         at least sixty (60) days prior written cancellation notice to the
         Administrative Agent. In the event of failure by the Borrowers to
         provide and maintain insurance as herein provided, the Administrative
         Agent may, at its option, provide such insurance and charge the amount
         thereof to the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall furnish the
         Administrative Agent with certificates of insurance and policies
         evidencing compliance with the foregoing insurance provision.

8.8. TAXES. The Borrowers will, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries to,
duly pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and discharged, before the same
shall become overdue, all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges
imposed upon it and its Real Estate, sales and activities, or any part thereof,
or upon the income or profits therefrom, as well as all claims for labor,
materials, or supplies that if unpaid would by law become a Lien or charge upon
any of its property; PROVIDED that any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or



                                      -64-
<PAGE>

claim need not be paid if the validity or amount thereof shall currently be
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and if the Borrowers or such
Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the Borrowers and each Subsidiary of the
Borrowers will pay all such taxes, assessments, charges, levies or claims
forthwith upon the commencement of proceedings to foreclose any Lien that may
have attached as security therefor.

8.9.  INSPECTION OF PROPERTIES AND BOOKS, ETC.

8.9.1.   GENERAL. The Borrowers shall permit the Lenders, through the
         Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders' other designated
         representatives, to visit and inspect any of the properties of the
         Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, to examine the books of account
         of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries (and to make copies thereof and
         extracts therefrom, duplicate, cause to be reduced to hard copy, run
         off, draw off, and otherwise use any and all computer or electronically
         stored information or data which relates to the Borrowers, or any
         service bureau, contractor, accountant, or other person), and to
         discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrowers and their
         Subsidiaries with, and to be advised as to the same by, its and their
         officers, and to conduct examinations and verifications (whether by
         internal commercial finance examiners or independent auditors) of all
         components included in the Borrowing Base, all at such reasonable times
         and intervals as the Administrative Agent or any Lender may reasonably
         request. The Administrative Agent may, at the Borrowers' expense,
         participate in or observe any physical count of inventory included in
         the Collateral.

8.9.2    COLLATERAL REPORTS; PHYSICAL INVENTORIES.

                           (a) Not less frequent than four times during each
                  calendar year, upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
                  the Borrowers will obtain and deliver to the Administrative
                  Agent, or, if the Administrative Agent so elects, will
                  cooperate with the Administrative Agent in the Administrative
                  Agent's obtaining, a report of an independent collateral
                  auditor satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which may be
                  affiliated with one of the Lenders) with respect to the
                  Accounts Receivable and inventory components included in the
                  Borrowing Base, which report shall indicate whether or not the
                  information set forth in the Borrowing Base Report most
                  recently delivered is accurate and complete in all material
                  respects based upon a review by such auditors of the Accounts
                  Receivable (including verification with respect to the amount,
                  aging, identity and credit of the respective account debtors
                  and the billing practices of the Borrowers or their applicable
                  Subsidiary) and inventory (including verification as to the
                  value, location and respective types). All such collateral
                  value reports shall be conducted and made at the expense of
                  the Borrowers.

                           (b) The Borrowers, at their own expense, shall cause
                  not less than two (2) physical inventories to be undertaken in
                  each twelve (12) month period during which this Agreement is
                  in effect (the spacing of the scheduling of which inventories
                  shall be subject to the Administrative Agent's reasonable
                  discretion) conducted by such inventory takers as are
                  satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and following such

         aggregate amount exceeding $* and (B) could constitute grounds for the
         termination of such Guaranteed Pension Plan by the PBGC, for the
         appointment by the appropriate United States District Court of a
         trustee to administer such Guaranteed Pension Plan or for the
         imposition of a lien in favor of such Guaranteed Pension Plan; or (ii)
         the appointment by a United States District Court of a trustee to
         administer such Guaranteed Pension Plan; or (iii) the institution by
         the PBGC of proceedings to terminate such Guaranteed Pension Plan;

                  (l) the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries shall be
         enjoined, restrained or in any way prevented by the order of any
         Governmental Authority from conducting (i) any material part of its
         business or (ii) business at more than five (5) retail locations or the
         Headquarters Facility, and such order shall continue in effect for more
         than fifteen (15) days;

                  (m) there shall occur any material damage to, or loss, theft
         or destruction of, any Collateral, whether or not insured, or any
         strike, lockout, labor dispute, embargo, condemnation, act of God or
         public enemy, or other casualty, which in any such case causes, for
         more than fifteen (15) consecutive days, the cessation or substantial
         curtailment of revenue producing activities at more than five (5)
         retail locations not covered by business interruption insurance or the
         Headquarters Facility;

                  (n) there shall occur the loss, suspension or revocation of,
         or failure to renew, any license or permit now held or hereafter
         acquired by the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries if such loss,
         suspension, revocation or failure to renew would have a Material
         Adverse Effect;

<PAGE>

                  (o) the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries shall be
         indicted for a state or federal crime, or any civil or criminal action
         shall otherwise have been brought or threatened against the Borrowers
         or any of their Subsidiaries, a punishment for which in any such case
         could include the forfeiture of any assets of the Borrowers or such
         Subsidiary included in the Borrowing Base or any assets of the
         Borrowers or such Subsidiary not included in the Borrowing Base but
         having a fair market value in excess of $500,000 (unless covered by
         insurance);

                  (p) the Chief Executive of Officer of Mayor's is not either
         Joseph Cicio or Thomas Andruskevich or David Boudreau shall cease to be
         employed as Chief Financial Officer of Mayor's, and in each case an
         individual acceptable to the Administrative Agent shall not have been
         hired within 45 days to replace such person; or

                  (q) a Change of Control shall occur;

then, and in any such event, so long as the same may be continuing, the
Administrative Agent may, and shall upon the request of (i) the SuperMajority
Lenders or, (ii) following the Standstill Termination Date, the Tranche B
Lender, by notice in writing to the Borrowers Representative declare all amounts
owing with respect to this Agreement, the Loan Account, the Notes and the other
Loan Documents and all Reimbursement Obligations to be, and they shall thereupon
forthwith become, immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
the Borrowers; PROVIDED that in the event of any Event of Default specified in
ss.ss.13.1(g), 13.1(h) or 13.1(j), all such amounts shall become immediately due
and payable automatically and without any requirement of notice from the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. Following the Standstill Termination Date,
if requested by the Tranche B Lender the Administrative Agent will exercise
those rights accorded to the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents as a
creditor of the Borrowers looking towards the realization on the Collateral (a
"LIQUIDATION"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall
have the sole authority to determine the procedures to effect a Liquidation.


                                      -82-
<PAGE>


13.2. TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. If any one or more of the Events of Default
specified in ss.13.1(g), ss.13.1(h) or ss.13.1(j) shall occur, any unused
portion of the credit hereunder shall forthwith terminate and each of the
Lenders shall be relieved of all further obligations to make Loans to the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all further
obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. If any other Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or if on any Drawdown Date or
other date for issuing, extending or renewing any Letter of Credit the
conditions precedent to the making of the Loans to be made on such Drawdown Date
or (as the case may be) to issuing, extending or renewing such Letter of Credit
on such other date are not satisfied, the Administrative Agent may and, upon the
request of the SuperMajority Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrowers'
Representative, terminate the unused portion of the credit hereunder, and upon
such notice being given such unused portion of the credit hereunder shall
terminate immediately and each of the Lenders shall be relieved of all further
obligations to make Loans and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all
further obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. No termination
of the credit hereunder shall relieve the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries
of any of the Obligations.

13.3.  REMEDIES.

13.3.1.  GENERAL.

                  (a) In case any one or more of the Events of Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lenders shall
         have accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to ss.13.1, each
         Lender, if owed any amount with respect to the Loans or the
         Reimbursement Obligations, may, with the consent of the SuperMajority
         Lenders or the Administrative Agent but not otherwise, proceed to
         protect and enforce its rights by suit in equity, action at law or
         other appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of
         any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and the other
         Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to
         such Lender are evidenced, including as permitted by applicable law the
         obtaining of the EX PARTE appointment of a receiver, and, if such
         amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to
         enforce the payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of
         such Lender. No remedy herein conferred upon any Lender or the
         Administrative Agent or the holder of any Note or purchaser of any
         Letter of Credit Participation is intended to be exclusive of any other
         remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
         addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
         existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of
         law.

                  (b) If a Default has occurred, the Administrative Agent,
         without any other notice to or demand upon the Borrowers, shall have in
         any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to
         all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured
         party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State and any additional
         rights and remedies as may be provided to a secured party in any
         jurisdiction in which Collateral is located, including, without
         limitation, the right to take possession of the Collateral, and for
         that purpose the Administrative Agent may, so far as the Borrowers can
         give authority therefor, enter upon any premises on which the
         Collateral may be situated and remove the same therefrom. The
         Administrative Agent may in its reasonable discretion require the
         Borrowers to assemble all or any part of the Collateral at such



                                      -83-
<PAGE>

         location or locations within the jurisdiction(s) of the Company's
         principal office(s) or at such other locations as the Administrative
         Agent may reasonably designate. Unless the Collateral is perishable or
         threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold
         on a recognized market, the Administrative Agent shall give to the
         Borrowers at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of the
         time and place of any public sale of Collateral or of the time after
         which any private sale or any other intended disposition is to be made.
         The Borrowers hereby acknowledges that five (5) Business Days prior
         written notice of such sale or sales shall be reasonable notice. In
         addition, the Borrowers waive any and all rights that they may have to
         a judicial hearing in advance of the enforcement of any of the
         Administrative Agent's rights and remedies hereunder, including,
         without limitation, its right if a Default exists to take immediate
         possession of the Collateral and to exercise its rights and remedies
         with respect thereto.

13.3.2.  SECURITIES AND DEPOSITS. The Administrative Agent may at any time, at
         its option, transfer to itself or any nominee any securities
         constituting Collateral, receive any income thereon and hold such
         income as additional Collateral or apply it to the Obligations. Whether
         or not any Obligations are due, the Administrative Agent may demand,
         sue for, collect, or make any settlement or compromise which it deems
         desirable with respect to the Collateral. Regardless of the adequacy of
         Collateral or any other security for the Obligations, any deposits or
         other sums at any time credited by or due from the Administrative Agent
         or any Lender to the Borrowers may at any time be applied to or set off
         against any of the Obligations.

13.3.3.  NOTIFICATION TO ACCOUNT DEBTORS AND OTHER PERSONS OBLIGATED ON
         COLLATERAL. The Borrowers shall, at the request and option of the
         Administrative Agent, notify account debtors and other persons
         obligated on any of the Collateral of the security interest of the
         Administrative Agent in any account, chattel paper, general intangible,
         instrument or other Collateral and that payment thereof is to be made
         directly to the Administrative Agent or to any financial institution
         designated by the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent's
         agent therefor, and the Administrative Agent may itself, without notice
         to or demand upon the Borrowers, so notify account debtors and other
         persons obligated on Collateral. After the making of such a request or
         the giving of any such notification, the Borrowers shall hold any
         proceeds of collection of accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles,
         instruments and other Collateral received by the Borrowers as trustee
         for the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the
         Administrative Agent, without commingling the same with other funds of
         the Borrowers and shall turn the same over to the Administrative Agent
         in the identical form received, together with any necessary
         endorsements or assignments. The Administrative Agent shall apply the
         proceeds of collection of accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles,
         instruments and other Collateral received by the Administrative Agent
         to the Obligations, such proceeds to be immediately credited after
         final payment in cash or other immediately available funds of the items
         giving rise to them.

13.3.4.  STANDARDS FOR EXERCISING RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. To the extent that
         applicable law imposes duties on the Administrative Agent to exercise
         remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, the Borrowers acknowledge
         and agree that it is not commercially unreasonable for the
         Administrative Agent (a) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed
         significant by the Administrative Agent to prepare Collateral for
         disposition or otherwise to fail to complete raw material or work in
         process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition,
         (b) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to
         be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail
         to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or
         disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) to fail
         to exercise collection remedies against account debtors or other
         persons obligated on Collateral or to fail to remove Liens on or any



                                      -84-
<PAGE>

         adverse claims against Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies
         against account debtors and other persons obligated on Collateral
         directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection
         specialists, (e) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through
         publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the
         Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) to contact other persons,
         whether or not in the same business as the Borrowers, for expressions
         of interest in acquiring all or any portion of the Collateral, (g) to
         hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition
         of Collateral, whether or not the collateral is of a specialized
         nature, (h) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that
         provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the
         Collateral or that have the reasonable capability of doing so, or that
         match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets in
         wholesale rather than retail markets, (j) to disclaim disposition
         warranties, (k) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure
         the Administrative Agent against risks of loss, collection or
         disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Administrative Agent a
         guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or
         (l) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent, to
         obtain the services of brokers, investment bankers, consultants and
         other professionals to assist the Administrative Agent in the
         collection or disposition of any of the Collateral, or (m) conduct
         going out of business sales and otherwise liquidate the inventory. The
         Borrowers acknowledge that the purpose of this ss.13.3.4 is tO provide
         non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the
         Administrative Agent would fulfill the Administrative Agent's duties
         under the Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
         or any other relevant jurisdiction in the Administrative Agent's
         exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or
         omissions by the Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to fail to
         fulfill such duties solely on account of not being indicated in this
         ss.13.3.4. WithouT limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in
         this ss.13.3.4. shall be construed to grant any rightS to the Borrowers
         or to impose any duties on the Administrative Agent that would not have
         been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by applicable law in the
         absence of this ss.13.3.4.

13.4. DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that, an Event of
Default exists, the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be,
receives any monies in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any
the Security Documents, or otherwise with respect to the realization upon, or
disposition of, any of the Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for
application as follows:

                  (a) First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
         reimbursement of the Administrative Agent for or in respect of all
         reasonable costs, expenses, disbursements and losses which shall have
         been incurred or sustained by the Administrative Agent in connection
         with the collection of such monies by the Administrative Agent or, the
         Administrative Agent's Special Counsel or Lender's Special Counsel, for
         the exercise, protection or enforcement by the Administrative Agent,
         the Administrative Agent's Special Counsel or Lender's Special Counsel
         of all or any of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the
         Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's Special Counsel or



                                      -85-

         Lender's Special Counsel under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
         Documents or in respect of the Collateral or in support of any
         provision of adequate indemnity to the Administrative Agent against any
         taxes or liens which by law shall have, or may have, priority over the
         rights of the Administrative Agent to such monies;

                  (b) Second, to all Obligations owing to the Revolving Credit
         Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including the making allowance to
         take into account for any Obligations not then due and payable (i.e.,
         to cash collateralize up to 105% of the Maximum Drawing Amount) and
         excluding the Revolving Credit Early Termination Fee, Obligations under
         Interest Rate Agreements and Obligations pursuant to subsection (b) of
         the definition of Obligations to the extent that they do not relate to
         cash management or similar services) in such order or preference as the
         Required Revolving Credit Lenders may determine; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
         that (i) distributions shall be made (A) PARI PASSU among Obligations
         with respect to the Administrative Agent's Monitoring Fee and all other
         Obligations owed to the Revolving Credit Lenders and (B) with respect
         to each type of Obligation owing to the Revolving Credit Lenders, such
         as interest, principal, reasonable fees and expenses, among the
         Revolving Credit Lenders PRO RATA, and (ii) the Administrative Agent
         may in its reasonable discretion make proper allowance to take into
         account any Obligations not then due and payable;

                  (c) Third, to all Obligations owing to the Tranche B Lender
         (excluding the Tranche B Early Termination Fee);

                  (d) Fourth, to the Administrative Agent and the Revolving
         Credit Lenders on account of Obligations relating to the Revolving
         Credit Early Termination Fee;

                  (e) Fifth, to the Tranche B Lender on account of all other

         Credit Lenders; and

                  (g) Seventh, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other
         provisions for payment in full satisfactory to the Lenders and the
         Administrative Agent of all of the Obligations, to the payment of any
         obligations required to be paid pursuant to ss.9-608(a)(1)(C) or
         9-615(a)(3) of the Uniform CommerciaL Code of the Commonwealth of
         Massachusetts; and

                  (h) Seventh, the excess, if any, shall be returned to the
         Borrowers or to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

                         14. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

14.1.  AUTHORIZATION.

                  (a) The Administrative Agent is authorized to take such action
         on behalf of each of the Lenders and to exercise all such powers as are
         hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related
         documents delegated to the Administrative Agent, together with such
         powers as are reasonably incident thereto, including the authority,
         without the necessity of any notice to or further consent of the
         Lenders, from time to time to take any action with respect to any
         Collateral or the Security Documents which may be necessary to perfect,



                                      -86-
<PAGE>

         maintain perfected or insure the priority of the security interest in
         and liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the Security
         Documents, PROVIDED that no duties or responsibilities not expressly
         assumed herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the
         Administrative Agent.

                  (b) The relationship between the Administrative Agent and each
         of the Lenders is that of an independent contractor. The use of the
         term "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT" is for convenience only and is used to
         describe, as a form of convention, the independent contractual
         relationship between the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders.
         Nothing contained in this Agreement nor the other Loan Documents shall
         be construed to create an agency, trust or other fiduciary relationship
         between the Administrative Agent and any of the Lenders.

                  (c) As an independent contractor empowered by the Lenders to
         exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities
         hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent
         is nevertheless a "REPRESENTATIVE" of the Lenders, as that term is
         defined in Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of
         actions for the benefit of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
         with respect to all collateral security and guaranties contemplated by
         the Loan Documents. Such actions include the designation of the
         Administrative Agent as "SECURED PARTY", "MORTGAGEE" or the like on all
         financing statements and other documents and instruments, whether
         recorded or otherwise, relating to the attachment, perfection, priority
         or enforcement of any security interests, mortgages or deeds of trust
         in collateral security intended to secure the payment or performance of
         any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of the Lenders and the
         Administrative Agent.

14.2. EMPLOYEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS. The Administrative Agent may exercise
its powers and execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be
entitled to take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters
pertaining to its rights and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. The Administrative Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as
the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may reasonably determine, and
all reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons shall be paid by the
Borrowers.

14.3. NO LIABILITY. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
shareholders, directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting
them in their duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any
waiver, consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken,
in good faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents,
or in connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences
of any oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Administrative
Agent or such other Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to
its willful misconduct or gross negligence. The burden of establishing that the
Administrative Agent has at any time failed to act in a reasonable manner in the
exercise of its discretion shall be on the Borrowers and may only be made on
clear and convincing evidence.

14.4.  NO REPRESENTATIONS.

14.4.1.  GENERAL. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
         execution or validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes,
         the Letters of Credit, any of the other Loan Documents or any
         instrument at any time constituting, or intended to constitute,
         collateral security for the Notes, or for the value of any such
         collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or
         collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the Notes, or
         for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made
         herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or



                                      -87-
<PAGE>

         instrument hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrowers
         or any of their Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to
         the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions,
         covenants or agreements herein or in any instrument at any time
         constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the
         Notes or to inspect any of the properties, books or records of the
         Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall
         not be bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or
         request delivered to it by the Borrowers or any holder of any of the
         Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and
         complete. The Administrative Agent has not made nor does it now make
         any representations or warranties, express or implied, nor does it
         assume any liability to the Lenders, with respect to the credit
         worthiness or financial conditions of the Borrowers or any of their
         Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and

         the Administrative Agent the distribution of any amount received by it
         in such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other

         any Letter of Credit Participation or (b) to comply with the provisions
         of ss.16.1 with respect to making dispositions and arrangements witH
         the other Revolving Credit Lenders, where such Revolving Credit
         Lender's share of any payment received, whether by setoff or otherwise,
         is in excess of its PRO RATA share of such payments due and payable to
         all of the Revolving Credit Lenders, in each case as, when and to the

         otherwise, to the remaining nondelinquent Revolving Credit Lenders for

         distribute such payments to the nondelinquent Revolving Credit Lenders
         in proportion to their respective PRO RATA shares of all outstanding
         Revolving Credit Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. A
         Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a
         delinquency when and if, as a result of application of the assigned
         payments to all outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations
         of the nondelinquent Lenders, the Revolving Credit Lenders' respective
         PRO RATA shares of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Unpaid
         Reimbursement Obligations have returned to those in effect immediately
         prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the nonpayment
         causing such delinquency.

14.6. HOLDERS OF NOTES. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the absolute
owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been

holder, assignee or transferee.

14.7. INDEMNITY. The Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and hold harmless
the Administrative Agent and its affiliates from and against any and all claims,
actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages, costs,
expenses (including any expenses for which the Administrative Agent or such
affiliate has not been reimbursed by the Borrowers as required by ss.16.2), and
liabilities of every nature and character arising ouT of or related to this
Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or the Administrative Agent's
actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same
shall be directly caused by the Administrative Agent's willful misconduct or
gross negligence.

have the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect

have were it not also the Administrative Agent.

14.9. RESIGNATION. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving
sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers'
Representative. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders and the Tranche
B Lender shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent.

successor Administrative Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers.
If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and the Tranche B Lender and shall have accepted such
appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's



                                      -89-
<PAGE>

giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be
(a) a financial institution having a rating of not less than A or its equivalent
by S&P or (b) following the exercise of the buyout option set forth in ss.3.7,
the Tranche B Lender or any other Person appointed by the Tranche B Lender. Upon
thE acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation, the provisions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
Administrative Agent.

14.10. NOTIFICATION IF DEFAULT EXISTS. Each Lender hereby agrees that, upon

Date, the Tranche B Lender, and (b) the Lenders have provided to the
Administrative Agent such additional indemnities and assurances against expenses
and liabilities as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, proceed to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement and the other Security Documents
authorizing the sale or other disposition of all or any part of the Collateral
and exercise all or any such other legal and equitable and other rights or
remedies as it may have in respect of such Collateral. The SuperMajority Lenders
or, following the Standstill Termination Date if the SuperMajority Lenders have
not already done so, the Tranche B Lender, may direct the Administrative Agent
in writing as to the method and the extent of any such sale or other
disposition, the Lenders hereby agreeing to indemnify and hold the
Administrative Agent, harmless from all liabilities incurred in respect of all
actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, PROVIDED that the
Administrative Agent need not comply with any such direction to the extent that
the Administrative Agent reasonably believes the Administrative Agent's
compliance with such direction to be unlawful or commercially unreasonable in
any applicable jurisdiction.

14.12. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES WITH REGARD TO COLLATERAL.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers shall remain
obligated and liable under each contract or agreement comprised in the
Collateral to be observed or performed by the Borrowers thereunder. Neither the

or sufficiency of any payment received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
in respect of the Collateral or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any
party under any such contract or agreement, to present or file any claim, to

Administrative Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and
physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under ss.9-207 of the

granted by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent.

otherwise, and shall retain and apply to the payment of Obligations owed to such
Lender any amount in excess of its "ratable portion" of the payments received by
all of the Lenders with respect to the Obligations owed to all of the Lenders,

with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, PRO TANTO assignment
of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender receiving in
respect of the Obligations owed it its "ratable portion" as contemplated by this
Agreement; PROVIDED that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such Lender, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded
and the amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. As

received if the amounts had been applied in accordance with ss.13.4.

                  interest payments, or the maturity of the Revolving Credit
                  Loans (other than following a Default), PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
                  that the foregoing shall not in any way limit the rights of
                  the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders to
                  make adjustments to Reserves or otherwise modify the Borrowing
                  Base and Tranche B Borrowing Base as permitted by this
                  Agreement;

                  (d) without the written consent of the Administrative Agent,
         amend or waive ss.2.9.2., ss.15, The amount or time of payment of the
         Administrative Agent Fee or any Letter of Credit Fees payable for the
         Administrative Agent's account or any other provision applicable to the
         Administrative Agent.

No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or
impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission
on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right
shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice
to or demand upon the Borrowers shall entitle the Borrowers to other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. The Administrative Agent may
deem a Lender to have granted its consent or approval of a course of action
proposed by the Administrative Agent unless the Administrative Agent has
received objection for such Lender seven (7) Business Days after notice has been
given to such Lender of the Administrative Agent's request for a consent or
approval of a proposed course of action to be followed by the Administrative
Agent, PROVIDED THAT the Administrative Agent may rely on such passage of time



                                     -102-

as consent by a only if such notice states that consent will be deemed effective
if no objection is received within such time period. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall have
the authority to consent to the Borrowers selling, or entering into agreements
to sell, assets of the Borrowers (a) without the consent of the Revolving Credit
Lenders so long as (i) no OverLoan exists, or is projected to exist, upon the
completion of such sale or transfer or (ii) the Borrowers receive, or under the
terms of the agreements are projected to receive, net proceeds from such sales
or transfers (A) at least equal to the amount by which the Borrowing Base will
be decreased as a result of such sale or transfer or (B) sufficient to pay in
full all principal, interest, fees and other amounts due to the Revolving Credit
Lenders and cash collateralize the Maximum Drawing Amount or (b) without the
consent of the Tranche B Lender so long as (i) no OverLoan exists, will exist,
or is projected to exist, upon the completion of such sale or transfer or (ii)
the Tranche B Lender has received a Buyout Exercise Notice with respect to such
sale or transfer and either (A) the Administrative Agent shall not have received
a Buyout Acceptance Notice from the Tranche B Lender within ten (10) days
following the Tranche B Lender's receipt of such Buyout Exercise Notice or (B)
the Tranche B Lender shall have delivered a Buyout Acceptance Notice to the
Administrative Agent, but the Tranche B Lender shall have failed to complete the
assignment contemplated by ss.3.7 within three (3) Business Days following the
Buyout Acceptance Notice.

16.13.  POWER OF ATTORNEY.

16.13.1. APPOINTMENT AND POWERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Borrowers hereby
         irrevocably constitute and appoint the Administrative Agent and any
         officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as their
         true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with full irrevocable power and
         authority in the place and stead of the Borrowers or in the
         Administrative Agent's own name, for the purpose of carrying out the
         terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to
         execute any and all documents and instruments that may be necessary or
         useful to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and, without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing, hereby gives said attorneys
         the power and right, on behalf of the Borrowers, without notice to or
         assent by the Borrowers, to do the following:

                           (a) if a Default exist, generally to sell, transfer,
                  pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise
                  dispose of or deal with any of the Collateral in such manner
                  as is consistent with the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
                  and as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent
                  were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do,
                  at the Borrowers' expense, at any time, or from time to time,
                  all acts and things which the Administrative Agent deems
                  necessary or useful to protect, preserve or realize upon the
                  Collateral and the Administrative Agent's security interest
                  therein, in order to effect the intent of this Agreement, all
                  no less fully and effectively as the Borrowers might do,
                  including, without limitation, (i) the filing and prosecuting
                  of registration and transfer applications with the appropriate



                                     -103-
<PAGE>

                  federal, state or local agencies or authorities with respect
                  to trademarks, copyrights and patentable inventions and
                  processes, (ii) upon written notice to the Borrower's
                  Representative, the exercise of voting rights with respect to
                  voting securities, which rights may be exercised, if the
                  Administrative Agent so elects, with a view to causing the
                  liquidation of assets of the issuer of any such securities and
                  (iii) the execution, delivery and recording, in connection
                  with any sale or other disposition of any Collateral, of the
                  endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance
                  or transfer with respect to such Collateral; and

                           (b) to the extent that the Borrowers' authorization
                  given in ss.6.2 is noT sufficient, to file such financing
                  statements with respect hereto, with or without the Borrowers'
                  signature, or a photocopy of this Agreement in substitution
                  for a financing statement, as the Administrative Agent may
                  deem appropriate and to execute in the Borrowers' name such
                  financing statements and amendments thereto and continuation
                  statements which may require the Borrowers' signature.

16.13.2. RATIFICATION BY BORROWERS. To the extent permitted by law, the
         Borrowers hereby ratify all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or
         cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power
         coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

16.13.3. NO DUTY ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The powers conferred on the
         Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect the interests of
         the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the Collateral and shall
         not impose any duty upon the Administrative Agent to exercise any such
         powers. The Administrative Agent shall be accountable only for the
         amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such
         powers, and neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or
         agents shall be responsible to the Borrowers for any act or failure to
         act, except for the Administrative Agent's own gross negligence or
         willful misconduct.

16.14. SURETYSHIP WAIVERS BY THE BORROWERS. The Borrowers waive demand, notice,
protest, notice of acceptance of this Agreement, notice of loans made, credit
extended, Collateral received or delivered or other action taken in reliance
hereon and all other demands and notices of any description. With respect to
both the Obligations and the Collateral, the Borrowers assent to any extension
or postponement of the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any
substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any security interest
in any Collateral, to the addition or release of any party or person primarily
or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payment thereon and the
settlement, compromising or adjusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at
such time or times as the Administrative Agent may deem advisable. The
Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of
the Collateral or any income therefrom, the preservation of rights against prior
parties, or the preservation of any rights pertaining thereto beyond the safe
custody thereof as set forth in ss.14.12. The Borrowers further waive any and
all other suretyship defenses.

16.15. MARSHALLING. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be
required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not
limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the
Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other
assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of the rights and
remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder and of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in respect of such collateral security and
other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other
rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully
may, the Borrowers hereby agree that they will not invoke any law relating to
the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the
enforcement of the Administrative Agent's rights and remedies under this



                                     -104-
<PAGE>

Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the
Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any
of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to
the extent that it lawfully may, the Borrowers hereby irrevocably waive the
benefits of all such laws.

16.16. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any
one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole
or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall
affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and
shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other
jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction.
