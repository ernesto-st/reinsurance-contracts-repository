          <I>Applications.</I> At any time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date,
          the L/C Issuer shall, at the request of the Borrower, issue one or more Letters
          of Credit in U.S. Dollars, in a form satisfactory to the L/C Issuer, with
          expiration dates no later than 18&nbsp;months from the date of issuance (or
          which are cancelable not later than 18&nbsp;months from the date of issuance and
          each renewal) in an aggregate face amount as set forth above, upon the receipt
          of an application duly executed by the Borrower and, if such Letter of Credit is
          also for the account of MAF&nbsp;Developments (or any joint venture in which
          MAF&nbsp;Developments is a partner), MAF&nbsp;Developments for the relevant

          Notwithstanding anything contained in any Application to the contrary:
          (i)&nbsp;the Borrower shall pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit as
          set forth in Section&nbsp;2.1 hereof, (ii)&nbsp;except as otherwise provided
          herein, unless an Event of Default exists, the L/C&nbsp;Issuer will not call for
          additional collateral security for the obligations of the Borrower under the
          Applications, (iii)&nbsp;except as otherwise provided herein, unless an Event of
          Default exists, the L/C Issuer will not call for the funding by the Borrower of
          any amount under a Letter of Credit before being presented with a drawing
          thereunder, and (iv)&nbsp;if the L/C Issuer is not timely reimbursed for the
          amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date such drawing is paid,
          the Borrower&#146;s obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of
          such drawing shall bear interest (which the Borrower hereby promises to pay)
          from and after the date such drawing is paid at a rate per annum equal to the
          sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect
          (computed on the basis of a year of 360&nbsp;days and the actual number of days
          elapsed). If the L/C Issuer issues any Letter of Credit with an expiration date
          that is automatically extended unless the L/C&nbsp;Issuer gives notice that the
          expiration date will not so extend beyond its then scheduled expiration date,
          unless the Required Lenders instruct the L/C&nbsp;Issuer otherwise, the L/C
          Issuer will give such notice of non-renewal before the time necessary to prevent
          such automatic extension if before such required notice date: (i)&nbsp;the
          Revolving Credit Commitments have been terminated or (ii)&nbsp;a Default or an
          Event of Default exists and the Administrative Agent, at the request or with the
          consent of the Required Lenders, has given the L/C Issuer instructions not to so
          permit the extension of the expiration date of such Letter of Credit. For any
          Letter of Credit requested with an expiry date extending beyond the Revolving
          Credit Termination Date, the Borrower hereby agrees to (i)&nbsp;deposit cash
          with the Administrative Agent on or before the Revolving Credit Termination Date

          (ii)&nbsp;deposit with the Administrative Agent on or before the Revolving
          Credit Termination Date investments in direct obligations of the United States
          of America or of any agency or instrumentality thereof whose obligations
          constitute full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America in

          case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (Chicago time) on) the

          that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent
          may assume that such Lender has made such payment when due and the
          Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be
          required to) make available to the Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made
          by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in fact made such payment to the
          Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative
          Agent the amount made available to the Borrower attributable to such Lender
          together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
          commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending
          on (but excluding) the date such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
          Agent at a rate per annum equal to: (i)&nbsp;from the date the related advance
          was made by the Administrative Agent to the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days
          after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each
          such day and (ii)&nbsp;from the date two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after the date
          such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such
          Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. If such amount is not
          received from such Lender by the Administrative Agent immediately upon demand,
          the Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of
          the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum
          equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such
          payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan under
          Section&nbsp;1.12 hereof so that the Borrower will have no liability under such

          organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof
          and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $200,000,000. Upon the

          all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent under the Loan

          </I> <I>Participants</I>. Each Lender shall have the right at its own cost to
          grant participations (to be evidenced by one or more agreements or certificates
          of participation) in the Loans made and Reimbursement Obligations and/or
          Commitments held by such Lender at any time and from time to time to one or more
          other Persons; provided that no such participation shall relieve any Lender of
          any of its obligations under this Agreement, and, provided, further that no such
          participant shall have any rights under this Agreement except as provided in
          this Section, and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation or
          responsibility to such participant. Any agreement pursuant to which such
          participation is granted shall provide that the granting Lender shall retain the
          sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower under
          this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including, without limitation, the
          right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the
          Loan Documents, except that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not
          agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of the Loan Documents that would
          reduce the amount of or postpone any fixed date for payment of any Obligation in
          which such participant has an interest. Any party to which such a participation
          has been granted shall have the benefits of Section 1.12 and
          Section&nbsp;9.3 hereof. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
          participant or prospective participant under this Section any financial or other
          information pertaining to the Borrower or any Subsidiary provided such
          participant or prospective participant agrees in writing to be bound by

          herein or in any other Loan Document, no such provision shall require the
          payment or permit the collection of any amount of interest in excess of the
          maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable law to be charged for the use
          or detention, or the forbearance in the collection, of all or any portion of the
          Loans or other obligations outstanding under this Agreement or any other Loan
          Document (<I>&#147;Excess Interest&#148;</I>). If any Excess Interest is
          provided for, or is adjudicated to be provided for, herein or in any other Loan
          Document, then in such event (a)&nbsp;the provisions of this Section shall
          govern and control, (b)&nbsp;neither the Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser

          the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have received hereunder shall, at the
          option of the Administrative Agent, be (i)&nbsp;applied as a credit against the
          then outstanding principal amount of Obligations hereunder and accrued and
          unpaid interest thereon (not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by
          applicable law), (ii)&nbsp;refunded to the Borrower, or (iii)&nbsp;any
          combination of the foregoing, (d)&nbsp;the interest rate payable hereunder or
          under any other Loan Document shall be automatically subject to reduction to the
          maximum lawful contract rate allowed under applicable usury laws (the
          <I>&#147;Maximum Rate&#148;</I>), and this Agreement and the other Loan
          Documents shall be deemed to have been, and shall be, reformed and modified to
          reflect such reduction in the relevant interest rate, and (e)&nbsp;neither the
          Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser shall have any action against the
          Administrative Agent or any Lender for any damages whatsoever arising out of the
          payment or collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
          for any period of time interest on any of Borrower&#146;s Obligations is
          calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this
          Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum
          Rate, the rate of interest payable on the Borrower&#146;s Obligations shall
          remain at the Maximum Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of
          interest which such Lenders would have received during such period on the
          Borrower&#146;s Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the
          Maximum Rate during such period. </FONT></P>

          LaSalle Bank has issued a $250,000 letter of credit on behalf of Mid America Re,
          Inc. for the benefit of the State of Vermont relating to the state&#146;s
          capital requirements for captive mortgage reinsurance companies. </FONT></P>

          Mid America Investment Services, Inc. (&#147;MAIS&#148;) has recorded on its
          books as of November&nbsp;30, 2005, an amount of $6,075,925 classified as
          A/P-Other. This relates to a property MAIS sold in 2000 (which had previously
          been REO of the Bank and had been contributed to MAIS), under an agreement in
          which the buyer assumed an industrial revenue bond obligation in the amount of
          $6,000,000. Mid America has issued a letter of credit guaranteeing the repayment
          of the IRB obligation and this letter of credit remains outstanding. Because Mid
          America provided an additional loan to the buyers for tenant improvements and
          remains contingently liable relative to the IRB obligation (pursuant to the
          letter of credit), for GAAP purposes, MAIS could not record this transaction as
          a sale. MAIS was required to keep the liability (including the deferred profit
          on the sale of approximately $83,000) on its books as well as the asset relating
          to the property of $6,000,000 (recorded as A/R-Other). </FONT></P>
