         PARITY DEBT CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of February 22, 2002, among STAR
GAS PROPANE, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, the Lenders (as defined
herein), FLEET NATIONAL BANK, as Administrative Agent, and BANK OF AMERICA,
N.A., as Documentation Agent.

         The Borrower (such term, and all other capitalized terms in this
paragraph, being used as hereinafter defined) has requested the Lenders to
extend credit to the Borrower in the aggregate principal amount of up to
$25,000,000 which Indebtedness shall constitute Parity Debt under Section
6.01(b) of the Existing Credit Agreement, Section 10.1(b) of the Note Agreement
and the comparable sections under the various Parity Debt Agreements. The
Lenders are willing to extend such credit to the Borrower upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein. Accordingly, the Borrower, the
Lenders, the Agents and the Issuing Bank agree as follows:

                                   DEFINITIONS

         "ABR Loan" shall mean any ABR Revolving Loan or ABR Term Loan.

         "ABR Revolving Loan" shall mean any Revolving Loan bearing interest at
a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the
provisions of Article II.

         "ABR Term Loan" shall mean any Term Loan bearing interest at a rate
determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the
provisions of Article II.

         "Acquired Business Entity" means (i) any business entity the capital
stock or assets of which have been acquired substantially as an entirety by the
Borrower by purchase, merger or, consolidation, and (ii) any other assets which
were operated as an identifiable business unit, i.e., a branch or division of a
business entity and which have been acquired substantially as an entirety by the
Borrower.

         "Adjusted LIBO Rate" shall mean, with respect to any Eurodollar
Borrowing for any Interest Period, the rate, rounded upwards to the nearest
1/100%, obtained by dividing (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period by (b)
an amount equal to 1 minus the Statutory Reserves, if any; provided, however,
that if any time during such Interest Period the Statutory Reserves applicable
to such Eurodollar Borrowing changes, the Adjusted LIBO Rate shall automatically
be adjusted to reflect such change, effective as of the date of such change.

         "Administrative Agent" shall mean Fleet National Bank, in its capacity
as administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder, and its successors in such
capacity.

<PAGE>

         "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean, with respect to each Lender,

such Lender.

         "Affiliate", as applied to any Person, shall mean any other Person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with
such Person, provided that (i) for purposes of this definition, "control"
(including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlled by" and "under

possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether as a general
partner or through the ownership of voting securities or by contract or
otherwise, (ii) as applied to the Borrower, the term "Affiliate" shall include
Petro Holdings, Petro, all Subsidiaries of Petro, the General Partner and the
Public Partnership, and (iii) no Person which is an institution shall be deemed
to be an Affiliate of the Borrower solely by reason of ownership of the Facility
Obligations or other securities issued in exchange for the Facility Obligations
or by reason of having the benefits of any agreements or covenants contained in
this Agreement or the other Operative Agreements.

determined (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that

including the inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain
sufficient quotations in accordance with the terms hereof, the Alternate Base
Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (a) of the first sentence of
this definition until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer
exist. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate

such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively,
without notice to the Borrower.

reasonable discretion to (A) provide for the proper conduct of the business of
the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries (including cash reserves for future
capital expenditures) or (B) provide funds for distributions under Sections
5.4(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) or 5.4(b)(i) of the MLP Agreement in respect of any
one or more of the next four quarters or (C) comply with applicable law or any
loan agreement (including this Agreement), mortgage, security agreement, debt
instrument or other agreement or obligation to which the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary is a party or its assets are subject, (including the
payment of principal, Make Whole Amount, if applicable, and interest) of the
Borrower in respect of the Notes; provided that Available Cash shall exclude,
without duplication, (w) in each calendar quarter a reserve equal to the
Specified Percentage of the aggregate amount of all interest in respect of all
Indebtedness of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries to be paid or to
accrue in the next quarter (assuming, in the case of Indebtedness incurred
hereunder, that such Indebtedness will bear interest at the then prevailing rate
for Eurodollar Loans of the applicable Class for one-month's duration, plus the
Applicable Margin for such Loans, and assuming in the case of other Indebtedness
bearing interest at fluctuating interest rates which cannot be determined in
advance, that the interest rate in effect on the last Business Day of the

All references herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be

time; provided, however, that, for purposes of (a) making any calculation
contemplated by the provisions of Article II and (b) determining compliance with

Borrowings, Loans, Letters of Credit and certain related terms hereunder may be
distinguished by "Class" and by "Type". The "Class" of a Loan or of a Commitment
to make such a Loan or of a Borrowing comprising such Loans or of a Letter of
Credit refers to whether such Loan is a Revolving Loan or a Term Loan, each of
which constitutes a Class. The "Type" of a Loan refers to whether such Loan is
an ABR Loan or a Eurodollar Loan. Borrowings and Loans may (but need not) be
identified both by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurodollar Revolving Loan" is a Loan
which is both a Revolving Loan and a Eurodollar Loan).

         Section 2.01 Commitment to Make Loans. (a) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (b) Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally
and not jointly, to make Revolving



                                       28

<PAGE>

Loans to the Borrower, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving
Credit Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not to exceed the excess, if any, of (i) such Lender's Revolving
Credit Commitment over (ii) its Letter of Credit Exposure at such time.

         (c) Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally
and not jointly, to convert the Revolving Loans to Term Loans by making a single
loan to the Borrower (each such loan, a "Term Loan") on the Conversion Date in a
principal amount not to exceed the sum of (i) the lesser of (A) the excess, if
any, of (I) such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment immediately prior to such
date over (II) its Letter of Credit Exposure immediately prior to such date and
(B) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Loans
immediately prior to such date and (ii) such Lender's pro rata share (based on
the percentage of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments represented by such
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment) of the aggregate Letter of Credit Exposure
immediately prior to such date.

         (d) The Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans

Section 2.01(b) and upon the other terms and subject to the other conditions and
limitations set forth herein, provided that subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth, at all times, the Borrower shall maintain Loans outstanding in
a minimum principal amount of at least $2,000,000 unless the Facility is
terminated through acceleration or otherwise. Amounts paid or prepaid in respect
of Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

         Section 2.02 Loans. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing
consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loan Commitments, as the case
may be; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall
not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it
being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender).
The Loans comprising each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount
which is (i) an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000 in the
case of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) an integral multiple of $100,000 in the case
of ABR Loans (or, in the case of ABR Loans, an aggregate principal amount equal
to the remaining balance of the Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loan
Commitments, as the case may be).

         (b) A particular Borrowing of any Class shall consist solely of ABR
Loans or Eurodollar Loans of such Class, as the Borrower may request pursuant to
Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option fulfill its Commitment with respect
to any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of
such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall
not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Note. Borrowings of more than one
Type and Eurodollar Loans bearing interest for more than one specific Interest
Period may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would result in
an aggregate of more than five separate Eurodollar Loans of any Lender being
outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of


                                       29

<PAGE>

the foregoing, Loans having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether
they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

         (c) Subject to Section 2.02(g), each Lender shall make a Loan in the
amount of its pro rata portion, as determined under Section 2.16, of each
Borrowing hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Administrative Agent in Boston, Massachusetts, not later
than 1:00 p.m., Boston time, and the Administrative Agent shall by 3:00 p.m.,
Boston time, credit the amounts so received to the general deposit account of
the Borrower with the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on
such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been
met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.

         (d) If the Administrative Agent has not received from the Borrower the
payment required by Section 2.21(g) by 12:30 p.m., Boston time, on the date on
which the Issuing Bank has notified the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
that payment of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit of any Class will
be made, as provided in Section 2.21(g), the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the Issuing Bank and each Lender of the Letter of Credit Disbursement of
such Class and, in the case of each Lender, its pro rata share (based on such
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Class) of such Letter of
Credit Disbursement. Not later than 2:00 p.m., Boston time, on such date, each
Lender shall make available its pro rata share, as so determined, of such Letter
of Credit Disbursement, in Federal or other funds immediately available in
Boston, to the Administrative Agent at its address set forth in Section 9.01,
and the Administrative Agent will promptly make such funds available to the
Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent will promptly remit to each Lender that
shall have made such funds available its pro rata share, as so determined, of
any amounts subsequently received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower
in respect of such Letter of Credit Disbursement.

         (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing, or prior to the time of any required
payment by such Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit Disbursement, that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's pro
rata portion of such Borrowing or payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on
the date of such Borrowing or payment in accordance with Section 2.02(c) or (d),
as applicable, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower or Issuing Bank, as applicable, on
such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall
not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender
and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or the Issuing Bank
(or, if the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank are the same Person, from
the date of such payment in respect of a Letter of Credit Disbursement), as
applicable, until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at,
(i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant
to Section 2.06 or 2.21(g), as applicable and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the
Administrative


                                       30

<PAGE>

Agent such corresponding amount in respect of a Borrowing, such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

         (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the Interest
Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Conversion Date. Any
Revolving Credit Borrowing which cannot be refinanced as a Eurodollar Borrowing
by reason of the preceding sentence shall be automatically converted at the end
of the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Revolving Credit
Borrowing. Further, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, nor shall any
Lender be required to make, any Eurodollar Loan during the existence of a
Default or an Event of Default unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree.

         (g) The Borrower may refinance (i) all or any part of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing with a Revolving Credit Borrowing of the same or a different
Type and (ii) all or any part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing outstanding on
the Conversion Date with a Term Borrowing of the same or a different Type, in
each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
in this Agreement. Any Revolving Credit Borrowing or part thereof so refinanced
shall be deemed to be repaid or prepaid in accordance with Section 2.04 or 2.12,
as applicable, with the proceeds of such new Revolving Credit Borrowing or Term
Borrowing, as applicable; and the proceeds of such new Revolving Credit
Borrowing or Term Borrowing, as applicable (to the extent they do not exceed the
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Borrowing being refinanced), shall not
be paid by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent or by the Administrative
Agent to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.02(c).

         Section 2.03 Notice of Borrowings. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent written or telecopy notice in the form of Exhibit I hereto
(or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing or by telecopy in the form of
Exhibit I hereto) (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., Boston time, two Business Days before a proposed borrowing and (b)
in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, on the
Business Day of the proposed borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall in each case refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the applicable Class
and Type of such Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day) and the amount thereof; and (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a
Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election
as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any
Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. If the
Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.03 of its
election to refinance a Revolving Credit Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, then the Borrower shall (unless
such Borrowing is repaid at the end of such Interest Period) be deemed to have
given notice of an election to refinance such Borrowing with an ABR Borrowing.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given
pursuant to this Section 2.03 and of each Lender's pro rata portion of the
requested Borrowing.

         Section 2.04 Notes; Repayment of Loans. The Loans made by each Lender
shall be evidenced by a Note, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the
Borrower, dated the Closing Date, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A with the blanks appropriately filled, payable to the order of such
Lender in a principal amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment.
The outstanding principal balance of each Loan, as evidenced by the applicable
Note, shall be payable (a) in the case of a Revolving Loan, on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and on the Conversion Date and (b)
in the case of a Term Loan, as provided in Section 2.11. Each Note shall bear
interest from the date of the first Borrowing hereunder on the outstanding
principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.06. Each Lender shall, and
is hereby authorized by the Borrower to, endorse on the schedule attached to
each Note delivered to such Lender (or on a continuation of such schedule
attached to such Note and made a part thereof), or otherwise to record in such
Lender's internal records, an appropriate notation evidencing the date and
amount of each applicable Loan from such Lender, each payment and prepayment of
principal of any such Loan, each payment of interest on any such Loan and the
other information provided for on such schedule; provided, however, that the
failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein shall not
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Notes.

         Section 2.05 Fees. (a) [Intentionally omitted].

         (b) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender, on the last day of March, June, September and December in each
year, and on the last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period, a
commitment fee (a "Commitment Fee") on the average daily unused amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender during the preceding calendar quarter
(or shorter period commencing with the date of this Agreement or ending with the
last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period), equal to (i) during any
Level I Pricing Period, 0.25% per annum, (ii) during any Level II Pricing
Period, 0.375% per annum and (iii) at all other times, 0.50% per annum. The
"unused amount" of the Revolving Credit Commitment of a Lender on any date means
the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment on such date, less the
sum of its outstanding Revolving Loans on such date and its Letter of Credit
Exposure on such date. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to
each Lender shall commence to accrue from the date of this Agreement and shall
cease to accrue on the last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period.

         (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter dated February 12, 2002 (the
"Letter Agreement"), among the Administrative Agent, the General Partner and the
Borrower, in the amounts and on the dates provided in the Letter Agreement. Such
fees shall be in addition to reimbursement of the Administrative Agents'
reasonable out- of-pocket expenses.

         (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

         Section 2.06 Interest on Loans. (a) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (b) Subject to Section 2.07, each Revolving Loan or Term Loan
comprising an ABR Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from the date such
Loan is made until it becomes due (computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
Base Rate, plus the Applicable ABR Margin.

         (c) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (d) Subject to Section 2.07, each Revolving Loan or Term Loan
comprising a Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest for each day from the date
such Loan is made until it becomes due (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing, plus
the Applicable Eurodollar Margin.

         (e) Any change in any Applicable Margin required hereunder shall be
deemed to occur (i) five Business Days after the date the Borrower delivers its
financial statements required by Section 5.02(a) or (b), as the case may be, in
respect of its most recent fiscal quarter and the certificate required by
Section 5.02(c) or (ii) on the date any Revolving Credit Borrowing is made or
any Letter of Credit is issued in respect of the financial statements required
by Section 5.02(a); provided that if the Borrower fails to deliver such
financial statements and certificate on or before the date such statements and
certificate are required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(a) or (b), as
the case may be, and Section 5.02(c), the Applicable Margin for the period from
such required date until the date such statements and certificate are actually
delivered shall be calculated as if a Level III Pricing Period were in effect,
and after the date such statements and certificate are actually delivered the
Applicable Margin shall be determined as otherwise provided for herein.

         (f) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment
Dates applicable to such Loan, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate for each Interest
Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined
by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

         Section 2.07 Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, by acceleration or
otherwise, interest shall accrue, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount during the period from (and including) the date of such default
to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before
judgment) at (a) in the case of principal or interest on any Loan, the rate per
annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of
360 days) that would otherwise be applicable to such Loan pursuant to Section
2.06 as if a Level III Pricing Period were in effect, plus 2.00% or (b) in the
case of any other amount, a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the rate applicable to
ABR Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 as if a Level III Pricing Period
were in effect, plus 2.00%. The Borrower shall pay all such accrued but unpaid
interest from time to time upon demand.


                                       33

         Section 2.08 Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have
determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
such Borrowing are not generally available in the applicable interbank market,
or that the rates at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining
its Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall,
as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telecopy notice of such
determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such
determination, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant
to Section 2.03 or 2.10 shall, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised
the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice
no longer exist, be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

         Section 2.09 Termination and Reduction of Commitments; Conversion of
Revolving Loans. (a) The Revolving Credit Commitments shall be automatically
terminated at 5:00 p.m., Boston time, on the Conversion Date.

         (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in
whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however that (i) the Borrower
simultaneously reduce Facility B pro rata such that at all times the Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage of each Lender hereunder and the Tranche B
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage (as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement) of the lenders under Facility B shall be the same, (ii) in the event
the Borrower permanently terminates or reduces Facility B in whole, the Borrower
shall simultaneously terminate or reduce, as the case may be, the Facility and
(iii) each partial reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments and Facility B
shall be in a minimum collective aggregate principal amount which is an integral
multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000.

         (c) In the event, and on each occasion, that the Borrower is required
to prepay or repay Revolving Loans and/or to provide cash collateral for Letters
of Credit as provided in Section 2.11(e) or (f) and Section 2.11(g), then on the
date of such required action, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal to the sum of such
required payment and cash collateral; provided, however that (i) the Borrower
simultaneously reduce Facility B pro rata in the amount of such prepayment or
reduction, such that at all times the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of
each Lender hereunder and the Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
(as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) of the lenders under Facility B
shall be the same and (ii) in the event the Borrower prepays the amount of
Facility B, in whole, the Borrower shall simultaneously prepay the Facility in
its entirety. In addition, in the event that the amount of any Excess Proceeds
referred to in paragraph (e) or (f) of Section 2.11 which is allocable to the
Facility Obligations exceeds the amount of all outstanding Loans and Letter of
Credit Exposure, the Commitments shall be further reduced by such excess, by
reduction, to the Revolving Credit Commitments. For purposes of applying the
requirements of this Section 2.09(c), the amount of any Excess


                                       34

<PAGE>

Proceeds referred to in paragraph (e) or (f) of Section 2.11 which is allocable
to the Facility Obligations shall be calculated as if the definition set forth
in the last sentence of Section 2.11(e) included, in addition, the maximum
aggregate amount of the unused Revolving Credit Commitments.

         (d) Each reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class in
accordance with this Article II shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class and
shall be made in the same proportion among the lenders in accordance with the
Tranche B Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, on the date of each
termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, the
Commitment Fees on the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class
so terminated or reduced accrued to the date of such termination or reduction.

         Section 2.10 Conversion and Continuation of Term Borrowings. The
Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent (a) not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, on the Business
Day of conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Term Borrowing into an ABR Term
Borrowing, (b) not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, two Business Days prior
to conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Term Borrowing into a
Eurodollar Term Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Term Borrowing as a
Eurodollar Term Borrowing for an additional Interest Period and (c) not later
than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, two Business Days prior to conversion, to convert
the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Term Borrowing to another
permissible Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

                  (i) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata
         among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts
         of the Term Loans comprising the converted or continued Term Borrowing;

                  (ii) the aggregate principal amount of such Term Borrowing
         converted into or continued as (A) a Eurodollar Term Borrowing, shall
         be an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000 or (B)
         an ABR Term Borrowing, shall be the lesser of (I) the remaining
         outstanding principal amount of such Borrowing and (II) an integral
         multiple of $100,000;

                  (iii) each conversion or continuation shall be effected by
         each Lender by applying the proceeds of the new Term Loan of such
         Lender resulting from such conversion or continuation to the Term Loan
         (or portion thereof) of such Lender being converted or continued;
         accrued interest on a Eurodollar Term Loan (or portion thereof) being
         converted or continued shall be paid by the Borrower at the time of
         conversion;

                  (iv) if any Eurodollar Term Borrowing is converted or
         continued at a time other than the end of the Interest Period
         applicable thereto, the Borrower shall pay, upon demand, any amounts
         due to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.15;


                                       35

<PAGE>

                  (v) any portion of a Term Borrowing maturing or required to be
         repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued as
         a Eurodollar Term Borrowing;

                  (vi) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, during the
         existence of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall not
         be entitled to elect to have any Term Borrowing converted into or
         continued as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing:

                  (vii) any portion of a Term Borrowing which cannot be
         converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing by reason of
         clause (v) or (vi) above shall be automatically converted at the end of
         the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Term
         Borrowing;

                  (viii) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar
         Term Borrowing that would end later than a Repayment Date occurring on
         or after the first day of such Interest Period if, after giving effect
         to such selection, the aggregate outstanding amount of (A) Eurodollar
         Term Borrowings with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such
         Repayment Date and (B) the ABR Term Borrowings would not be at least
         equal to the principal amount of Term Borrowings to be paid on such
         Repayment Date.

         Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be irrevocable and
shall refer to this Agreement and specify (I) the principal amount, the Type
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Term Borrowing, the Interest Period of the Term
Borrowing that the Borrower requests be converted or continued, (II) whether
such Term Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Term
Borrowing or an ABR Term Borrowing, (III) if such notice requests a conversion,
the date of such conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (IV) if such
Term Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Term
Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no Interest Period is
specified in any such notice with respect to any conversion to or continuation
as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one month's duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise
the other Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each
Lender's pro rata portion of any converted or continued Term Borrowing. If the
Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to
continue any Term Borrowing into a subsequent Interest Period (and shall not
otherwise have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to convert such
Term Borrowing), such Term Borrowing shall, at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically
be continued into a new Interest Period as an ABR Term Borrowing.

         Section 2.11 Mandatory Repayments and Prepayments. (a) [Intentionally
omitted].

         (b) On the Conversion Date, all Revolving Credit Borrowings shall be
due and payable to the extent not previously paid.

         (c) Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.11(h) and Section
2.12(b), the Borrower shall repay the Term Loans and reduce the Letter of Credit
Exposure in quarterly installments, commencing on December 31, 2003, and
continuing on the last day of every third


                                       36

<PAGE>

calendar month thereafter through September 30, 2005 (the due date of each such
installment being called a "Repayment Date"). The amount of any such installment
payable on a Repayment Date shall be the amount, if any, necessary (after giving
effect to any reductions on account of the expiration after the Conversion Date
of any Letters of Credit) to reduce the sum of (i) the aggregate principal
amount of the Term Loans outstanding immediately after the Conversion Date and
(ii) the Letter of Credit Exposure outstanding immediately after the Conversion
Date by an aggregate percentage of such sum equal to the percentage set forth
opposite such Repayment Date below:

                  December 31, 2003             12.5%
                  March 31, 2004                25.0%
                  June 30, 2004                 37.5%
                  September 30, 2004            50.0%
                  December 31, 2004             62.5%
                  March 31, 2005                75.0%
                  June 30, 2005                 87.5%
                  September 30, 2005           100.0%

On the Repayment Date that is September 30, 2005, Borrower shall repay the
remaining principal and interest owing on all outstanding Term Loans and fully
cash collateralize any then existing Letter of Credit Exposure. All payments
under this paragraph (c) shall be applied (I) first, to repay any outstanding
Term Loans and (II) second, after the Term Loans have been paid in full, to
reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure. Any such payments so applied to reduce the
Letter of Credit Exposure shall be deposited with the Administrative Agent
pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement as provided in Section 2.21(k).

         (d) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (e) If at any time the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
disposes of property or such property shall be damaged, destroyed or taken in
eminent domain or there shall be title insurance proceeds with respect to such
property, in any such case, with the result that there are Excess Proceeds, and
the Borrower does not apply such Excess Proceeds in the manner described in
Section 6.07(c)(iii)(B)(I), the Borrower shall prepay, upon notice as provided
in paragraph (g) of this Section 2.11 (which notice shall be given not later
than 180 days after the date of such sale of property), a principal amount of
the outstanding Facility Obligations equal to the amount of such remaining
Excess Proceeds allocable to the Facility Obligations, determined by allocating
such remaining Excess Proceeds pro rata among the Lenders, the lenders under the
Existing Credit Agreement and the holders of Parity Debt, if any, outstanding on
the date such prepayment is to be made, according to the aggregate then unpaid
principal amounts of the Facility Obligations, the Facilities Obligations (as
defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and Parity Debt (and the Make Whole
Amount on the principal amount of the Mortgage Notes to be prepaid). For
purposes of this Section 2.11, the aggregate then unpaid principal amount of the
Facility Obligations" under this Agreement shall equal the sum of (i) the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Loans and (ii) the Letter of
Credit Exposure.

                                       37

<PAGE>

         (f) In the event that damage, destruction or a taking shall occur in
respect of all or a portion of the properties subject to any of the Collateral
Documents, or there shall be proceeds under title insurance policies with
respect to any real property, all Net Insurance Proceeds (as defined in the
Mortgage), self-insurance amounts, Net Awards (as defined in the Mortgage) or
title insurance proceeds which, as of any date, shall not theretofore have been
applied to the cost of Restoration (as defined in the Mortgage) shall be deemed
to be proceeds of property disposed of voluntarily, shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 6.07(c) and, if subdivision (iii)(B)(I) of Section 6.07(c)
is applicable thereto, shall be subject to the prepayment provisions of
paragraph (e) of this Section 2.11; provided that, if any such event or
circumstances (individually or together with all other related events and
circumstances) shall result in proceeds of more than $25,000,000 in the
aggregate, the Borrower shall not apply such proceeds to replacement or other
assets or undertake any Restoration without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders.

         (g) The Borrower will give the Administrative Agent irrevocable written
notice of each prepayment under paragraph (e) or (f) of this Section 2.11 not
less than 10 days and not more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for such
prepayment, in each case specifying such prepayment date, the aggregate
principal amount of the Facility Obligations to be prepaid, the aggregate
principal amount of the Facilities Obligations (as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement) to be prepaid and the principal amount of each issue of Parity
Debt to be prepaid and the paragraph under which such prepayment is to be made.
Each Lender shall receive, on the Business Day immediately preceding the date
scheduled for any such prepayment, a certificate of a Financial Officer of the
Borrower certifying that the applicable conditions of this Section 2.11 have
been fulfilled and specifying the particulars of such fulfillment. Such
certificate shall set forth the principal amount of the Facility Obligations
being prepaid and specify how such amount was determined, and certify that such
amount has been computed in accordance with this Section 2.11.

         (h) All mandatory prepayments of the Facility Obligations under
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 2.11 shall be applied to pay or prepay
any outstanding Revolving Loans or Term Loans and, to the extent that the
remaining amount of such prepayment is greater than the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Loans, to reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure. All such
mandatory prepayments so applied on or after the Conversion Date shall be
applied to reduce the amount of scheduled payments due under Section 2.11(c)
after the date of such prepayment in the inverse order of maturity (without
affecting the requirement that such prepayments be applied first to pay all
outstanding Term Loans and only thereafter to reduce the Letter of Credit
Exposure). Subject to the foregoing provisions, any such mandatory prepayment of
Loans of any Class shall be applied to prepay all ABR Loans of such Class before
any Eurodollar Loans of such Class are prepaid. Any such payments under
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 2.11 so applied to reduce the Letter of
Credit Exposure shall be deposited with the Trustee and applied as provided in
the Trust Agreement.

         (i) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (j) In the event and on each occasion that the sum of (i) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans and (ii) the Letter of
Credit Exposure exceeds the

                                       38

<PAGE>

aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, the Borrower
shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans (and, to the extent that the amount of
such excess is greater than the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Revolving Loans, reduce the Letter of Credit Exposure by making a deposit with
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement as provided
in Section 2.21(k)) in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess.

         (k) Each payment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be
accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount paid to but excluding
the date of payment. The repayments and prepayments of the Loans required by the
respective subsections of this Section 2.11 and the optional prepayments
permitted by Section 2.12 are separate and cumulative, so that any one such
repayment or prepayment shall reduce any other repayment or prepayment only as
and to the extent expressly specified herein. All payments under this Section
2.11 shall be subject to Section 2.15, but otherwise shall be without premium or
penalty.

         Section 2.12 Optional Prepayments. (a) Subject to Section 2.01(d) and
Section 2.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing or payment due under Section 2.11(c), in whole or
in part, upon prior written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly
confirmed by written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent (i) in the
case of any prepayment of amounts payable under Section 2.11(c), not later than
11:00 a.m., Boston time, two Business Days in advance of the proposed
prepayment, (ii) in the case of any prepayment of Eurodollar Revolving Loans,
not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, two Business Days in advance of the
proposed prepayment and (iii) in the case of any prepayment of ABR Revolving
Loans, not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, on the Business Day of the
proposed prepayment; provided, however, that (A) the Borrower simultaneously
reduce Facility B pro rata, such that the prepayments made pursuant to this
Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(a) of the Existing Credit Agreement shall be in
equal dollar amounts and (B) each partial prepayment of ABR Loans shall be in a
minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 under each of Facility B and this Facility
and each partial prepayment of Eurodollar Loans shall be in an amount which is
an integral multiple of $100,000 under each of Facility B and this Facility and
not less than $500,000 under each of Facility B and this Facility, (C) in the
event that the Borrower prepays the lenders under Facility B with respect to the
term loans thereunder, in whole, the Borrower shall simultaneously prepay in
whole the Term Loans under the Facility and (D) a partial prepayment of a
Eurodollar Borrowing under this Section 2.12(a) shall not be made that would
result in the remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof under
each of Facility B and this Facility being less than $500,000. Each notice of
prepayment of any Borrowing or payment due under Section 2.11(c) shall specify
the prepayment date, the Class, the Type and the Interest Period of the
Borrowing to be prepaid (in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing), and the
principal amount thereof to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit
the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing or payment by the amount stated therein on
the date stated therein.

         (b) All prepayments under this Section 2.12 shall be subject to Section
2.15 but otherwise shall be without premium or penalty. All prepayments under
this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal
amount being prepaid to, but excluding, the date of payment. All prepayments
under this Section 2.12 of amounts payable under Section


                                       39


<PAGE>

2.l1(c) shall be applied to reduce the amount of scheduled payments of amounts
due under Section 2.11(c) after the date of such prepayment in the inverse order
of maturity (without affecting the requirement that such prepayments be applied
first to pay all outstanding Term Loans and only thereafter to provide cash
collateral in respect of Letters of Credit) until the last four of such
scheduled payments shall have been repaid in full, and thereafter all such
prepayments of amounts payable under Section 2.11(c) shall be applied to reduce
such remaining scheduled payments pro rata. Subject to the foregoing provisions,
any optional prepayment of Loans of any Class pursuant to Section 2.12(a) shall
be applied to prepay all ABR Loans of such Class before any Eurodollar Loans of
such Class are prepaid.

         Section 2.13 Reserve Requirements; Certain Changes in Circumstances.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of
law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the
principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any Fees
or other amounts payable hereunder (other than changes in respect of taxes
imposed on the overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which
such Lender has its principal office or by any political subdivision or taxing
authority therein), or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of or credit extended by such Lender (except any such reserve
requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or shall impose on
such Lender or the applicable interbank market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender, and the result of any of
the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender hereunder or under the Notes (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise) or Letters of Credit by an amount deemed by such Lender
to be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
upon demand such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

         (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the
date hereof of any law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation
or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or
any Lender's holding company with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Letters of Credit or
the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto to a level below that which such
Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies
and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or such Lender's holding company to
be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender upon
demand such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.


                                       40

<PAGE>

         (c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or amounts
as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company as
specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered
by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

         (d) No Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 2.13
for any costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date unless
such Lender shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand compensation
for such costs or reductions not more than 120 days after the later of (i) such
date and (ii) the date on which such Lender becomes aware of such costs or
reductions. Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to any other period. The
protection of this Section 2.13 shall be available to each Lender regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule,
regulation, guideline or other change, condition or circumstances which shall
have occurred or been imposed.

         Section 2.14 Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the
interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as
contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written or
telecopy notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender
may:

                  (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made
         by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for a
         Eurodollar Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request
         for an ABR Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently
         withdrawn; and

                  (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it
         be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans
         shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date
         of such notice as provided in Section 2.14(b).

In the event that any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii)
above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been
applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender
or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to
repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the
conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

         (b) For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the Borrower by any
Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day
of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all
other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the
Borrower.


                                       41

<PAGE>

         Section 2.15 Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of any
borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any
failure by the Borrower to borrow or to refinance, convert or continue any Loan
hereunder after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, refinancing, conversion or
continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10, (c) any payment,
prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other provision of
this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any default in payment or
prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest
accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether
by scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or
otherwise) or (e) the occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each
such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be
sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties
acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurodollar
Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount equal to the
excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of
obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed,
refinanced, converted or continued or not paid or prepaid (assumed to be the
Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of such
payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow, refinance, convert or
continue or failure to pay or prepay to the last day of the Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, refinance, convert or
continue, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the
date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined
by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds
so paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed, refinanced, converted or continued
for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be based upon the purchase
of debt securities customarily issued by the Treasury of the United States of
America which have a maturity date approximating the last Business Day of such
Interest Period). A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or
amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15
shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrower shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

         Section 2.16 Pro Rata Treatment. Except as required under Section 2.13
or 2.14 and by the terms of this Agreement requiring pro rata treatment with
Facility B, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any
Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment
Fees, each reduction of the Commitments, each payment in respect of
participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements and each refinancing of any
Borrowing with, conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing
as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class (or, if
such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the
respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans of the applicable
Class). Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any
Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion,
round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing, computed in accordance with
Schedule 1.01A, to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.


                                       42

<PAGE>

         Section 2.17 Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against
the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law or otherwise (except pursuant to Section 2.20),
or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of
any Loan or Loans as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans
of any Class shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of
the Loans of such Class of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously
to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay
to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in such Loans of
such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans
and participations in Loans of any Class held by each Lender shall be in the
same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans of such
Class then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans of such Class prior
to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to
the principal amount of all Loans of such Class outstanding prior to such
exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided,
however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made
pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the payment giving rise thereto shall
thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be
rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or
adjustment restored without interest (unless the party from which such recovery
is made is obligated by law to pay interest on the amount recovered, in which
case each of the Lenders shall be responsible for its pro rata share of such
interest). The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and
agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Loan deemed to have been so
purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such
Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to
the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

         Section 2.18 Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment
(including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other
amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 (noon),
Boston time, on the date when due in dollars to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, in immediately
available funds. Any such payment received after such time on any date shall be
deemed made on the next Business Day.

         (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a
Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or Fees, if applicable.

         Section 2.19 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this
Agreement, the Notes and the Letters of Credit shall be made free and clear of,
and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future
income, stamp, documentary, excise, property or other taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, assessments, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any



                                       43

<PAGE>

Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed
in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent, the
Documentation Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection
between the Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agent or such Lender and the
jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such
connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agent
or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or
received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement, the Notes or any Letters
of Credit). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges,
fees deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be
withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent, the Documentation
Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the Notes or any Letters of Credit, the
amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agent or such
Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative
Agent, the Documentation Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded
Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in
the amounts specified in this Agreement, the Notes and any Letters of Credit,
provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such
amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof if such Lender fails to comply with the
requirements of Section 2.19(b). Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by
the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the Documentation
Agent or such other Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the
Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agent and the Lenders for any
incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the
Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agent or any Lender as a result of any
such failure.

         (b) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof shall:

                  (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (A)
         two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service
         Form 1001 or 4224, or successor applicable form, as the case may be,
         and (B) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or successor
         applicable form, as the case may be;

                  (ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two
         further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date
         that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and
         after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent
         form previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and

                  (iii) obtain such extensions of time for filing and completing
         such Forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the
         Borrower or the Administrative Agent;


                                       44


<PAGE>

unless in any such case an event (including any change in treaty, law or
regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent. Such Lender shall certify (x) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that it
is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States Federal income taxes and (y) in the case of a
Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a participant
pursuant to Section 9.04 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer,
be required to provide all of the forms and statements required pursuant to this
Section 2.19, provided that, in the case of a participant, such participant
shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which
the related participation shall have been purchased.

         (c) The provisions of this Section 2.19 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Agent or any Lender.

         (d) Any Agent or Lender claiming any indemnity payment or additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or
document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or
change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity
payment or additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
sole determination of such Agent or Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.

         (e) Nothing contained in this Section 2.19 shall require any Agent or
Lender to make available any of its tax returns (or any other information that
it deems to be confidential or proprietary).

         (f) No Lender shall be entitled to claim any indemnity payment or
additional amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 with respect to any tax
unless such Lender shall have notified the Borrower that it will demand
compensation for such payment or amount not more than 120 days after the later
of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which such Lender becomes aware of the
costs or reductions giving rise to such claim. Failure on the part of any Lender
to demand any indemnity payment or any such additional amount with respect to
any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand
compensation with respect to any other period. The protection of this Section
2.19 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of
the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or
other change, condition or circumstances which shall have occurred or been
imposed.

         Section 2.20 Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances. In
the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice or certificate pursuant
to Section 2.13 or 2.14, or the Borrower shall be required to pay additional
amounts to any Lender under Section 2.19, the Borrower shall have the right, at
its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the


                                       45

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the provisions set forth in Section
9.04, including clause (v) of the proviso to Section 9.04(b)) all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement to another financial institution
designated by the Borrower which shall assume such obligations; provided that
(i) a similar assignment by such Lender be made under the Existing Credit
Agreement of all its interests, rights and obligations under the Existing Credit
Agreement, (ii) no such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule, regulation
or order of any Governmental Authority and (iii) the Borrower shall pay to the
affected Lender (and shall take the same actions under the Existing Credit
Agreement) in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the
entire amount of principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the
Loans and participations in Letter of Credit Disbursements made by it hereunder
and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder; provided
further that if prior to any such assignment the circumstances or event that
resulted in such Lender's notice or certificate under Section 2.13 or 2.14 or
demand for additional amounts under Section 2.19, as the case may be, shall
cease to exist or become inapplicable for any reason or if such Lender shall
waive its rights in respect of such circumstances or event under Section 2.13,
2.14 or 2,19, as the case may be, then such Lender shall not thereafter be
required to make any such assignment hereunder or under the Existing Credit
Agreement.

         Section 2.21 Letters of Credit. (a) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (b) The Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, for
the account of the Borrower, at any time and from time to time during the
Revolving Credit Availability Period; provided that any Letter of Credit shall
be issued only if, and each request by the Borrower for the issuance of any
Letter of Credit shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Borrower
that, immediately following the issuance of such Letter of Credit, the sum of
(i) the Letter of Credit Exposure and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Revolving Loans shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, provided, however, that the amount of
all outstanding Tranche B Letters of Credit (as defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement) and the Letters of Credit shall not exceed $12,500,000. Each Letter
of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the Maturity Date, unless
such Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date. Each Letter of
Credit shall provide for payments of drawings in dollars.

         (c) Each issuance of any Letter of Credit shall be made on at least two
Business Days' prior irrevocable written or telecopy notice (or such shorter
notice as shall be acceptable to the Issuing Bank) from the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank specifying, on the Issuing Bank's
standard form or on such other form as is acceptable to the Issuing Bank, the
date of issuance, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire, the
amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit, and such other information as may be necessary or desirable to
complete such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank will give the Administrative
Agent prompt notice of the issuance and amount of such Letter of Credit and the
expiration date of such Letter of Credit (and the Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice thereof to each Lender). The Issuing Bank also will give the
Administrative Agent (i) daily notice of the amount available to be drawn under
each outstanding

                                       46

<PAGE>

Letter of Credit and (ii) a quarterly summary indicating, on a daily basis
during such quarter, the issuance of any Letter of Credit and the amount
thereof, the expiration of any Letter of Credit and the amount thereof and the
payment on any draft presented under any Letter of Credit. The Administrative
Agent will promptly provide the Lenders with copies of each such quarterly
summary.

         (d) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further
action on the part of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
in respect thereof, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each
Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, effective upon the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Lender's pro rata share (based on such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage) of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, on
behalf of the Issuing Bank, in accordance with Section 2.02(d), such Lender's
pro rata share (based on such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage)
of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower when due in accordance with Section 2.21(g); provided
that the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any such payment with respect to
any wrongful Letter of Credit Disbursement made as a result of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Issuing Bank.

         (e) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to Section 2.21(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of
Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever (subject only to the proviso set forth in
Section 2.21(d)).

         (f) During the Revolving Credit Availability Period, the Borrower shall
pay to the Administrative Agent, on the last day of March, June, September and
December in each year and on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments
shall be terminated as provided herein, (i) for the account of the Lenders,
ratably in proportion to their Revolving Credit Commitments, a fee on the
average daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under all outstanding
Letters of Credit during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing
with the date of this Agreement) at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Eurodollar Margin from time to time in effect during such period pursuant to
Section 2.06 and (ii) for the account of the Issuing Bank, a fee on the average
daily aggregate amount available to be drawn under all outstanding Letters of
Credit during the preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the date
of this Agreement) at a rate per annum equal to 0.125%. Such fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360
days. Such fees shall accrue from and including the date of this Agreement to
but excluding the last day of the Revolving Credit Availability Period. In
addition to the foregoing, the Borrower shall pay directly to the Issuing Bank,
for its account, payable within 15 days after demand therefor by the Issuing
Bank, the Issuing Bank's customary processing and documentation fees in
connection with the issuance or amendment of or payment on any Letter of Credit.

                                       47

<PAGE>

         (g) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any
payment or disbursement made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, by
making payment in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent within
one Business Day after receipt of notice of such payment or disbursement, in an
amount equal to the amount of such payment or disbursement, plus interest on the
amount so paid or disbursed by the Issuing Bank, to the extent not reimbursed
prior to 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the date of such payment or disbursement,
from and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date the
Issuing Bank is reimbursed by the Borrower therefor, at a rate per annum equal
to the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans during such period pursuant to
Section 2.06. If the Borrower shall fail to pay any amount required to be paid
by it under this Section 2.21(g) when due, such unpaid amount shall bear
interest as provided in Section 2.07. The Issuing Bank shall give the Borrower
prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of Credit, provided that the
failure to give any such notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
any such amounts received by it to the Issuing Bank.

         (h) The Borrower's obligation to reimburse Letter of Credit
Disbursements as provided in Section 2.21(g) shall be absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:

                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
         Credit or any other Loan Document;

                  (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
         right which the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person may at any
         time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the
         Issuing Bank, any Agent, any Lender or any other Person in connection
         with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other related or
         unrelated agreement or transaction;

                  (iii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
         Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
         respect or failing to comply with the Uniform Customs and Practices for
         Documentary Credits, as in effect from time to time, or any statement
         therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
         against presentation of a draft or other document which does not comply
         with the terms of such Letter of Credit; provided that such payment was
         not wrongfully made as a result of the gross negligence or wilful
         misconduct of the Issuing Bank; and

                  (v) any other act or omission or delay of any kind or any
         other circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
         of the foregoing and whether or not foreseeable, that might, but for
         the provisions of this Section 2.21(h), constitute a legal or equitable
         discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

         (i) It is expressly understood and agreed that, for purposes of
determining whether a wrongful payment under a Letter of Credit resulted from
the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or

                                       48

<PAGE>

wilful misconduct, (i) the Issuing Bank's acceptance of documents that appear on
their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation,
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, (ii) the Issuing Bank's
exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit
as to any and all matters set forth therein, including the amount of any draft
presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the
beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any
document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient
in any respect (so long as such document on its face appears to be in order),
and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant
to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein
proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (iii) any
noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such
Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to
constitute wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank. It is
further understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the proviso to clause (iv)
of Section 2.21(h), the Borrower's obligation hereunder to reimburse Letter of
Credit Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Issuing Bank to the extent that such Letter of Credit
Disbursement actually discharged a liability of, or otherwise benefited, or was
recovered by, the Borrower; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed
to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any
direct damages suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's
gross negligence or wilful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.

         (j) The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof,
examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit, including as to compliance with the Uniform Customs and
Practices for Documentary Credits, as then in effect. The Issuing Bank shall as
promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by telex or
telecopy, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such demand for
payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make a Letter of Credit
Disbursement thereunder, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse any such Letter of Credit
Disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.21. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly give each Lender notice thereof.

         (k) In the event that the Borrower is required or elects pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement (other than Sections 2.11(h) and 7.01) to provide
cash collateral in respect of the Letter of Credit Exposure of any Class, the
Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent an amount in
cash equal to the Letter of Credit Exposure of such Class (or such lesser amount
as shall be required or elected hereunder). Any such deposit shall be held by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Cash Collateral Agreement. In
the event that the Borrower is required pursuant to the terms of Section 2.11(h)
or Section 7.01 of this Agreement to provide cash collateral in respect of the
Letter of Credit Exposure of any Class, the Borrower shall deposit such cash
collateral in an account with the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. Such
deposit shall be held by the Trustee in accordance with the Trust Agreement. Any
such deposit to be held by the Administrative Agent or the Trustee, as provided
herein, shall be accompanied by notice from the Borrower, in form satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent or the Trustee, as the case may be, setting forth
the basis for such deposit, identifying in reasonable detail the Letters of
Credit to which such deposit relates, and setting forth any other

                                       49


<PAGE>

information related to such deposit reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent or the Trustee, as the case may be. The Borrower shall promptly provide
the Administrative Agent with a copy of any such notice to the Trustee and shall
promptly provide the Trustee with a copy of any such notice to the Borrower.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to each of the Lenders that:

         Section 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and the Loan
Parties (a) is a limited partnership (in the case of the Borrower and the Public
Partnership) or a limited liability company or a corporation (in the case of the

to do business and is in good standing as a foreign limited partnership (in the
case of the Borrower and the Public Partnership) or a limited liability company
or corporation (in the case of the other Loan Parties) in all jurisdictions in
which the nature of their respective activities or the character of the
properties they own, lease or use makes such qualification or registration
necessary and in which the failure so to qualify or to be so registered would
have a Material Adverse Effect (and the only such jurisdictions are, in the case
of the Borrower and the Public Partnership, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois,
Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and West Virginia) and (d) has the power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the
Loan Documents and each other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby to
which it is or will be a party, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and, in the case of the Borrower, to obtain extensions of credit
hereunder.

         Section 3.02 Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of the Borrower and the Loan Parties of each of the Loan Documents to which
it is or will be a party, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and, in the case of the Borrower, the extensions of credit hereunder
(a) have been duly authorized by all requisite action and (b) will not (i)
violate (A) any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, or of the
agreement of limited partnership, operating agreement, articles of incorporation
or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Borrower and the other Loan
Parties, (B) any order of any Governmental Authority or (C) any provision of any
indenture, agreement or other instrument, including, without limitation, the
Existing Credit Agreement, the Note Agreement or the Parity Debt Agreements to
which the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties is a party or by which any
of them or any of their property is or may be bound, (ii) be in conflict with,
result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or

including, without limitation, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Note Agreement
or the Parity Debt Agreements or (iii) except for the Lien of the Collateral


                                       50

<PAGE>

Documents, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect
to any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or any
of the other Loan Parties.

         Section 3.03 Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document when
executed and delivered by the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties does or
will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of such party
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.

         Section 3.04 Consents and Governmental Approvals. No consent or
approval of, registration or filing with or any other action by (a) any
Governmental Authority, (b) any creditor, including, without limitation, any
creditor or holder under the Existing Credit Agreement, the Note Agreement or
the Parity Debt Agreements, or holder of any Capital Stock of the Borrower, any

Facility or the performance by the Borrower or any of the other Loan Parties of
the Loan Documents to which it is or will be a party, in each case except such
as have been made or obtained and are in full force and effect.

         Section 3.05 Business; Financial Statements. (a) As of the Closing
Date, the Business (as conducted by the Star Gas Group) does not include, and
has never included (whether conducted by the Star Gas Group or any of its
predecessors) the sale, distribution or storage of any petroleum derivative
product (other than propane gas and other than storage of diesel fuel and motor
oil used for vehicles of the Star Gas Group), except on premises listed on
Schedule 3.05(a).

         (b) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (c) The Borrower has delivered to the Agents the unaudited pro forma
balance sheet of the Borrower as of December 31, 2001. Such balance sheet
presents fairly the financial condition of the Borrower as of that date in
accordance with GAAP.

         (d) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders (i) the
balance sheet of the Public Partnership as of September 30, 2001] and (ii) the
combined balance sheets of Star Gas Group as of September 30, 2001 and the
related combined statements of operations and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended September 30, 2001, in each case audited by and
accompanied by the opinion of KPMG LLP, independent public accountants (the
financial statements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, collectively,
the "Audited Financial Statements"). The Audited Financial Statements present
fairly in accordance with GAAP the combined financial position and the combined
results of operations and cash flows of the Star Gas Group as of such dates and
for such periods. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.05(d), the balance sheets
and the notes thereto included in the Audited Financial Statements disclose all
material liabilities, actual or contingent, of the Star Gas Group as of the
dates thereof. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.05(d) and except for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date thereof
(none of which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse
Effect), the unaudited pro forma balance sheet of the Borrower referred to in
paragraph (c) above discloses all material liabilities actual or contingent of
the Borrower as of the Closing

                                       51

<PAGE>

Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing representation made in the two immediately
preceding sentences, such representation will be deemed breached (except for
purposes of Article IV hereof) only to the extent that such representation
involves undisclosed liabilities which could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Audited
Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto).

         Section 3.06 No Material Adverse Change. As of the Closing Date, there
has occurred since December 31, 2001, no material adverse change, and there
exists no condition, event or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change, in the
business, operations, property or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Star
Gas Group. Since the date of this Agreement, there has occurred no condition,
event or other occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, and
there exists no condition, event or other occurrence, that, individually or in
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.07 Title to Properties; Possession Under Leases. (a) The
Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries will own or hold valid leasehold
interests in all the properties and assets used in the operation of the
Business, except for properties and assets set forth on Schedule 3.07. None of
the properties and assets set forth on Schedule 3.07 is material to the
Business. Each of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries has good and
marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its properties and
assets, free and clear of Liens, except for (i) minor defects in title that do
not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or
to utilize such properties and assets for their intended purposes and (ii) Liens
permitted by Section 6.02.

         (b) Schedule 3.07 sets forth, as of the Closing Date, a true, complete
and correct list of (i) all real property owned by the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries; (ii) all real property leased by the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and (iii) the location and use of each such property.

         (c) Each of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries has complied
with all obligations under all material leases to which it is a party and all
such leases are in full force and effect. Each of the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all
such material leases.

         Section 3.08 Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.08 sets forth as of the Closing
Date a list of all the Subsidiaries, the respective jurisdictions of
organization thereof and the percentage ownership interest, direct or indirect,
of the Borrower therein.

         Section 3.09 Litigation; Compliance with Laws. (a) Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.09, there are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity
or by or before any Governmental Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower, any other Loan Party
or any business, property or rights of the Borrower or any other Loan Party (i)
which involve any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse

                                       52

<PAGE>

determination and which, if adversely determined, could be reasonably expected
to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party is in violation of
any law, rule or regulation, or in default with respect to any judgment, writ,
injunction or decree, of any Governmental Authority, where such violation or
default could be reasonably expected to result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.09,
neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party has received any written
communication during the past three years from any Governmental Authority that
alleges that the Borrower or any other Loan Party or the Business is not in
compliance in any material respect with any law, rule or regulation or any
judgment, writ, injunction or decree.

         Section 3.10 Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any of the other Loan
Parties is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any corporate
restriction that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
of this Agreement, neither the Borrower nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
is a party to any Material Contract and none of the assets or properties of the
Borrower or any Loan Party is or may be bound by any Material Contract.

         Section 3.11 Federal Reserve Regulations. (a) Neither the Borrower nor
any of the other Loan Parties is engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying Margin Stock.

         (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan and no Letter of Credit will be
used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or
ultimately, for any purpose which entails a violation of, or which is
inconsistent with, the provisions of the regulations of the Board, including
Regulation T, U and X.

         Section 3.12 Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company
Act. Neither the Borrower nor any of the other Loan Parties is (a) an
"investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Investment Company Act of 1940, (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 or
(c) subject to regulation as a "public utility" or a "public service
corporation" or the equivalent under any Federal or state law.

         Section 3.13 Use of Proceeds. (a) [Intentionally Omitted].

         (b) The proceeds of all Revolving Loans will be used solely (i) to fund
the purchase price of any Eligible Propane Acquisition by the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary or to reimburse the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary
for cash amounts paid by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary for the
purchase price of any Eligible Propane Acquisition made by the Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiary within the six-month period immediately preceding the date
of the Borrowing of the Revolving Loans to which such proceeds relate (provided,
in the case of an acquisition of Capital Stock, that the Person so acquired
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary), (ii) to fund Growth-Related Capital
Expenditures and (iii) for the other purposes set forth in Section 6.01(b) of
the Existing Credit Agreement, Section 10.1(b) of the Note

                                       53

<PAGE>

Agreement and the comparable provisions in the Parity Debt Agreement, including,
without limitation, to prepay, in whole, the Fleet Parity Note on the Closing
Date. The Letters of Credit will be issued solely to support obligations of the
Borrower incurred in connection with the acquisitions and Growth-Related Capital
Expenditures referred to in this paragraph.

         (c) The proceeds of all Term Loans will be used solely to refinance
Revolving Loans outstanding on the Conversion Date.

         Section 3.14 Tax Returns. Each of the Borrower and its Affiliates has
filed all tax returns required by law to be filed by it and has paid all taxes,
assessments and other governmental charges levied upon it or any of its
properties, assets, income or franchises which are due and payable, other than
(a) those which are not past due or are presently being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted for which such reserves or other
appropriate provisions, if any, as shall be required by GAAP have been made and
(b) in the case of any such Person other than the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, those which could not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower is a limited
partnership not subject to taxation with respect to its income or gross receipts
under applicable Federal laws. The Borrower is a limited partnership not subject
to taxation with respect to its income or gross receipts under applicable state
laws, except for laws of the states set forth on Schedule 3.14, none of which
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.15 No Material Misstatements. (a) No information, report,
financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any of its Affiliates to any Agent or Lender in connection with the
negotiation of any Loan Document or included therein or delivered pursuant
thereto contained, contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or
omitted, omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were, are
or will be made, not misleading. There is no fact known to the Borrower which
has or in the future would (so far as the Borrower can now foresee) have a
Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth in this Agreement
(including the schedules hereto).

         (b) All representations and warranties of the Borrower and Star Gas
Corporation set forth in the Note Agreement, the Existing Credit Agreement and
the Twelfth Amendment thereto, and other Parity Debt Agreements were true and
correct on and as of the date of such agreement and will be true and correct in
all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all material
respects on and as of such earlier date).

         Section 3.16 Employee Benefit Plans. Except as disclosed in Schedule
3.16, none of the General Partner, the Borrower or any Related Person of the
General Partner or the Borrower (other than Petro and any Subsidiaries of Petro
(except for the General Partner that is not a Related Person of the Borrower or
the General Partner as of the Closing Date)) has ever established, maintained,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to, and neither the

                                       54


<PAGE>

Borrower nor any Related Person of the Borrower has any liability or obligation
with respect to, any Plan. Neither the Borrower nor any Related Person of the
Borrower has assumed, either by agreement (including the Partnership Agreement
and the Operative Agreements), by operation of law or otherwise, any liability
or obligation with respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
or any other compensation or benefit arrangement, agreement, policy, practice or
understanding. Neither the Borrower nor any Related Person of the Borrower has
any liability or obligation to provide any amount or type of compensation or
benefit in respect of any employee or former employee of the Business which
relates to periods, services performed or benefits or amounts accrued prior to
the transfer of the Business or the Assets pursuant to the Operative Agreements
and the transactions contemplated thereby. Neither the General Partner, nor the
Borrower nor any Related Person of the Borrower, or the General Partner has
incurred any material liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Plan
and no event or condition exists or has occurred as a result of which such a
liability would reasonably be expected to be incurred. None of the General
Partner, the Borrower nor any Related Person of the General Partner or the
Borrower has engaged in any transaction, including the transactions contemplated
hereunder, which could subject the Borrower or any Related Person of the
Borrower to liability pursuant to Section 4069(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA. There has
been no reportable event (within the meaning of Section 4043(b) of ERISA) or any
other event or condition with respect to any Plan which presents a risk of the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Plan by
the PBGC. No prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406(a) of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) exists or has occurred with respect to any
Plan which has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject the General
Partner or the Borrower to a material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l)
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. No liability to the PBGC (other than
liability for premiums not yet due) has been or is expected to be incurred with
regard to any Plan by the General Partner, the Borrower or any Related Person.
Neither the General Partner, nor the Borrower nor any Related Person of the
General Partner or the Borrower contributes or is obligated to contribute or has
ever contributed or been obligated to contribute to any single employer plan
that has at least two contributing sponsors not under common control. The
Borrower is not, nor is it expected to become, a "substantial employer" as
defined in Section 4001(a)(2) of ERISA with respect to any Plan. Neither the
General Partner nor the Borrower has ever maintained or contributed to any plan
or arrangement which provides post-employment welfare benefits or coverage
(other than continuation coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code).

         Section 3.17 Environmental and Safety Matters. (a) Except as disclosed
in Schedule 3.17, each of the Borrower and the General Partner is in compliance
with all Environmental Laws applicable to it or to the Business, except where
such noncompliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has
timely and properly applied for renewal of all environmental permits or licenses
that have expired or are about to expire and are necessary for the conduct of
the Business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, except where the
failure to timely and properly reapply would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
Schedule 3.17 lists (i) all notices from Federal, state or local environmental
agencies to the Borrower, the General Partner or any Affiliate thereof citing
environmental violations affecting the Business that have not been finally
resolved and disposed of, and no such violation, whether or not notice regarding
such violation is listed on Schedule 3.17, if ultimately resolved against such
party, would have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) all current reports filed
by the Borrower, the

                                       55

<PAGE>

General Partner or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the Business with any
Federal, state or local environmental agency having jurisdiction over the
Business, true and complete copies of which reports have been made available to
the Lenders. Notwithstanding any such notice, except for matters the
consequences of which will not have a Material Adverse Effect, the Business is
currently being operated in all respects within the limits set forth in such
environmental permits or licenses and any current noncompliance with such
permits or licenses will not result in any liability or penalty to the Borrower
or the Subsidiaries or in the revocation, loss or termination of any such
environmental permits or licenses.

         (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.17, all facilities located on the
real property owned or leased by the Loan Parties which are subject to
regulation by RCRA are and have been operated in compliance with RCRA, except
where such noncompliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect and none of
the Borrower, the General Partner and their Affiliates has received, or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, been threatened with, a notice of violation of RCRA
regarding such facilities.

         (c) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.17, no Hazardous Materials are or
have been located or present at any of the real property owned or leased by the
Loan Parties or any previously owned properties in violation of any
Environmental Law, which violation will have a Material Adverse Effect, or in
such circumstances as to give rise to liability, which liability will have a
Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to such real property there has not
occurred (i) any release or threatened release of any such hazardous substance,
(ii) any discharge or threatened discharge of any substance into ground,
surface, or navigable waters which violates any Environmental Law or (iii) any
assertion of any lien pursuant to Environmental Laws resulting from any use,
spill, discharge or clean-up of any hazardous or toxic substance or waste, which
occurrence referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above will have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         (d) The Borrower has not received notice that it has been identified as
a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or any comparable state, local or
foreign law nor has the Borrower received any notification that any Hazardous
Materials that it has used, generated, stored, treated, handled, transported or
disposed of or arranged for transport for disposal or treatment of, or arranged
for disposal or treatment of, has been found at any site at which any
Governmental Authority or private party is conducting or plans to conduct a
remedial investigation or other action pursuant to any Environmental Law.

         (e) None of the matters disclosed in Schedule 3.17, either individually
or in the aggregate, involves a violation of or a liability under any
Environmental Law, the consequences of which will have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 3.18 Security Interests. The Trustee for the benefit of the
Secured Parties will at all times have the Liens provided for in the Collateral
Documents and, subject to the filing by the Trustee of continuation statements
to the extent required by the Uniform Commercial Code, the Collateral Documents
will at all times constitute a valid and continuing lien of record and first

under comprehensive general liability and workmen's compensation insurance
policies) and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with

improvements, repairs and additions to the Borrower's Assets, Section 6.01(f)
(but only to the extent such Liens comply with the requirements thereof),

acquired and, if required by the terms of the instrument originally creating
such Lien, other property which is an improvement to or is acquired for specific
use in connection with such acquired property, (ii) the Indebtedness secured by
any such Lien is permitted under Section 6.01(f) or (h) and, in the case of any

                  of the Trust Agreement and Section 2.11, and the Trustee shall
                  have received an Officers' Certificate from the General
                  Partner certifying that the consideration received for such
                  property is at least equal to its fair value (as determined in
                  good faith by the Board of Directors) and that such
                  consideration has been applied in accordance with the terms of
                  this Agreement; and

         Certificate from the General Partner certifying that such sale, lease
         or other disposition is in the best interest of the Borrower and will
         not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and any Restricted Subsidiary may
sell or dispose of (x) real property assets sold or disposed of within 12 months
of the acquisition of such assets and (y) all other assets sold or disposed of
within 6 months of the acquisition of such assets, in each case referred to in

6.07. The Lenders agree to take, at the expense of the Borrower, all actions
necessary to cause dispositions of Collateral made in compliance with this
Section 6.07 to be made free and clear of the liens created by the Collateral
Documents.

The Borrower will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its
partnership existence and its status as a partnership not taxable as a
corporation for Federal income tax purposes; (ii) the Borrower will cause each
Restricted Subsidiary to keep in full force and effect its partnership or
corporate existence; and (iii) the Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary to, at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect all of
its material rights and franchises (in each case except as otherwise
specifically permitted in Sections 6.06 and 6.07 and except that the partnership
or corporate existence of any Restricted Subsidiary, and any right or franchise
of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, may be terminated if, in the good
faith judgment of the


                                       84

<PAGE>

General Partner, such termination is in the best interest of the Borrower, is
not disadvantageous to the Lenders in any material respect and would not have a
Material Adverse Effect).

         (b) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, engage in any material line of business substantially different
than the wholesale and retail sale, distribution, and storage of propane gas and
related petroleum derivative products and the related retail sale of supplies
and equipment, including home appliances.

         (c) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates
to, take any action or refuse to take any reasonable action the effect of which,
if taken or not taken, as the case may be, would be to cause the Public
Partnership or the Borrower to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity other than a partnership for
Federal income tax purposes.

         Section 6.09 Payment of Taxes and Claims. The Borrower will, and will
cause each Subsidiary to, pay all taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges or levies imposed upon it or any of its properties or assets or in
respect of any of its franchises, business, income or profits when the same
become due and payable, but in any event before any penalty or interest accrues
thereon, and all claims (including claims for labor, services, materials and
supplies) for sums which have become due and payable and which by law have or
might become a Lien upon any of its properties or assets, and promptly reimburse
the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders for any such taxes, assessments,
charges or claims paid by them; provided that no such tax, assessment, charge or
claim need be paid or reimbursed if being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings promptly initiated and diligently conducted and if such reserves or
other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required by GAAP shall have
been made therefor and be adequate in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner.

permit any Subsidiary or Related Person of the Borrower to:

         (a)(i) engage in any transaction in connection with which the Borrower
or any Subsidiary could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant
to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, (ii)
terminate (within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA) or withdraw from any Plan in

to contribute to any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)
or other welfare benefit arrangement which provides post-employment benefits,
which cannot be unilaterally terminated by the Borrower, (iv) fail to make full
payment when due of all amounts which, under the provisions of any Plan or
applicable law, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Related Person of the Borrower
is required to pay as contributions thereto, result in the imposition of a Lien
or permit to exist any material accumulated funding deficiency, whether or not
waived, with respect to any Plan or (v) engage in any transaction in connection
with which the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Related Person of the Borrower
could be subject to liability pursuant to section 4069(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA,
if, as a result of any such event, condition or transaction described in clauses
(i) through (v) above, either individually or together with any other such event
or


                                       85

<PAGE>

condition, could result in (x) the imposition of a Lien on any assets or
property of the Borrower or any Related Person or (y) any liability to the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Related Person of the Borrower, which liability
could have a Material Adverse Effect; or

         (b) as of any date of determination (i) permit the amount of unfunded
benefit liabilities under any Plan maintained at such time by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary or Related Persons of the Borrower to exceed the current value of
the assets of any such Plan by more than $250,000 or (ii) permit the aggregate
liability incurred by the Borrower and any Subsidiary and Related Persons of the
Borrower pursuant to Title IV of ERISA with respect to one or more terminations
of, or one or more complete or partial withdrawals from, any Plan to exceed
$1,000,000.

As used in this Section 6.10, the term "accumulated funding deficiency" has the
meaning specified in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, the term
"current value" has the meaning specified in Section 3 of ERISA and the terms
"benefit liabilities" and "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" have the
meanings specified in Section 4001 of ERISA.

will maintain or cause to be maintained in working order and condition, in
accordance with normal industry standards, all properties used or useful in the
business of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries and from time to time

thereof.

         (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, keep its insurable properties adequately insured at all times
by Permitted Insurers; maintain such other insurance, to such extent and against
such risks, including fire and other risks insured against by extended coverage,
as is customary with companies in the same or similar businesses, including
public liability insurance against claims for personal injury or death or
property damage occurring upon, in, about or in connection with the use of any
properties owned, occupied or controlled by it; maintain such other insurance as
may be required by law or any Collateral Document; and cause each such insurance
policy to name the Trustee, on behalf of the Secured Parties, as an additional
insured or loss payee thereunder. The Borrower will permit the Agents and an
insurance consultant retained by the Agents, at the expense of the Borrower, to
review the insurance policies maintained by the Borrower on an annual basis and
will implement any changes to such policies reasonably recommended by such
consultant.

         Section 6.12 Operative Agreements; Collateral Documents. The Borrower
will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, perform and comply with all
of its obligations under each of the Operative Agreements to which it is a
party, will enforce each such Operative Agreement against each other party
thereto and will not accept the termination of any such Operative Agreement,
unless the taking of or omitting to take any such action would not have a
Material Adverse Effect and would not be disadvantageous in any material respect
to the Lenders. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any other Loan Party
to, amend, modify or supplement any Operative Agreement or its partnership
agreement, certificate of incorporation or by-laws without the prior written
consent of the Required Lenders; provided that (i) the MLP Agreement and the
Partnership Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented without


                                       86

<PAGE>

the prior written consent of the Required Lenders if such amendment,
modification or supplement would not have a Material Adverse Effect and the
Borrower shall have delivered to each Lender a copy of such proposed amendment,
modification or supplement together with an Officer's Certificate describing
such proposed amendment, modification or supplement and confirming that such
proposed amendment, modification or supplement would not have a Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) the Note Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented
without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders if such amendment,
modification or supplement may be made without the written consent of any
Lenders under the Trust Agreement. The Borrower will not, and will not cause or
permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any Material Contract,
or any amendment, modification or waiver in respect of any term or condition of
any Material Contract, other than any such contract or any such amendments,
modifications and waivers in respect thereof which could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 6.13 Chief Executive Office. The Borrower will not move its
chief executive office and the office at which it maintains its records relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents
or change its state of incorporation unless (a) not less than 45 days' prior
written notice of its intention to do so, clearly describing the new location or
state, shall have been given to the Trustee and each Lender and (b) such action,
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and each Lender, to maintain any security
interest in the property subject to the Collateral Documents at all times fully
perfected and in full force and effect shall have been taken.

         Section 6.14 [Intentionally Omitted].

         Section 6.15 Covenant to Secure Notes Equally. The Borrower covenants
that, if it or any Restricted Subsidiary shall create or assume any Lien upon
any of its property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other
than Liens permitted by the provisions of Section 6.02 (unless prior written
consent to the creation or assumption thereof shall have been obtained from the
Required Lenders), it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby
the Facility Obligations will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with
any and all other Indebtedness thereby secured so long as any such other
Indebtedness shall be so secured; provided, however, that the provision of such
equal and ratable security shall not constitute a cure or waiver of any related
Event of Default.

         Section 6.16 Compliance with Laws. (a) The Borrower will, and will
cause each Subsidiary to, comply with all applicable statutes, rules,
regulations, and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, the

municipalities, and of or by any Governmental Authority, including any court,
arbitrator or grand jury, in respect of the conduct of their respective
businesses and the ownership of their respective properties or business, except
such as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly
initiated and diligently conducted and if such reserve or other appropriate
provision, if any, as shall be required by GAAP shall have been made therefor or
the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.


                                       87

<PAGE>

         (b) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to,

in the aggregate with any other liability under any Environmental Laws.

promptly give notice to the Administrative Agent upon becoming aware of (i) any

in a manner and/or amount which could reasonably be expected to result in
liability under any Environmental Law, which liability would result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) The Borrower will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to,
promptly provide the Administrative Agent with copies of any notice, submission
or documentation provided by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary to the
Governmental Authority or third party under any Environmental Law if the matter
which is the subject of the notice, submission or other documentation could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Such notice,
submission or documentation shall be provided to the Administrative Agent
promptly and, in any event, within 30 days after such material is provided to
the Governmental Authority or third party.

         Section 6.17 Further Assurances. (a) At any time and from time to time
promptly, the Borrower shall, at its expense, execute and deliver to each Lender
and to the Trustee such further instruments and documents, and take such further

to time reasonably request, in order to further carry out the intent and purpose
of this Agreement and to establish and protect the rights, interests and
remedies created, or intended to be created, in favor of the Lenders.

         (b) Without limitation of Section 6.17(a), the Borrower will, and will

documents (including the execution, amendment, supplementation, delivery and

the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other statute, rule or regulation
of any applicable foreign, Federal, state or local jurisdictions, including any
filings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or similar foreign
office, which are necessary (or reasonably requested by the Agents), from time
to time, in order to grant and maintain in favor of the Trustee for the ratable
benefit of the Secured Parties a security interest in each item of the
Collateral of the type and priority described in the relevant Collateral
Document, perfected to the extent contemplated hereby and thereby.

         (c) Without limitation of Section 6.17(a), the Borrower will, and will

         Section 6.22 Certain Real Property. Without affecting the obligations
of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under any of the
Collateral Documents, in the event that the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary, at any time after the date hereof, whether directly or indirectly,
acquires any interest in any real property, including any fee or other ownership
interest in one or more properties with an aggregate cost in excess of $50,000,
or any interest under one or more leases of real property for a term in excess
of three years and involving aggregate average payments in excess of $100,000
per annum (each such interest, an "After Acquired Property"), the Borrower will,
or will cause such Restricted Subsidiary to, as soon as practical provide
written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, setting forth with
specificity a description of such After Acquired Property, the location of such
After Acquired Property, any structures or improvements thereon and an appraisal
or its good-faith estimate of the current value of such real property ("Current
Value"). The Administrative Agent shall provide notice to the Borrower of
whether the Required Lenders intend to cause the Borrower or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary to grant and record a Mortgage on such After Acquired
Property; provided, that no new Mortgage on such After Acquired Property shall
be required if the costs that would be incurred as a result thereof are
excessive in relation to the benefits that would be conferred thereby. In such
event, the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent a Mortgage, together with such of the documents or
instruments referred to in Sections 4.01(d) and 4.01(e) as the Agents shall
require. If, at any time, the aggregate cost to the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries of each interest in real property (x) acquired by the Borrower or
any Restricted Subsidiary, whether directly or indirectly, at any time after the
Closing Date, at a cost equal to or less than $50,000, (y) at such time, owned
directly or indirectly by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary and (z) for
which a mortgage in favor of the Trustee is not in effect (the "Aggregate Cost
of Unmortgaged Property"), exceeds $500,000, the Borrower will as soon as
practical, and in any event within 10 Business Days, provide written notice
thereof to the Administrative Agent, setting forth with specificity a
description of each such interest in real property, the location of such real
property and an appraisal or its good-faith estimate of the current value of
each such real property. The Administrative Agent may require the Borrower or
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to grant and record a mortgage in favor of
the Trustee on one or more of such real properties so that the Aggregate Cost of
Unmortgaged Property does not exceed $500,000, provided that no new mortgage on
any such real property shall be required if the costs that would be incurred as
a result thereof are excessive in relation to the benefit that would be
conferred thereby. In the event a mortgage is required, the Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a mortgage,
together with such documents or instruments as the Administrative Agent shall
require. In no event shall the title insurance policy for any such After
Acquired Property be in an amount which is less than the Current Value of such
After Acquired Property. Further, with regard to any interest in real property,
including any fee or other ownership interest in real property or any material
lease of real property, currently owned or held by the Borrower or any
Restricted Subsidiary and which is not being encumbered by a Mortgage of even
date herewith (each such interest, an "Existing Unmortgaged Property"), upon the
written request of the Required Lenders, the Borrower will, or will cause any
applicable Restricted Subsidiary to, execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent a Mortgage, together with such of the documents or instruments referred to
in Section 4.01(d) and 4.01(e) as the Agents shall require. In no event shall
the title insurance policy for any such Existing Unmortgaged Property be in an
amount which is less than the Current Value


                                       91

<PAGE>

of such Existing Unmortgaged Property. The Borrower shall pay all fees and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and expenses of any
customary environmental due diligence, and all title insurance charges and
premiums, in connection with the obligations of the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries under this Section 6.22.

         Section 6.23 Sale and Lease-Back Transactions. The Borrower will not,
and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into
any arrangement, directly or indirectly, with any Person whereby it shall sell
or transfer any property, real or personal, used or useful in its business,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, with an intent to rent or lease such
property or other property which it intends to use for substantially the same
purpose or purposes as the property being sold or transferred.

         Section 6.24 Acquisitions. Except as permitted by Section 6.07, the
Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, purchase, lease or otherwise acquire (in one transaction or a
series of transactions) all or any substantial part of the assets of any other
Person, except that (a) the Borrower and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may
purchase inventory in the ordinary course of business and (b) the Borrower or
any Restricted Subsidiary may engage in any such acquisition if no Event of
Default or Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of any such
acquisition or would occur immediately after giving effect thereto.

         Section 6.25 Impairment of Security Interests. The Borrower will not,
and will not permit any of the Subsidiaries to, take or omit to take any action,
which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing
the security interests in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties
with respect to the Collateral, and the Borrower will not, and will not permit
any of the Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person (other than the Trustee on
behalf of the Secured Parties) any interest whatsoever in the Collateral.

         Section 6.26 Limitation on Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends, etc.
The Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make any other
distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock, or pay any indebtedness
owed to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, (b) make loans or advances to
the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its properties
or assets to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, except for such
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of (i) customary
non-assignment provisions in any lease governing a leasehold interest or other
contract entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices or (ii) this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Note
Agreement.

         Section 6.27 No Other Negative Pledges. The Borrower will not, and will
not cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, enter into any agreement prohibiting the creation or assumption of
any Lien upon the properties or assets of the Borrower or any Restricted
Subsidiary, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or requiring an obligation
to be secured if some other obligation is secured, except for this Agreement,

Notes or the 2001 Parity Notes.

         Section 6.28 Sales of Receivables. The Borrower will not, and will not
cause or permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, sell with recourse,
discount or otherwise sell or dispose of its notes or accounts receivable,
except for accounts receivable consisting of assets of an operating unit sold as
a going concern in accordance with all other provisions of this Agreement.

         Section 6.29 Fixed Price Supply Contracts; Certain Policies. (a) The
Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, at
any time be a party or subject to any contract for the purchase or supply by
such parties of propane or other product except where (i) the purchase price is
set with reference to a spot index or indices substantially contemporaneously
with the delivery of such product or (ii) delivery of such propane or other
product is to be made no more than one year after the purchase price is agreed
to.

         (b) The Borrower will not amend, modify or waive the trading policy or
supply inventory position policy referred to in Section 3.29, except that the
Borrower may enter into Commodity Hedging Agreements as permitted under the
other provisions hereof. The Borrower will provide the Agents and the Lenders
with prompt written notice of any such new Commodity Hedging Agreement. Subject
to the foregoing exception, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
comply in all material respects with such policies at all times.

         Section 6.30 Certain Operations. The Borrower shall not permit Petro or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
to acquire a business which derives any revenues from the sale of propane if,
after giving effect to such acquisition, Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes (as
defined below) would equal or exceed the lesser of (a) 15% of the Borrower's
reported propane volumes sold for the most recently completed four fiscal
quarters which ended at least 90 days prior to the date of such acquisition and
(b) 15 million gallons of propane (such lesser amount, the "maximum permitted
amount"). If as a result of an acquisition, Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes
exceeds the maximum permitted amount, the Borrower shall not be in violation of
this Section 6.30 if within the period of 90 days following such acquisition the
Borrower causes Petro to complete the disposition of sufficient propane volume
to reduce Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes below the maximum permitted amount.
For purposes of this Section 6.30, "Petro's Pro Forma Propane Volumes" shall
mean the actual propane volumes sold by Petro and any of its Affiliates (other
than the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) for the most recently
completed four fiscal quarters which ended at least 90 days prior to the date of
determination plus the propane volumes sold of the propane business to be
acquired for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters which ended at
least 90 days prior to the date of determination. In addition, in the event
Petro or any of its Affiliates (other than the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) owns a propane business, the Borrower shall not permit Petro or
any such Affiliate to accept as a customer (except for de minimis, unintentional
and isolated acceptances) any Person who is (or was during the last billing
cycle of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries) a customer of the
Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) to maintain, books,

compensated directly from the bank accounts of the General Partner, the Borrower
and such Subsidiaries (other than Petro Holdings or its Subsidiaries) for
services provided by such employees, consultants and agents and, to the extent
any employee, consultant or agent is also an employee, consultant or agent of
Petro or any of its Subsidiaries, the compensation of such employee, consultant
or agent shall be allocated in accordance with clause (c) of this Section among

be named as a loss payee or additional insured on the insurance policy covering
the property of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Petro
Holdings or its Subsidiaries), or enter into an agreement with the holder of

interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the
Borrower accrued hereunder or under any other Loan Document, shall thereupon
become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any

other Loan Document, shall automatically become due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are

thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by
law or otherwise, and (ii) the Trustee and the Lenders may exercise any rights
or remedies in their respective capacities under the Collateral Documents in
accordance with the provisions thereof. In case of a default in the payment or
performance of any provision hereof or of the Loan Documents, the Borrower will
pay to each Lender such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the cost
and expenses of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and
disbursements, and any out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any such holder
incurred in connection with analyzing, evaluating, protecting, ascertaining,
defending or enforcing any of its rights as set forth herein or in any of the

exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice such Lender's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any other Loan Document upon any Lender
shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or
therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or

and each subsequent holder of any Note by its acceptance thereof, hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank to
take such actions as agent on behalf of such Lender or holder and to exercise
such powers as are specifically delegated to such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, by the terms and provisions hereof and of the other Loan
Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.

         (b) The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the
Lenders to, without hereby limiting any implied authority, and hereby agrees (in
the case of clause (ii) below, at the direction of the Required Lenders) to, (i)
receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on
the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to
distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (ii)

delivered by the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document as received by the Administrative Agent (other than
materials required hereunder to be delivered by the Borrower directly to the
Lenders).

         Section 8.02 Liability of Agents. Neither the Agents, the Issuing Bank,
nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, shall be
liable as such for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them,
except for such party's own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, or be
responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents
of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or
to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower or
any Subsidiary

Document. Neither the Agents nor the Issuing Bank shall be responsible to the
Lenders or the holders of the Notes for the due execution, genuineness,
validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Documents or other instruments or agreements. The Administrative
Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes hereof until it shall have received from the payee of such Note notice,
given as provided herein, of the transfer thereof in compliance with Section
9.04. Each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with written
instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or inaction
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders and each subsequent holder
of any Note. Each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Required Lenders
shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any
instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons. Neither the
Agents, the Issuing Bank nor any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents, shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of
the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its
obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in
performance or breach by any other Lender or the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
any of their respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document
or in connection herewith or therewith. Each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank
may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees,
shall be entitled to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder
and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts. None of Lenders identified in this Agreement as a "Documentation Agent"
shall have any obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Agreement in such capacity other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of Lenders so identified as "Documentation
Agent" shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that is has not relied, and will not rely, on
any of Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking action hereunder.

         Section 8.03 Action by Agents. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that none
of the Agents and the Issuing Bank shall be under any duty to take any
discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required
Lenders. The obligations of the Agents and the Issuing Bank under the Loan
Documents are only those expressly set forth herein and therein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Agent shall be required to take any
action with respect to any Default or Event of Default, except as expressly
required pursuant to Article VII.

         Section 8.04 Successor Agents. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor as provided below, each of the Agents and the Issuing
Bank (except, in the case of the Issuing Bank, in respect of Letters of Credit
issued by it) may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint
a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank,


                                      100


<PAGE>

as the case may be, may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor, which
shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as an Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent or
Issuing Bank and the retiring Agent or Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder. After the resignation of an Agent or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent or Issuing
Bank.

         Section 8.05 Agent and Affiliate. With respect to the Loans made by it
hereunder, the Letters of Credit issued by it hereunder and the Notes issued to
it, each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank in its individual capacity and not
as an Agent or the Issuing Bank shall have the same rights and powers as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent or the
Issuing Bank. Each of the Agents and the Issuing Bank (and its Affiliates) may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business
and transactions with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof
as if it were not an Agent or the Issuing Bank (or such Affiliate thereof).

         Section 8.06 Indemnification. Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse each
of the Agents and the Issuing Bank, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata
share (based on its Commitment hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the
benefit of the Lenders by such Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed
by the Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Agents, the
Issuing Bank and any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agents, promptly after demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and
against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in
its capacity as an Agent or the Issuing Bank or any of them in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action
taken or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower;
provided that no Lender shall be liable to any Agent for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Agent, the Issuing Bank or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents.

         Section 8.07 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will. independently and without
reliance upon the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this

be bound by the terms of the Trust Agreement and agree to execute an Agreement
of Parity Lenders hereunder and Supplement to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the closing of the Facility, the
administration of the Facility or any amendment, modification or waiver of the
provisions hereof or thereof or incurred by any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of the rights of the
Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, the Notes issued
hereunder or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including the reasonable
fees, charges and disbursements of (i) McGuireWoods LLP, counsel for the
Administrative Agent and the Documentation Agent, (ii) any third party
consultants retained to assist the Agents in analyzing any environmental,
insurance and other due diligence issues, (iii) any search and filing fees of
ChoicePoint or another company acceptable to the Lenders and (iv) in connection
with any such enforcement or protection, any other counsel for any Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender.

         (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Agents, the Issuing
Bank, the affiliates of any Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders, and their
respective directors, officers,

                                      106

<PAGE>

employees, agents and Controlling Persons (each, an "Indemnified Party") from
and against any and all losses, claims (whether valid or not), damages and
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Party may become
subject, related to or arising out of (i) the Facility and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their
respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (iii) the use of the Letters of
Credit or the proceeds of the Loans or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnified
Party is a party thereto. The Borrower further agrees to reimburse each
Indemnified Party for all expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of,
preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or
proceeding arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation to
indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Section 9.05(b) shall not apply in
respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final and nonappealable judgment
that such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted from such Indemnified
Party's wilful malfeasance, gross negligence or bad faith.

         (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Agents, the Issuing
Bank, the Lenders and the other Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
losses, claims (whether valid or not), damages and liabilities, joint or
several, to which such Indemnified Party may become subject, related to or
arising out of (i) any Environmental Laws affecting the Borrower or any other
Loan Party or its properties or assets, (ii) any Hazardous Materials managed by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party, (iii) any event, condition or circumstance
involving environmental pollution, regulation or control affecting the Borrower
or any other Loan Party or its properties or assets or (iv) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto. The Borrower further
agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Party for all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with
the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened
claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party under this Section
9.05(c) shall not apply in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability to
the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined by final
and nonappealable judgment that such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted
from such Indemnified Party's wilful malfeasance, gross negligence or bad faith.

         (d) In the event that the foregoing indemnity is unavailable or
insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless, then the Borrower will
contribute to amounts paid or payable by such Indemnified Party in respect of
such Indemnified Party's losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such
proportions as appropriately reflect the relative benefits received by and fault
of the Borrower and such Indemnified Party in connection with the matters as to
which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate and other equitable
considerations.

         (e) If any action, proceeding or investigation is commenced, as to
which any Indemnified Party proposes to demand such indemnification, it shall
notify the Borrower with reasonable promptness; provided, however, that any
failure by such Indemnified Party to notify

                                      107

<PAGE>

the Borrower shall not relieve the Borrower from its obligations hereunder
except to the extent the Borrower is prejudiced thereby. The Borrower shall be
entitled to assume the defense of any such action, proceeding or investigation,
including the employment of counsel and the payment of all fees and expenses.
Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
connection with any such action, proceeding or investigation and to participate
in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid
by such Indemnified Party, unless (i) the Borrower has failed to assume the
defense and employ counsel as provided herein, (ii) the Borrower has agreed in
writing to pay such fees and expenses of separate counsel or (iii) an action,
proceeding or investigation has been commenced against such Indemnified Party
and the Borrower and representation of both the Borrower and such Indemnified
Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate because of actual or potential
conflicts of interest between the parties (in the case of any Agent or Lender,
the existence of any such actual or potential conflict of interest to be
determined by such party, taking into account, among other things, any relevant
regulatory concerns). In the case of any circumstance described in clause (i),
(ii), or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel;
provided, however, that the Borrower shall not in any event be required to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus appropriate local
counsel under the direction of such separate counsel) for all Indemnified
Parties. The Borrower shall be liable only for settlement of any claim against
an Indemnified Party made with the Borrower's written consent.

         (f) The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Agent or Lender. All amounts due under this Section
9.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.

         Section 9.06 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan
Document and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each
Lender under this Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

         Section 9.07 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

         Section 9.08 Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of any Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or


                                      108

<PAGE>

discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
Section 9.08(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on
the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

         (b) None of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any provision
hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment or modification shall
(i) decrease the principal amount of any Loan, extend the Maturity Date or the
Conversion Date, extend any Repayment Date or any date for the payment of any
interest on any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof,
or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written consent
of each holder of a Note affected thereby, (ii) change or extend the Commitment
or decrease the Commitment Fees or Letter of Credit Fees of any Lender without
the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
reimbursement of a Letter of Credit Disbursement without the prior written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) permit the release of any material
amount of Collateral under any Collateral Document or permit the release of any
material guarantor from the Guarantee Agreements without the prior written
consent of each Lender, (v) increase the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders
without the prior written consent of each Lender, (vi) amend or modify the
provisions of 2.11(h), the provisions of Section 2.16, the provisions of
Sections 9.04(b)(v), (h) and (j), or any of the provisions of Article II
relating to the pro rata treatment between this Agreement and the Existing
Credit Agreement, the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the definition of
"Required Lenders" or otherwise change the percentage of the Commitments, the
percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes or the number
of Lenders which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any
action under any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, without
the prior written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of any
Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of such
Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable. Each Lender and each holder of a Note
shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this
Section 9.08 regardless of whether its Note shall have been marked to make
reference thereto, and any consent by any Lender or holder of a Note pursuant to
this Section 9.08 shall bind any Person subsequently acquiring a Note from it,
whether or not such Note shall have been so marked.

         Section 9.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein
or in the Notes to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate,
together with all fees and charges which are treated as interest under
applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), as provided for herein or in any
other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for,
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate
of interest payable under the affected Note


                                      109

<PAGE>

held by such Lender, together with all Charges payable to such Lender, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate.

         Section 9.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the other Operative Agreements and the Letter Agreement constitute
the entire contract among the parties relative to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Any agreement previously entered into among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof is superseded by this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, the other Operative Documents and the Letter Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements or
the Letter Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party, other than the parties hereto and the other Secured Parties, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents, the other Operative Agreements or the Letter Agreement.

         Section 9.11 Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

         Section 9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which
when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 9.03.

         Section 9.13 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         Section 9.14 Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury Trial. (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York, New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring
any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.


                                      110

<PAGE>

         (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any
New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York, New York. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

         (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

         (d) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each of the
Borrower, the Lenders, the Agents and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim arising out of or related to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

         Section 9.15 Legend. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
ESTABLISHES CERTAIN RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITY FOR THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE NOTES AND THE SHARING OF PROCEEDS THEREOF WITH CERTAIN OTHER SECURED
CREDITORS. COPIES OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED TO ANY HOLDER OF THE
NOTES UPON REQUEST TO THE BORROWER.

         Section 9.16 [Intentionally Omitted].
