Mr. W. Brian O'Hara, President
Fremont Indemnity Company
Fremont Compensation Insurance Group                            Agreed INITIALS
500 North Brand Boulevard                                              --------

Re:      Letter Agreement of Regulatory Oversight of Fremont Compensation
         Insurance Group

Dear Mr. O'Hara:

During the course of the financial examination currently being conducted by the
California Department of Insurance ("Department"); the Department has confirmed
unfavorable operating trends and significant deterioration in the statutory
surpluses at Fremont Indemnity Company and its subsidiary insurance companies
(commonly referred to as the Fremont Compensation Insurance Group and
hereinafter "Fremont"). However, the Department has also found that Fremont has
significant invested assets, including over $1 billion of investments in
statutory workers' compensation deposits, and the current capability to pay both
claims and operating expenses as those obligations come due. In light of those
positive factors and Fremont's desire to continue writing business (at a
significantly reduced level from its current calendar year 2000 writings
volume), the Department and Fremont have agreed to the following:

1.       The Department will appoint a Special Deputy Examiner to provide
         supervision and regulatory oversight on behalf of the Commissioner to
         Fremont. The Special Deputy Examiner, in consultation with the
         Commissioner and his staff, may retain other staff as provided by
         Insurance Code Section 733(g) to assist in that supervision and
         oversight. Costs for the retention of the Special Deputy Examiner and
         any other staff shall be borne by Fremont.

2.       Fremont shall not make any payment to, or engage in any transaction or
         enter into any agreement directly or indirectly with its parent company
         or any affiliated company, without the prior approval of the
         Department. The Department is aware of the existing Services and
         Investment Management Agreement between Fremont and Fremont General
         Corporation. No further payments shall be made under that agreement
         until the Department has again reviewed the agreement and specifically
         approved it. Any subsequent amendment or modification of the agreement
         shall be subject to prior Departmental approval if the effect of such
         modification or amendment would be to materially change the obligations
         or rights of Fremont or to increase payments from Fremont to Fremont's
         parent company or affiliated companies under the agreement.

3.       Fremont shall not make any dividend payment or other distribution to
         its parent company without the prior approval of the Department.

4.       Fremont shall not make any withdrawal of monies from its bank accounts,
         disbursement or payment outside the ordinary course of business in
         amounts exceeding 3% of its then aggregate cash and investments without
         prior approval by the Department.

5.       Fremont shall not incur any debt, obligation or liability for borrowed
         money not related directly to the ordinary course of business without
         prior approval by the Department.

6.       Fremont shall file statutory financial statements (balance sheet and
         income statement) on a monthly basis (except for quarter ending periods
         of March, June, and September for which Fremont shall continue to file
         regular quarterly statements) no later than 45 days following the
         month being reported upon.

7.       Fremont shall file by January 1, 2001, a detailed business plan which
         sets forth forecasted premium writings, losses and expenses, for year
         2001. The budget forecast shall be in sufficient detail to allow for
         monitoring of actual versus planned expenditures. Furthermore,
         forecasted new and renewal premium writings shall not exceed $400
         million. No later than 45 days following the month being reported upon,
         Fremont shall file actual results (in a format approved by the
         Department) with a comparison to the budgeted amounts and relevant
         explanations for material variances.

8.       Fremont shall not enter into any new material reinsurance agreement nor
         amend in any material respect any existing material reinsurance
         agreement without prior approval by the Department; provided, however,
         Fremont may continue to renew existing reinsurance arrangements.

9.       Fremont shall not add any individual who is not currently a senior
         executive officer of Fremont, or one of its affiliates, to the board of
         directors of Fremont without first notifying the Department. The
         Department reserves the right to require the resignation of members of
         the boards of directors and senior executive officers of the insurance
         companies and shall have the right to prior review and approve any new
         appointments by Fremont to such positions.

10.      Fremont shall not change the terms of any written plans for
         remuneration, consulting, deferred Compensation or bonus plans for
         directors, officers and employees of Fremont without first obtaining
         the approval of the Department. Fremont shall also advise the
         Department of any such changes made since December 31, 1999.

11.      Fremont shall not enter into any new agreement nor revise any existing
         agreement for any form of current or future remuneration or other
         compensation, including severance agreements (other than severance
         agreements documenting terminations under existing plans, policies and
         agreements) for services rendered to Fremont by employees of Fremont,
         without the prior approval of the Department. Fremont shall also advise
         the Department of any such new agreements entered into or revisions to
         existing agreements made since December 31, 1999.

12.      Other than security interests granted in connection with repurchase
         agreements acquired in the ordinary course of business, Fremont shall
         not pledge nor assign any of its assets to secure indebtedness for
         borrowed money without prior approval by the Department.

13.      Fremont shall provide to the Department any additional reports that the
         Department reasonably determines are necessary to ascertain the
         financial condition of Fremont.

14.      Fremont shall not pay any fees related to the non-consummation of any
         material agreement without the consent of the Department.

15.      Fremont shall obtain a resolution from the Board of Directors of each
         of its insurance companies which consents to the terms of this
         agreement, and requests W. Brian O'Hara, President of Fremont
         Indemnity Company, to execute the agreement on its behalf.

16.      The Department reserves the right to amend or supplement this
         agreement, in good faith and its sole discretion, as deemed necessary.

17.      This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until a) the
         Department provides written notice to Fremont that it is released from
         the obligations required herein or b) the agreement is superceded by a
         Department Administrative Order or a Superior Court Order.

18.      If Fremont breaches this agreement in any material way, or if the
         Department, in good faith, determines that the provisions of this
         agreement, including any amendments or supplements, are no longer
         adequate to protect policyholders from financial hazard, it is hereby
         agreed by Fremont and its direct and indirect parent companies that
         they shall not oppose appropriate and lawful Department Administrative
         Orders or Applications for Superior Court Orders. Fremont and its
         direct and indirect parent companies hereby acknowledge that the
         Department has no duty to provide prior notice of such Orders and
         Applications, except as provided for by law.

19.      Fremont General Corporation shall contribute $6 million cash to Fremont
         during each of the calendar years 2001 - 2005 no later than March 1 of
         each year.

20.      All documents and copies thereof obtained by or disclosed to the
         Department pursuant to this agreement shall be kept strictly
         confidential by the Department, except that the Department may share
         such information and documents with other state regulators pursuant to
         a confidentiality agreement. This provision does not apply to documents
         already deemed public by law or revelation, e.g., quarterly financial
         statements.
