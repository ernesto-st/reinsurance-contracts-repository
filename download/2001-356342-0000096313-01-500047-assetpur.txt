herein as the "Purchase Price").

                  Section 2.6 General Price  Adjustments.  The Purchase Price is

                           (a) For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the term "Net
Assets" shall mean, as of the date  immediately  preceding the Closing Date, the
total assets of the Business,  which total net assets shall equal: (i) the gross
assets of the Business,  (without taking into  consideration any depreciation or

                           (c) Within  sixty (60) days after the  Closing  Date,
Seller  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  (the  date of  such  delivery  being  the
"Adjustment Date"), a statement of the Net Assets (the "Statement of the Closing
Date Net Assets" or  "Statement"),  which Statement shall (i) have been prepared
by Seller and Seller's  auditors,  Tanner+Co,  or such other firm of independent
certified public accountants appointed by Seller for this purpose) in accordance
with GAAP consistently  applied, and (ii) set forth the Net Assets (the "Closing
Date Net  Assets").  In rendering  the Statement of the Closing Date Net Assets,
Seller and its auditors shall permit Parent,  Purchaser and their  auditors,  at
the  earliest  practicable  date,  access to and  copies of the work  papers and
calculations related thereto.

                           (d) Any dispute which may arise between Purchaser and
Seller as to the Closing  Date Net Assets  shall be  resolved  in the  following
manner:

                                   (i) If Purchaser  disputes the calculation of
         the Closing  Date Net Assets or any portion  thereof,  Purchaser  shall
         notify Seller within thirty (30) days after the  Adjustment  Date,  and
         shall  specify  therein in  reasonable  detail the basis and reason for
         such dispute and the amount which is in dispute;

                                   (ii)   During  the  thirty  (30)  day  period
         following  the date of such notice,  Purchaser and Seller shall attempt
         to  resolve  such  dispute.  In  attempting  to resolve  such  dispute,
         Purchaser and its auditors shall permit Seller and its auditors, at the
         earliest  practicable date, access to and copies of the work papers and
         calculations  related  thereto of  Purchaser  which  Purchaser  used to
         determine the Closing Date Net Assets; and

                                   (iii)  If at the end of the  thirty  (30) day
         period  specified in clause (ii) above the parties shall have failed to
         reach  agreement  with  respect to such  dispute,  the matter  shall be
         referred to such accounting firm, which will be different than the firm
         currently used by each of Seller,  Parent or Purchaser,  of independent
         certified  public  accountants  as  the  parties  mutually  agree  (the
         "Independent   Accounting   Firm")  for  resolution.   The  Independent
         Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every  reasonable  effort to

                                       26
<PAGE>

         perform such services  within thirty (30) days of the  submission to it
         of the  Statement  of the Closing  Date Net Assets and related  dispute
         and, in any case,  as soon as practica ble after such  submission.  The
         fees,  costs and expenses  related to the  Independent  Accounting Firm
         shall be shared  equally by Purchaser  and Seller.  This  provision for
         Independent  Accounting Firm shall be  specifically  enforceable by the
         parties  and  the  decision  of  the  Independent  Accounting  Firm  in
         accordance  herewith  shall be final and  binding and there shall be no
         right of appeal therefrom.

                           (e)  Within  twenty  (20) days after the later of (i)
the  Adjustment  Date,  (ii) the date of the  settlement  of any dispute made in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.6(d)(ii) above, or (iii) the date of
the decision of the  Independent  Accounting Firm in connection with any dispute
made in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.6(d)(iii) above and provided
that the  difference is greater than $400,000 (four hundred  thousand  dollars):
Seller shall  reimburse  Purchaser,  by wire transfer of  immediately  available
funds,  to such bank as indicated by Purchaser in an amount by which the Closing
Date Net  Assets  (without  giving  effect  to any  change  in  depreciation  or
amortization  from June 30,  2000  through  the  Closing  Date) is less than the
Target Net Assets minus $400,000.

                  Section  2.7  Accounts   Receivable  Price  Adjustments.   The
Purchase Price is also subject to adjustment to be determined as follows:

                           (a) Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial efforts
in the ordinary  course of business (not  including  litigation)  to collect the
Accounts  Receivable  of the Domestic  Business.  All payments from any customer
shall first be credited to the Original Accounts  Receivable (as defined) unless
a customer  expresses  specific  disputes with respect to an outstanding bill or
invoice, which dispute shall then be immediately brought to the attention of the
Seller. For purposes of this Agreement,  the term "Original Accounts Receivable"
shall mean,  the total  Accounts  Receivables  of the  Domestic  Business  which
constitute  a part of the Assets as of the Closing  Date.  For  purposes of this
Agreement,  the term "Final  Uncollected  Accounts  Receivable"  shall mean, the
total Accounts  Receivables of the Domestic  Business which constitute a part of
the Assets which have not been collected in full by Purchaser as of the date two
hundred and forty days from the Closing Date.

                           (b) The parties have heretofore  mutually agreed that
the reserves shall be $153,000 (the "Reserve")

                           (c) Within two hundred and sixty (260) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller (the date of such delivery being
the "Account  Receivable  Adjustment Date"), a statement setting forth the Final
Uncollected Accounts Receivable (the "Statement of Accounts Receivable"),  which
Statement of Accounts  Receivable  shall (i) have been  prepared by Purchaser in
accordance  with  GAAP  consistently  applied,  and (ii)  set  forth  the  Final
Uncollected  Accounts  Receivable.   In  rendering  the  Statement  of  Accounts
Receivable,  Purchaser and its auditor shall permit Seller and its auditors,  at
the  earliest  practicable  date,  access to and  copies of the work  papers and
calculations related thereto.

                           (d) Any dispute which may arise between Purchaser and
Seller as to the  Statement  of  Accounts  Receivable  shall be  resolved in the
following manner:

                                   (i) If Seller disputes the Final  Uncollected
         Accounts  Receivable  or  any  portion  thereof,  Seller  shall  notify
         Purchaser  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  Accounts  Receivable
         Adjustment  Date,  and shall specify  therein in reasonable  detail the
         basis and reason for such dispute and the amount which is in dispute;

                                   (ii)   During  the  thirty  (30)  day  period
         following  the date of such notice,  Purchaser and Seller shall attempt
         to resolve such dispute; and

                                   (iii)  If at the end of the  thirty  (30) day
         period  specified in clause (ii) above the parties shall have failed to
         reach  agreement  with  respect to such  dispute,  the matter  shall be
         referred  to  the  Independent  Accounting  Firm  for  resolution.  The
         Independent   Account  ing  Firm  shall  be  instructed  to  use  every
         reasonable  effort to perform such services  within thirty (30) days of
         the  submission  to it of the  Statement  of  Accounts  Receivable  and
         related  dispute and, in any case,  as soon as  practicable  after such
         submission.  The fees,  costs and expenses  related to the  Independent
         Accounting  Firm shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller.  This
         provision  for  Independent   Accounting  Firm  shall  be  specifically
         enforceable  by  the  parties  and  the  decision  of  the  Independent
         Accounting  Firm in accordance  herewith shall be final and binding and
         there shall be no right of appeal therefrom.

Property that might curtail or interfere with the use of such property.  Neither
the whole nor any portion of the Real Property nor any other Asset is subject to
any governmental decree or order to be sold or is being condemned,  expropriated
or  otherwise  taken  by  any  public  authority  with  or  without  payment  of
compensation therefor, nor to the Knowledge of Seller has any such condemnation,
expropriation  or  taking  been  proposed.   Neither  Seller  nor  any  Business

of  occupancy,  licenses,  easements  and  rights  of way,  including  proofs of
dedication, required to use and operate the Real Property in the manner in which
the Real Property is currently being used and operated. True and complete copies
of all such  certificates,  permits  and  licenses to the extent they are in the
possession  of Seller or its  Subsidiaries  have  heretofore  been  furnished to
Purchaser.  Each of Seller  (with  respect to the  Business)  and each  Business
Subsidiary  has all  approvals,  permits  and  licenses  (including  any and all
environmental  permits)  necessary  to own  or  operate  the  Real  Property  as
currently owned and operated, and no such approvals, permits or licenses will be
required,  as a result of the Transac tions,  to be issued after the date hereof
in order to  permit  Purchaser  and the  Business  Subsidiaries,  following  the
Closing,  to continue to own or operate the Real  Property in the same manner as

estate created by each Lease is free and clear of all Encumbrances. There are no
existing  defaults  by Seller  or to the  Knowledge  of  Seller by any  Business
Subsidiary, under any of the Leases. No event has occurred that (whether with or
without notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other event)
would constitute a default under any Lease. Seller has no reason to believe that
any lessor under any Lease will not consent (where such consent is necessary) to
the consummation of the Transactions  without  requiring any modification of the
rights or obligations of the lessee thereunder.

formal plan,  whether legally binding or not, to create any additional  employee
benefit  plan or modify or change  any  existing  Plan  that  would  affect  any

each agreement creating or modifying any related trust or other funding vehicle,

incurred any liability  under Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA that has
not been  satisfied in full and neither the Seller nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has
maintained,  sponsored or been required to make  contributions to a Plan that is
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA.

                           (d) Neither Seller (with respect to the Business) nor
any ERISA  Affiliate,  nor any Plan, nor any trust  thereunder,  nor to Seller's

respect to a Plan  pursuant to which either a civil penalty under Section 409 or
Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax under Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code could be
imposed  on  Purchaser,   Purchaser's   Subsidiary  or  any  Seller's  Purchased
Subsidiary.

Purchased  Subsidiary  intended to be "qualified"  within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code is so qualified,  and the trusts  maintained  thereunder  are
exempt from  taxation  under Section  501(a) of the Code.  Each Plan intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) has satisfied such requirements.

beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by Applicable  Law, (ii) death  benefits  under any "pension  plan," or
(iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee

Business  Subsidiary for severance pay,  unemployment  compensation or any other
payment   related  to   termination  of  employment  or   consummation   of  the
Transactions,  except as expressly provided in this Agreement or, in the case of
Seller's  Foreign  Subsidiaries,  under  Applicable Law. The consummation of the
Transactions  will not,  either  alone or in  combination  with  another  event,
accelerate  the time of  payment  or  vesting,  or  increase  the  amount of any
compensation  under any Plan which  covers  employees  of Seller of any Seller's
Purchased Subsidiary.

         each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign
         Plan funded through  insurance or the book reserve  established for any
         Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
         procure or  provide  for the  accrued  benefit  obligations,  as of the
         Closing Date,  with respect to all current and former  participants  in
         such plan according to the actuarial  assumptions  and valuations  most
         recently used to determine employer  contributions to such Foreign Plan
         and no  transaction  contemplated  by this  Agreement  shall cause such
         assets  or  insurance   obligations   to  be  less  than  such  benefit
         obligations;  and there has been no  material  change in the  financial
         condition of any funded Foreign Plan from that shown in the last annual
         or actuarial report;

         respect of any Foreign Plan under any Applicable Law;

                                   (iv)  there  are no  pending,  threatened  or

they may from time to time  reasonably  request.  Each  party  will  direct  its
employees to render any assistance which the other party may reasonably  request
in examining or utilizing records referred to in this Section 6.2.

                           (b) On and after the Closing,  during normal business
hours, Seller will permit each of Parent, Purchaser,  Purchaser's Subsidiary and
their authorized representatives,  to have access to and examine and make copies

                           (c)  Parent,  Purchaser  and  Purchaser's  Subsidiary

parties or to defend or prepare for the defense of any claim  against  Seller or

                                       68
<PAGE>

to prosecute or prepare for the  prosecution  of claims against third parties by

any of its Affiliates.

                           (d) Each party  agrees  not to  destroy  any files or

                           (e) Parent,  Purchaser,  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  and
their  authorized   representatives   (including  its  designated  engineers  or

Subsidiary deem necessary or appropriate in their sole and absolute  discretion,
the  environmental  condition  of  such  properties  or the  business  conducted
thereat.  Such  investigation  may  include,  but need not be  limited  to,  the
performance of soil and surface or ground water sampling, monitoring, borings or

inspections  or  other  procedures  relating  to  environmental   conditions  or

Purchaser's  Subsidiary and their authorized  representatives in conducting such
investigation,  shall allow Parent, Purchaser,  Purchaser's Subsidiary and their

environmental  matters in  respect of the  Business.  Purchaser  shall  restore,
repair or replace Assets that are damaged or destroyed, other than ordinary wear

                           (f) Any information  regarding the Business or Assets
heretofore  or hereafter  obtained  from Seller or its  Subsidiaries  by Parent,
Purchaser,  Purchaser's  Subsidiary or their representatives shall be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality  Agreement,  and such information shall be held
by  Parent,  Purchaser,  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  and their  representatives  in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality  Agreement  provided,  however,

shall not prohibit  Parent,  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary from using and
providing  to third  parties  such  information  concerning  the  Assets  or the
Business as it may deem  appropriate.  The foregoing shall not preclude  Parent,
Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  from (i) the use or  disclosure  of such
information   which  currently  is  known  generally  to  the  public  or  which
subsequently has come into the public domain, other than by way of disclosure in
violation of this Agreement, (ii) the use or disclosure of such information that
becomes  available to Parent,  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  on a non-
confidential   basis  from  a  source   other  than   Seller  or  the   Seller's
representatives,  provided  that  such  source  is not  known  by  Purchaser  or
Purchaser's  Subsidiary to have a legal obligation prohibiting the disclosure of
such information, or (iii) the disclosure of such information required by law or
court order, provided that, to the extent practicable,  prior to such disclosure
required by law or court order Parent,  Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary will
give Seller  prior  written  notice of the nature of the law or order  requiring
disclosure and the disclosure to be made in accordance therewith.

                               -------------------------------------------------

                           (a) Prior to the Closing,  upon the terms and subject
to the  conditions  of this  Agreement,  each of Purchaser  and Seller shall use
commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done and  cooperate  with each  other in order to do,  all
things  necessary,  proper or  advisable  (subject  to any  Applicable  Laws) to
consummate  the Closing and the other  Transactions  as promptly as  practicable
including,  but not  limited  to (i) the  preparation  and  filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Closing and the
other Transactions and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite  approvals,  authorizations,   consents,  orders,  licenses,  permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental Entity,
and (ii) the  preparation  of any  documents  requested by Purchaser in order to
facilitate  financing of any of the Transactions.  In addition,  no party hereto

                                       70
<PAGE>

shall take any action after the date hereof that could reasonably be expected to
materially  delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,  any permission,
approval or consent from any Governmental  Entity or other Person required to be
obtained prior to Closing.

                           (b) Prior to the Closing,  each party shall  promptly
consult with the other  parties  hereto with respect to,  provide any  necessary
information  with respect to, and provide the other parties (or their respective
counsel)  with copies of, all filings  made by such party with any  Governmental
Entity or any other information  supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.  Each party hereto shall
promptly  provide the other  parties  with  copies of any written  communication
received  by such  party  from  any  Governmental  Entity  regarding  any of the
Transactions.  If any party hereto or Affiliate  thereof  receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity
with respect to any of the Transactions,  then such party shall endeavor in good
faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably  practicable and after
consultation with the other parties, an appropriate  response in compliance with
such  request.  To the extent that  transfers,  amendments or  modifications  of
permits  (including  environmental  permits)  are  required  as a result  of the
execution of this Agreement or consummation of any of the  Transactions,  Seller
shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to effect such transfers,  amendments
or modifications.

                           (c) Seller shall use commercially  reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the Closing, (i) if required,  the unconditional  consent to
the  Closing  and the other  Transactions  of each  lender to whom Seller or any
Business Subsidiary,  excluding any Seller's Foreign Subsidiary,  owes in excess
of $20,000 as of the Closing Date, (ii) the unconditional release of each Person
holding a mortgage or lien that is not an Assumed  Liability on real property or
material  personal  property owned or leased by Seller for the use or benefit of
the  Business  or  any  Business  Subsidiary,  excluding  any  Seller's  Foreign
Subsidiary;  (iii)  the  unconditional  consent  to the  Closing  and the  other
Transactions  of each lessor under each Lease relating to Real Property and each
other  material  lease;  (iv) with the  commercially  reasonable  assistance  of
Purchaser,  the transfer to Parent,  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary of all
Permits  required by the Business and the Business  Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of  business  or where such  transfer  is not  possible,  Seller will use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to assist  Parent,  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's
Subsidiary   in  obtaining  new  Permits  for  the  Business  and  the  Business
Subsidiaries  and (v) the  unconditional  consent to the  Closing  and the other

                                       71
<PAGE>

Transactions  of each other party to each Material  Contract with Seller for the
use or benefit of the Business or with any Business Subsidiary,  but only if and
to the extent the failure to obtain such consent would have an adverse effect on
the Business or any Business  Subsidiary or the ability of Seller,  Purchaser or
Purchaser's  Subsidiary to consummate  the  Transactions.  All such releases and
consents  shall  be in  writing  and  executed  counterparts  thereof  shall  be
delivered to Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary at or prior to the Closing.

                           (d)  In  addition  to  and   without   limiting   the
agreements of the parties  contained  above,  Seller,  Purchaser and Purchaser's
Subsidiary shall:

                                   (i) take  promptly  all actions  necessary to
         make the filings  required of them or any of their Affiliates under the
         HSR Act;

                                   (ii) comply at the earliest  practicable date
         with any request for additional  information  or  documentary  material
         received by Seller, Purchaser's Subsidiary or Purchaser or any of their
         Affiliates  from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act or from any
         State Attorney General or other Governmental  Entity in connection with
         antitrust matters;

                                   (iii) cooperate with each other in connection
         with any filing under the HSR Act and in connection  with resolving any
         investigation or other inquiry concerning the Transactions commenced by
         the FTC,  DOJ,  any State  Attorney  General or any other  Governmental
         Entity;

                                   (iv) use all reasonable commercial efforts to
         resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
         Transactions under any antitrust law; and

                                   (v) advise the other parties  promptly of any
         material  communication  received by such party from the FTC,  DOJ, any
         State Attorney General or any other  Governmental  Entity regarding any
         of  the  Transactions,  and  of  any  understandings,  undertakings  or
         agreements  (oral or written) such party proposes to make or enter into

                                       72
<PAGE>

         with the FTC, DOJ, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental
         Entity in connection with the Transactions.

Concurrently  with the  filing  of  notifications  under  the HSR Act or as soon
thereafter  as  practicable,  Seller  and  Purchaser  shall each  request  early
termination of the HSR Act waiting period.

                                   (e)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  any
         other covenant herein contained,  in connection with the receipt of any
         necessary  approvals under the HSR Act, neither Seller nor any Business
         Subsidiary shall be entitled without  Purchaser's prior written consent
         or required to divest or hold  separate or otherwise  take or commit to
         take any action that limits Purchaser's  freedom of action with respect
         of, or its ability to retain,  the  Business or the Assets any material
         portions thereof or any of the businesses, product lines, properties or
         assets of the Business.

                           (f)   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  any  other
covenant herein contained,  nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Seller,  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary (i) to divest or hold separate any
assets (including the Assets) or agree to limit its future activities, method or
place of doing business,  (ii) to commence any litigation  against any entity in
order to facilitate the consummation of any of the  Transactions,  (iii) to take
or  agree to take any  other  action  or  agree  to any  limitation  that  could
reasonably  be  expected  to have a  Material  Adverse  Effect on the  business,
assets,  condition (financial or otherwise),  results of operations or prospects
of either Seller,  Parent,  Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary on the one hand,
or the  Business,  on the other hand or (iv) to defend  against  any  litigation
brought by any  Governmental  Entity seeking to prevent the  consummation of, or
impose limitations on, any of the Transactions.

                 Section 6.4        Notification of Certain Matters.
                                    -------------------------------

                           (a)  Seller  shall  give  notice  to  Purchaser   and
Purchaser's  Subsidiary  promptly  after becoming aware of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or  non-occurrence  would be likely
to cause either (A) any  representation or warranty  contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or  inaccurate  in any  material  respect at any time from the date
hereof to the Closing Date or (B) any  condition  set forth in Article VII to be
unsatisfied  in any  material  respect  at any time from the date  hereof to the
Closing Date and (ii) any failure of Seller or any officer,  director,  employee
or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;  provided,  however,  that the

                                       73
<PAGE>

failure to give such notice  shall not be  required  from and after the time the
party to whom such notice is to be given has actual knowledge of the information
required to be included in such notice.

                           (b) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser and Purchaser's
Subsidiary  copies of (i) all audit reports,  letter rulings,  technical  advice
memoranda and similar documents issued by a Governmental  Entity relating to the
United States federal, state, local or foreign Taxes due from or with respect to
any Business  Subsidiary and (ii) any closing  agreements  entered into by or on
behalf of Seller  relating to the Business or any Business  Subsidiary  with any
taxing  authority,  which  come into the  possession  of  Seller  after the date
hereof.

                  Section 6.5 No Solicitation of Competing Transaction. (a) From
the date of this Agreement until the Closing or, if earlier,  the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms,  Seller shall not (whether directly
or indirectly  through  advisors,  agents or other  intermediaries),  and Seller
shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective officers, directors,  advisors,
representatives  and other agents not to,  directly or indirectly,  (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly  encourage,  or take any other action to  facilitate,  any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that  constitutes,  or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition  Proposal or (ii)  participate or engage in
substantive  discussions  or  negotiations  with,  or  disclose  or provide  any
non-public  information  relating to Seller or its subsidiaries or afford access
to the properties, books or records of Seller or its Subsidiaries to, any person
(including any "person" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) that
has made an Acquisition Proposal or with or to any Person in contemplation of an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if
and  only if (A) a person  has  submitted  an  unsolicited  written  Acquisition
Proposal (under  circumstances in which Seller has complied with its obligations
under this Section 6.5(a)) to Seller's Board of Directors, (B) Seller's Board of
Directors  believes in good faith,  based on such matters as it deems  relevant,
including  the  advice of  Seller's  financial  advisor,  that such  Acquisition



                                       74
<PAGE>

Proposal is a Superior  Proposal and (C) Seller's Board of Directors  determines
in  good  faith,  based  on  such  matters  as  it  deems  relevant,   including
consultation  with  Seller's  outside  legal  counsel,  that  engaging  in  such
negotiations or discussions or providing such information is required to satisfy
the  fiduciary  duties of the Board of Directors of Seller under Utah law,  then
Seller may furnish  information  to such  person with  respect to Seller and the
Business   Subsidiaries  (so  long  as  Seller  has  entered  into  a  customary
confidentiality  agreement with such party) and participate in negotiations  and
discussions  with such person  regarding  such  Acquisition  Proposal;  provided
further that, after the fifth business day following Parent's receipt of written
notice  advising  Parent that Seller's  Board of Directors is prepared to accept
such Superior Proposal, which notice specifies the material terms and conditions
of such  Superior  Proposal  and  identifies  the person  making  such  Superior
Proposal,  the Board of  Directors  of Seller  may,  in  response  to a Superior
Proposal  which was not solicited by Seller and which did not  otherwise  result
from a breach of this Section 6.5(a),  terminate this Agreement, if the Board of
Directors of Seller determines in good faith,  based on such matters as it deems
relevant,  including  consultation with the Seller's outside legal counsel, that
it is a Superior  Proposal under  Applicable  Law, and,  concurrently  with such
termination,  causes  Seller to pay the fee payable  pursuant to Section  8.2(b)
hereof by reason  thereof.  Nothing  contained in this Agreement  shall prohibit
Seller or Seller's  Board of Directors  from taking and  disclosing  to Seller's
stockholders  a position  with respect to a tender or exchange  offer by a third
party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e- 2(a)  promulgated  under the Exchange Act
or from  making any  disclosure  required by  applicable  law or, in the case of
Seller's   Board  of  Directors,   making  any  other   disclosure  to  Seller's
stockholders  that  Seller's  Board of  Directors  determines  in good  faith is
required  to be made to  satisfy  the  fiduciary  duties  of  Seller's  Board of
Directors under Applicable Law. Seller shall  immediately  cease and cause to be
terminated  and shall cause its  Affiliates  and  Subsidiaries  and its or their
respective  officers,  directors,  employees,   representatives  or  agents,  to
terminate all existing  discussions  or  negotiations,  if any, with any persons
conducted  heretofore  with respect to, or that could  reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

                           (b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5,  neither
the Board of Directors of Seller nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify,  or  propose  to  withdraw  or  modify,  in a manner  adverse to Parent,
Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary the approval or recommendation by the Board
of Directors of Seller of this Agreement,  (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
to  approve or  recommend,  any  Acquisition  Proposal  or (iii)  enter into any
agreement  with  respect  to  any  Acquisition  Proposal.   Notwithstanding  the
foregoing or anything else herein,  subject to compliance with the provisions of
this Section 6.5, prior to the Closing, Seller's Board of Directors may withdraw
or modify its approval or recommendation of the Agreement,  approve or recommend
a Superior  Proposal,  or enter  into an  agreement  with  respect to a Superior
Proposal,  in each  case at any time  after  the fifth  business  day  following
Parent's receipt of written notice (including by facsimile) from Seller advising
Parent that the Board of Directors  of Seller has  received a Superior  Proposal

                                       75
<PAGE>

which it intends to accept, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal,  but
only if Seller shall have caused its financial  and legal  advisors to negotiate
with  Parent  to make such  adjustments  to the  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement as would enable Seller to proceed with the Transactions.

                           (c) In  addition to the other  obligations  of Seller
set forth in this Section 6.5, Seller shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing of any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
or any inquiry  with  respect to or which is  reasonably  likely to result in an
Acquisition  Proposal,  the  material  terms  and  conditions  of such  request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person making the same.
Seller  shall  inform  Parent on a prompt basis of the status and content of any
discussions  regarding  any  Acquisition  Proposal  with a  third  party  and as
promptly as  practicable  of any change in the price,  structure  or form of the
consideration  or material  terms of and  conditions  regarding the  Acquisition
Proposal.

                           (d) Nothing in this  Section 6.5, and no action taken
by the Board of  Directors  of Seller  pursuant to this  Section  6.5,  will (i)
permit  Seller  to  enter  into  any  agreement  providing  for any  transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal for as long as this Agreement remains in
effect or (ii) affect in any manner any other  obligation  of Seller  under this
Agreement.

                  Section  6.6 Hiring by  Purchaser.  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's
Subsid  iary will offer  employment  to all of the  employees  of the  Business,
subject to the  satisfaction  by the  employees  of  conditions  in the ordinary
course of business. If Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary's failure to hire any
employees of Seller shall result in any WARN Act liability to Seller,  Purchaser
shall  indemnify and hold harmless  Seller  against such  liabilities  resulting
therefrom.  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  shall be free in their  sole
discretion to hire persons previously employed by the Business or not previously
employed by the Business.

                  Section 6.7 Release of Purchaser  from  Retained  Liabilities.
Pur chaser and Purchaser's  Subsidiary  shall not assume any Retained  Liability
and  Seller   shall  pay,   satisfy  and  perform  all   Retained   Liabilities.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of Seller
pursuant  to this  Section 6.7 shall  survive  the Closing and the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Moreover, except (i) to the extent reflected on



                                       76
<PAGE>

the June 30, 2000 Balance Sheet,  (ii) for the Canadian Union Contract and (iii)
as otherwise agreed to pursuant to this Agreement, neither Parent, Purchaser nor
Purchaser's  Subsidiary  shall assume any labor  agreements  or any  liabilities
thereunder or the fringe benefit plans or any other liabilities which Seller may
have with  respect  to any union or the  employees  of the  Business  (including
former  employees)  either  on the  date  hereof  or the  date  of the  Closing,
including  liabilities  of Seller  with  respect to payment of wages or pensions
which  may  have  accrued,  vested  or been  earned  prior  to the  Closing  and
liabilities  of Seller to  contribute  to pension or other fringe  benefit plans
with respect to or on account of service prior to the Closing,  and/or any other
term or condition of employ ment presently enjoyed by employees of the Business.


                  Section 6.8  Insurance;  Risk of Loss.  Seller shall  maintain
insurance  coverage and related risk of loss for one year  following the Closing
with respect to the Business and the Assets for events occurring,  circumstances
existing and Liabilities accruing before the Closing.

                  Section 6.9 Seller's  Non-Compete.(a) Except for Seller's (and
certain of Seller's employees)  continuation of the Ghana Activities  consistent
in magnitude and scope with its current  operations  there,  without the express
prior written consent of Purchaser,  neither Seller nor any Subsidiary of Seller
shall,  at any time  during the  seven-year  period  immediately  following  the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control or participate in the
ownership,  management  or control of, or be related or otherwise  affiliated in
any manner with,  any business that  competes  with the Business;  and provided,
further,  that the foregoing  shall not prohibit Seller from owning as a passive
investment 5% or less of the outstanding  equity of any publicly- traded entity.
Seller  agrees that Seller and Seller's  Subsidiaries  will not, for a period of
two years  after the  Closing  Date,  seek to employ any person now  employed by
Seller for the primary  benefit of the Business if such Person is then  employed
by Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser.

                           (b)  The  provisions  of the  covenant  contained  in
Section  6.9(a)  above shall be deemed to be a separate  covenant in each of the
states,  cities,  counties, or other political subdivisions of the United States
and in  foreign  countries.  The  parties  acknowledge  and agree that the time,
scope, and other provisions of Section 6.9(a) have been specifically  negotiated
by  sophisticated,  commercial  parties and specifi cally hereby agree that such
time,  scope and other provisions are reasonable  under the  circumstances.  The
parties further agree that if, at any time, despite the express agreement of the
parties,  a court of  competent  jurisdiction  holds that any portion of Section
6.9(a) is  unenforceable  because any of the  restrictions  therein are unreason
able,  or for any other reason,  such decision  shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement, and the maximum

                                       77
<PAGE>

estrictions of time or scope reasonable under the  circumstances,  as determined
by such court,  will be  substituted  for any such  restrictions  which are held
unenforceable.  In the event,  of a breach by any party of any of the provisions
of  Section  6.9(a),  the  parties   acknowledge  that  such  breach  may  cause
irreparable damage to Purchaser and Purchaser's Subsidiary,  the exact amount of
which may be difficult to ascertain, and the remedies at law for any such breach
may be  inadequate.  Accordingly,  Purchaser and  Purchaser's  Subsidiary may be
entitled,  in addition to any other rights or remedies  existing in their favor,
to seek  specific  performance  and  injunctive  relief in order to  enforce  or
prevent breach of any such provisions.

                 Section 6.10       Subsequent Actions.
                                   ------------------

                           (a) If at any time  after the  Closing  Purchaser  or
Purchaser's  Subsidiary  will  consider or be advised  that any deeds,  bills of
sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are  necessary  or desirable to vest,  perfect or confirm  ownership  (of
record or otherwise) in Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary, its right, title or
interest in, to or under any or all of the Assets or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement,   Seller  shall  execute  and  deliver  all  deeds,  bills  of  sale,
instruments of conveyance,  powers of attorney,  assignments  and assurances and
take and do all such other actions and things as may be reasonably  requested by
Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary in order to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

                           (b) After the Closing, each of Purchaser, Purchaser's
Subsidiary, any Seller's Purchased Subsidiary and Seller shall:

                                   (i)  cooperate  fully  in  preparing  any Tax
         Returns of the  Seller  and the  Seller's  Purchased  Subsidiaries  and
         preparing  for any audits of, or  disputes  or  litigation  with taxing
         authorities  regarding,  any Tax Returns  with  respect to any Seller's
         Purchased Subsidiary;

                                       78
<PAGE>

                                   (ii) make  available to the others and to any
         taxing authority as reasonably  requested all information and documents
         relating to Taxes of the Seller or the Seller's Purchased  Subsidiaries
         or any Taxes  imposed on the Business or Assets for which the party may
         have liability;

                                   (iii) provide  timely notice to the others in
         writing  of any  pending  or  threatened  tax  audits,  assessments  or
         litigation  with respect to Seller for any taxable period for which the
         other party may have liability under this Agreement; and

                                   (iv)  furnish  the others  with copies of all
         correspondence  received from any taxing  authority in connection  with
         any tax audit or information request with respect to any taxable period
         for which the other may have liability under this Agreement.

                           (c) In case at any time  after the  Closing  Date any
further  action is  necessary,  proper or advisable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable, each party hereto shall take,
or cause its proper officers or directors to take, all such necessary, proper or
advisable actions.

                  Section 6.11 Publicity. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release  acceptable to
Purchaser,  Purchaser's Subsidiary and Seller. Thereafter, until the Closing, or
the date the Transactions are terminated or abandoned  pursuant to Article VIII,
neither Seller, Purchaser,  Purchaser's Subsidiary,  nor any of their respective
Affiliates  shall issue or cause the  publication  of any press release or other
public  announcement  with respect to this  Agreement or the other  Transactions
without prior  consultation  with the other party,  except as may be required by
law or by any listing agreement with a national  securities  exchange or trading
market.

                  Section  6.12  Waiver of Bulk Sales  Requirement.  Each of the
parties waives compliance with any applicable bulk sales laws, including without
limitation the Uniform Commercial Code Bulk Transfer  provisions.  Seller agrees
to pay and  discharge  in due  course  and  will  indemnify  and  save  harmless
Purchaser  and  Purchaser's  Subsidiary,  from and  against  all claims  made by
creditors  of  Seller,  including  expenses  and  attorneys'  fees  incurred  by
Purchaser and Purchaser's  Subsidiary in defending  against such claims,  except
those expressly assumed by Purchaser and Purchaser's Subsidiary pursuant hereto.

                 Section 6.13       Completion of Non-assignable Contracts.
                                    --------------------------------------

                           (a)  Seller  shall  use its  commercially  reasonable
efforts to obtain any consent,  approval or amendment  required to novate and/or
assign any contract or agreement  included in the Assets,  or any other Asset to
be assigned to Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary hereunder and Purchaser shall
use all commercially  reasonable  efforts to fulfill Seller's  obligations under
such  contracts.   Seller  shall  keep  Purchaser  and  Purchaser's   Subsidiary
reasonably  informed  from  time to  time of the  status  of the  foregoing  and
Purchaser and Purchaser's Subsidiary shall cooperate with Seller in this regard.
To the  extent  that the rights of Seller or any of its  Subsidiaries  under any
contract or  agreement  included  in the Assets,  or under any other Asset to be
assigned to Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary hereunder,  may not be assigned
without the consent of another  Person which has not been obtained  prior to the
Closing,  this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same if
an  attempted  assignment  would be  unlawful.  If any such consent has not been
obtained or if any attempted  assignment  would be  ineffective  or would impair
Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary's rights under the instrument in question so
that  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary  would not acquire the benefit of all
such rights, then Seller or a Subsidiary thereof, as applicable,  to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law and the instrument,  shall act as Purchaser's
agent (or  Purchaser's  Subsidiary's  Agent) in order to obtain for Purchaser or
Purchaser's  Subsidiary  the benefits  thereunder  and shall  cooperate,  to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law and the instrument, with Purchaser or
Purchaser's  Subsidiary in any other reasonable  arrangement designed to provide
such  benefits  to  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's   Subsidiary(including,   without
limitation, by entering into an equivalent arrangement).


                 Section 6.14       Tax Matters

                           (a) Computation of Tax  Liabilities.  For purposes of
determining  the Taxes  imposed  which  relate to a Straddle  Period and must be
allocated  between a Pre-Closing  Straddle  Period and a  Post-Closing  Straddle
Period,  the Taxes  attributable  to the  Pre-Closing  Straddle  Period shall be
determined as follows:

                                       80
<PAGE>

                                   (i) In the case of Taxes  that are either (A)
         based  upon  or  related  to  income  or  receipts  or (B)  imposed  in
         connection  with any sale or other  transfer or  assignment of property
         (real, personal,  tangible, or intangible),  such Taxes shall be deemed
         equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable  year ended on
         and included the Closing Date; and

                                   (ii) In the case of Taxes  not  described  in
         Section  6.14(a)(i),  that are imposed on a periodic basis and measured
         by the amount,  value or level of any item (such as  personal  property
         taxes and real  estate  taxes),  such  Taxes  shall be deemed to be the
         amount of such Taxes for the  entire  period  (or,  in the case of such
         Taxes  determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
         immediately preced ing period) multiplied by a fraction,  the numerator
         of which is the number of calendar days in the taxable period ending on
         (and  including) the Closing Date, and the  denominator of which is the
         number of calendar days in the entire taxable period.

                                   (iii) If, for a particular Tax Return, Seller
         does not agree  with  Parent's  determination  of the  amount for which
         Seller  is  responsible   pursuant  to  Section  9.1(b)(i)   ("Parent's
         Requested   Amount"),   the  parties   shall  attempt  to  resolve  the
         disagreement.  If the parties  are unable to resolve  the  disagreement
         within 30 days  before  the  filing of the  relevant  Tax  Return,  the
         dispute shall be referred to a "Big Five"  accounting  firm  reasonably
         acceptable to both Seller and Purchaser  (the "Tax  Arbitrator")  whose
         determination shall be binding upon the parties.  The fees and expenses
         of the Tax  Arbitrator  shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.
         If the Tax Arbitrator has not rendered a decision at least two (2) days
         prior to the Due Date for  filing  the  relevant  Tax  Return,  the Tax
         Return shall be filed in the manner  determined by Purchaser and Seller
         shall pay any amounts  determined by Purchaser to be due and owing from
         the Seller at least one (1) day before the Due Date of such Tax Return.
         At such time as the  amount  due from  Seller to  Purchaser  is finally
         determined by the Tax  Arbitrator,  a payment shall be made from Seller
         to  Purchaser  in an amount  equal to the  excess,  if any,  of (i) the
         amount  finally  determined to be due over (ii) the Parent's  Requested
         Amount or from Purchaser to Seller in an amount equal to the excess, if
         any, of (i)  Parent's  Requested  Amount  over (ii) the amount  finally
         determined to be due.

                           (b) Tax Returns.  Seller shall  prepare,  in a manner
consistent  with past practice other than as required by law, all Tax Returns of
any Seller's Purchased Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period.  Seller shall file
or cause  to be filed  when due  such  Tax  Returns  described  in this  Section
6.14(b)(i);

                                   (i)  Parent  shall   prepare  all  other  Tax
         Returns with respect to any Seller's  Purchased  Subsidiary for taxable
         periods due to be filed after the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax
         Return for a Straddle  Period,  Parent shall deliver a copy of such Tax
         Return not less than sixty (60) days prior to the Due Date with respect
         to such Tax Return to Seller for its review and approval, which may not
         be  unreasonably  withheld.  Seller  shall be entitled to object to any
         items  reflected on such Tax Return  relating solely to Taxes for which
         Seller is liable pursuant to this  Agreement.  If Seller objects (which
         objection shall be made no later than 30 days before the Due Date), the
         parties shall attempt to resolve the  disagreement.  If the parties are
         unable to resolve the disagreement at least three (3) days prior to the
         Due Date, the same dispute  resolution and payment procedures set forth
         in Section 6.14(a)(iii) shall apply to this Section 6.14(b)(i).

                                   (ii)  Information  to be  Provided by Seller.
         Seller shall prepare and provide to Parent a package of tax information
         materials  (the "Tax  Package") with respect to any and all Tax Returns
         required to be filed by Parent pursuant to Section  6.14(b)(ii) for any
         Seller's  Purchased  Subsidiary  which  Tax  Return is  related  to any
         Straddle Period. Such Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with
         Seller's  past  practice  including  past  practice as to providing the
         information,  schedules  and  work  papers  and  as to  the  method  of
         computation of separate taxable income, tax credits, and other relevant
         measures of income and credits of Seller's Purchased Subsidiary. Seller
         shall  deliver to Parent the Tax Package for any Tax Return  related to
         any Straddle Period within ninety 90 days after the end of such period.

                           (c)  Assistance  and  Cooperation.  Seller and Parent
agree that, after the Closing Time:



                                       82
<PAGE>

                                   (i) each party  shall  assist  (and cause its
         Affiliates  to assist) the other in preparing any Tax Returns which the
         other is responsible for preparing and filing;

                                   (ii) the  parties  shall  cooperate  fully in
         preparing  for any  audits  of, or  disputes  with  taxing  authorities
         regarding, any Tax Returns and payments in respect thereof;

                                   (iii) the  parties  shall make  available  to
         each other and to any taxing  authority  as  reasonably  requested  all
         relevant books and records relating to Taxes;

                                   (iv) the parties shall provide  timely notice
         to  the  other  in  writing  of  any  pending  or  proposed  audits  or
         assessments  with  respect  to Taxes  for  which  the other may have an
         indemnification obligation under this Agreement;

                                   (v) the parties shall furnish each other with
         copies of all relevant  correspondence  received from any Tax authority
         in connection with any audit or information request with respect to any
         Taxes referred to in subsection (D) above; and

                                   (vi) except as otherwise provided herein, the
         party  requesting  assistance  or  cooperation  shall bear the  other's
         out-of-  pocket  expenses in complying  with such request to the extent
         that  those  expenses  are  attributable  to fees  and  other  costs of
         unaffiliated third-party service providers other than attorneys' fees.

                           (d)  Maintenance  of Books and Records.  Seller shall
transfer  to Parent  all books and  records in  existence  on the  Closing  Date
related to any Seller's  Purchased  Subsidiary.  Until the applicable statute of
limitations  (including  periods of waiver) has run for any Tax Returns filed or
required to be filed  covering the periods up to and including the Closing Date,
Parent  shall,  or cause its  Affiliates  to,  retain  all books and  records in
existence on the Closing Date related to any Seller's  Purchased  Subsidiary and
after the Closing Date will provide  Seller access to such books and records for
inspection and copying by Seller and its representatives  during normal business

                                       83
<PAGE>

hours upon reasonable request and upon reasonable  notice.  After the expiration
of such  period,  no such books and records  shall be destroyed by Parent or its
Affiliates  without first advising  Seller in writing  detailing the contents of
any such  books  and  records  and  giving  Seller  at least  120 days to obtain
possession thereof.

                           (e)   Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments.
                                 ----------------------------------------

                                   (i) Refunds and  Overpayments.  If, after the
         Closing,  Parent or its  Affiliates  (a)  receive  any  refund,  or (b)
         applies any overpayment of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Period
         (except  to the  extent  reflected  in the  Financial  Statements  as a
         current  asset) which,  in either case (a) and (b), (i) relate to a Tax
         paid  by  any   Business   Subsidiary   or  (ii)  is  the   subject  of
         indemnification  by Seller,  Parent shall  promptly pay, or cause to be
         paid,  to  Seller  an  amount  in  aggregate  equal  to the  refund  or
         overpayment  (including  interest) received or applied by Parent or its
         Affiliates.  Parent agrees to notify Seller  promptly of the receipt of
         any such refund or application of any such overpayment;

                                   (ii) Subsequent Adjustment. In the event that
         any Tax  refund,  benefit  or savings  described  in any clause of this
         Section 6.14(e) is  subsequently  reduced as a result of any adjustment
         required by any Tax authority,  this Section  6.14(e) shall be applied,
         taking into account such  adjustment.  If Seller,  on the one hand,  or
         Parent or its  Affiliates,  on the other hand,  have paid any amount to
         the other on the basis of the application of this Section 6.14(e) prior
         to such  subsequent  adjustment  or  such  subsequent  creation  of tax
         attributes  (each,  a subsequent  event) and the amount due pursuant to
         this  Section  6.14(e)  taking into account  such  subsequent  event is
         determined to have changed as a result of such  subsequent  event,  the
         parties  agree to make any payment  necessary to settle the  difference
         between  the  amount  previously  paid  and  the  amount   subsequently
         determined to be due.

                  Section 6.15 General Cooperation. From the date hereof through

                                   (iii)  Except  as  provided  in this  Section

any  taxable  period  beginning  after the  Closing  Date and (ii) any  Straddle

Subsidiary on one hand and Seller on the other hand shall give each other prompt
notice  of any  third-party  claim  that  may give  rise to any  indemnification
obligation  under this Article IX,  together with the  estimated  amount of such
claim,  and  Seller  shall  have the right to assume the  defense  (at  Seller's
expense)  of any such  claim  through  counsel  of Seller'  own  choosing  by so
notifying  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  within  30 days of the  first
receipt by Seller of such notice from  Purchaser;  provided,  however,  that any
such counsel  shall be  reasonably  satisfactory  to  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's
Subsidiary.  Failure to give such notice shall not affect the  indemnifica  tion
obligations hereunder in the absence of actual and material prejudice. If, under
applicable  standards of  professional  conduct,  a conflict with respect to any
significant issue between any Purchaser  Indemnified Person and Seller exists in

                                      100
<PAGE>

respect of such  third-party  claim,  Seller shall pay the  reasonable  fees and
expenses of such  additional  counsel as may be required to be retained in order
to eliminate such conflict.  Seller shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel  employed by Purchaser or Pur chaser's  Subsidiary for any period during
which  Seller has not assumed the defense of any such  third-party  claim (other
than during any period in which  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary  will have
failed to give notice of the  third-party  claim as provided  above).  If Seller
assumes such defense,  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Subsidiary shall have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel  employed by Seller,  it being  understood that Seller
shall  control such defense.  If Seller  chooses to defend or prosecute a third-
party claim,  Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary shall cooperate in the defense
or  prosecution  thereof,   which  cooperation  shall  include,  to  the  extent
reasonably  requested by Seller, the retention,  and the provision to Seller, of
records and informa tion  reasonably  relevant to such  third-party  claim,  and
making  employees of the Business  available on a mutually  convenient  basis to
provide  additional  information  and  explanation  of  any  materials  provided
hereunder.  If Seller  chooses to defend or  prosecute  any  third-party  claim,
Purchaser  shall  agree  to any  settlement,  compromise  or  discharge  of such
third-party  claim that Seller may recommend and that, by its terms,  discharges
Purchaser,  Purchaser's  Subsidiary  and any of their  Affiliates  from the full
amount of  liability  in  connection  with  such  third-party  claim;  provided,
however,  that, Seller shall not consent to, and Purchaser shall not be required
to agree to, the entry of any  judgment  or enter into any  settlement  that (i)
provides  for injunc  tive or other  non-monetary  relief  affecting  Purchaser,
Purchaser's Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates or (ii) does not include as an
unconditional  term  thereof  the giving of a release  from all  liability  with
respect  to  such  claim  by  each  claimant  or  plaintiff  to  each  Purchaser
Indemnified Person that is the subject of such third-party claim.

                 Section 9.3       Procedures Related to Tax Contests.
                                   ----------------------------------

promptly  notify  the other in  writing  upon  receipt by either or any of their
Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened Tax Audit which may materially
affect the  liability  for Taxes for which Seller would be required to indemnify
Parent, any of its Affiliates or any Seller's Purchased  Subsidiary  pursuant to
Section  9.1(b)(i) or for which  Parent  would be required to  indemnify  Seller
pursuant to Section 9.1(d).

                           (b) If such Tax Audit involves solely Taxes for which
Seller is liable  (taking  into  consideration  any  indemnification  obligation
pursuant to this  Agreement),  Seller shall at its expense  control the complete
defense and  settlement  of the interests of itself and each other party in such
Tax Audit,  provided that Seller  notifies  Parent in writing within thirty (30)

                                      101

days of receiving  notice from Parent under  Section  9.3(a).  Seller shall keep
Parent  informed  about,  and shall allow Parent to participate  in, at its sole
expense,  the defense of any such Tax Audit.  Seller  shall not pay,  discharge,
settle, compromise, litigate, or otherwise dispose (collectively,  "dispose") of
any item subject to such Tax Audit without  obtaining the prior written  consent
of Parent,  which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed;  such
consent  shall be deemed  not to be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed  if the
disposition  of any item would result in an increase in the  liability for Taxes
of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent.

                           (c) If Seller does not provide  Parent with notice as
required under this Section 9.3(b),  Parent shall control the defense of any Tax
Audit involving solely Taxes for which Seller is liable (taking into account any
indemnification  obligation  imposed  pursuant to this  Agreement)  and shall be
entitled  to  dispose  of such item  subject to Tax Audit  without  the  written
consent of Seller.  If,  prior to Parent  reaching  a proposed  settlement  with
respect to such Tax Audit, Seller notifies Parent that it desires to participate
in such Tax Audit,  Seller shall be entitled to do so provided that Seller doing
so would not prejudice  Parent with respect to the Tax authorities  dealing with
such audit and Seller shall pay to Parent,  prior to Seller assuming  control of
such Tax Audit,  Parent's costs and expenses  (including  attorneys' fees, other
out-of-pocket  costs and any allocable  costs) incurred to date in handling such
Tax Audit.  Thereafter,  the  provisions of Section  9.3(b) shall govern the han
dling of such Tax Audit.

                           (d) If a Tax Audit  involves  Taxes  for  which  both
Seller and  Parent  may be  liable,  Parent  shall at its  expense  control  the
complete  defense and settlement of the interests of itself and each other party
in such Tax Audit; provided, however, that (i) Parent shall keep Seller informed
about,  and shall consult with Seller in good faith about, any items in such Tax
Audit with respect to Taxes for which Seller is liable and (ii) Parent shall not
be  entitled  to dispose of any item  subject to such Tax Audit with  respect to
Taxes for which Seller is liable without  obtaining the prior consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                           (e)  Parent,  in  its  sole  discretion  and  at  its
expense,  shall control the complete  defense and settlement of the interests of
itself and each other party in any other Tax Audit.

                  Section  9.4   Survival   of   Indemnification   Claims.   The
indemnification  obligations  set forth in this  Article  IX shall  survive  the
Closing.

                  Section  9.5  Tax  Effect  of  Indemnification  Payments.  All
indemnity  payments  made by  Seller to  Purchaser  Indemnified  Persons,  or by
Purchaser  Indemni fied Persons to Seller,  pursuant to this Agreement  shall be
treated  for all Tax  purposes as  adjustments  to the  consideration  paid with
respect to the Assets.

                  Section   9.6   Effect   of   Investigation.   The   right  to
indemnification,  payment of Purchaser Losses or for other remedies based on any
representation,  warranty, covenant or obligation of Seller contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation  conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time,  whether  before or after the execution and delivery of this  Agreement or
the date the Closing  occurs,  with respect to the accuracy or  inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation,  warranty, covenant or obligation. The
waiver of any condition to the obligation of Purchaser or Purchaser's Subsidiary
to consummate the Transactions, where such condition is based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty,  or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation,  shall not affect the right to indemnification,  payment
of Purchaser  Losses,  or other remedy based on such  representation,  warranty,
covenant or obligation.

                  Section  9.7  Survival  of  Covenants,   Representations   and
Warranties.  Except for the  representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.1,  Section 4.2,  Section  4.12,  Section 4.16,  Section  4.24,  Section 4.28,
Section 4.29, Section 4.32 and Section 6.14 each of which shall survive forever,
the  remaining  representations  and  warranties of Seller made herein or in any
other  documentation  delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the covenants and
agreements  to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date shall  survive until
April 30, 2002;  provided,  that (a) expiration of a  representation,  warranty,
covenant or agreement  shall not affect the  obligations of a party with respect
to  claims  for   indemnification  for  which  notice  has  been  given  to  the
indemnifying  party in accordance  with this Article IX prior to such expiration
and (b) all covenants,  agreements and indemnification  matters that contemplate
or may involve  actions to be taken or  obligations  in effect after the Closing
shall survive the Closing Date.

                  Section 9.8 Right of Offset.  The parties hereto agree that in
the event a claim for  indemnification by a Purchaser  Indemnified Person is not
paid  within  thirty  (30) days of  reaching  an  agreement  thereof  or a court

                                      103
<PAGE>

determination that Seller has an indemnifiable obligation,  Purchaser and Parent
shall have the uncondi  tional  right to offset,  on a dollar for dollar  basis,
against the  principal  payments  on the Nevada  Loan,  in the reverse  order of
maturity,  the amount of any such claim for indemnification  made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Person pursuant to Article IX hereof.

                  Section  10.1  Fees  and  Expenses.  All  costs  and  expenses
incurred  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  and  the  consummation  of  the
Transactions  shall be paid by the  party  incurring  such  expenses,  except as
specifically  provided to the contrary in this  Agreement and except as provided
in Section 8.2(b) and as follows:

                           (a)   Purchaser   shall  bear  the  fee   payable  in
connection with the Pre-Merger Notification filing required by the HSR Act; and

                           (b) All Transfer  Taxes arising out of, in connection
with or attributable  to the  transactions  effected  pursuant to this Agreement

obligation  to pay such  Transfer  Tax.  Notwithstanding  Section  6.14(b),  the
Transfer  Tax payor  shall  prepare  and timely  file all  relevant  Tax Returns
required to be filed in respect of such Transfer Tax, pay the Transfer Tax shown
on such Tax Return,  and notify the other parties in writing of the Transfer Tax

making such  Transfer Tax payment  shall  provide the other party for its review
and  comment a copy of the  Transfer  Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to
the Due Date for filing such Tax Return.  The Parties  shall  attempt to resolve
any  disagreement  with respect to the contents of the Transfer Tax Return prior
to filing.  If any  disagreements  cannot be  resolved,  the Transfer Tax Return
shall be filed as prepared by the Transfer Tax Payor.

                  Section 10.2 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be
amended,  modified  and  supplemented  in any and all  respects,  but  only by a

                  Section 10.5 Entire Agreement;  No Third Party  Beneficiaries.
This  Agreement,  the  Disclosure  Schedule and other  schedules,  annexes,  and
exhibits  hereto and the  Confidentiality  Agreement (a)  constitute  the entire
agreement and supercede all prior  agreements and  understandings,  both written
and oral,  among the  parties  with  respect to the  subject  matter  hereof and
thereof  and   supersede   and  cancel  all  prior   agreements,   negotiations,
correspondence,  undertakings, understandings and communications of the parties,
oral and written,  with respect to the subject  matter  hereof,  and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and thereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.

                  Section  10.6  Severability.  Any  term or  provision  of this
Agreement that is held by a court of competent  jurisdiction  or other authority
to be invalid,  void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or  enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or  enforceability  of the offending term or provision in
any other  situation or in any other  jurisdiction.  If the final  judgment of a
court of competent  jurisdiction  or other  authority  declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid,  void or unenforceable,  the parties agree that the
court  making  such  determination  shall  have the power to reduce  the  scope,
duration,  area or  applicability  of the term or provision,  to delete specific
words or  phrases,  or to replace any  invalid,  void or  unenforceable  term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and  enforceable and that comes
closest to  expressing  the  intention of the invalid or  unenforceable  term or
provision.

                  Section 10.7 Governing  Law. This Agreement  shall be governed
by and  construed in accordance  with the laws of the State of Delaware  without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

                Section  10.8   Enforcement;   Venue.  The  parties  agree  that
irreparable  damage would occur in the event that any of the  provisions of this
Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific  terms or were
otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or  injunctions  to prevent  breaches of this  Agreement and to
enforce  specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
the United States  located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware  state court,
this being in addition to any other  remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the  personal  jurisdiction  of any  Federal  court  located  in the State of
Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement  or any of the  Transactions,  (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to

                                      107
<PAGE>

deny or defeat such personal  jurisdiction  by motion or other request for leave
from any such court and (c) agrees  that it shall not bring any action  relating
to this Agreement or any of the  Transactions  in any court other than a Federal
or state court sitting in the State of Delaware.

                  Section 10.9 Election of Remedies. Neither the exercise of nor
the  failure to  exercise a right of set-off or to give  notice of a claim under
this  Agreement  will  constitute an election of remedies or limit  Purchaser or
Purchaser's  Subsidiary or any of the Purchaser  Indemnified  Persons on the one
hand, or Seller or any of the Seller  Indemnified  Persons on the other hand, in
any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to any
of them, whether at law or in equity.

                  Section 10.10  Assignment.  Neither this  Agreement not any of
the rights,  interests or obligations  hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties  hereto  (whether by  operation of law or  otherwise)  without the prior
written  content of the other  parties,  except that  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's
Subsidiary may assign, in their sole discretion,  any or all of their rights and
interests hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.
Subject to the preceding  sentence,  this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the  benefit  of and be  enforceable  by the  parties  and  their  respective
successors and assigns.

                  Section 10.11 Headings.  The article,  section,  paragraph and
other  headings  contained in this  Agreement  are inserted for  convenience  of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or  interpretation of
this Agreement.
