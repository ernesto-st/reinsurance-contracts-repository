     Letter of Credit shall expire on the date on which it otherwise  would have

     later than 11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior
     to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting
     of Eurodollar Rate Advances,  or not later than  10:00 A.M.  (New York City
     time)  on the  Business  Day of the  proposed  Borrowing  in the  case of a
     Borrowing  consisting  of  Base  Rate  Advances,  by  the  Borrower  to the
     Administrative  Agent,  which shall give to each Appropriate  Lender prompt
     notice thereof by telex or  telecopier.  Each such notice of a Borrowing (a
     "Notice of  Borrowing")  shall be by telephone,  confirmed  immediately  in
     writing,  or telex or telecopier,  in  substantially  the form of Exhibit B
     hereto,  specifying  therein  the  requested  (i) date  of such  Borrowing,
     (ii) Facility  under  which such  Borrowing  is to be made,  (iii) Type  of
     Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iv) aggregate amount of such Borrowing
     and (v) in the case of a Borrowing  consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances,
     initial  Interest  Period for each such Advance.  Each  Appropriate  Lender
     shall, before 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of any Borrowing,
     make  available  for the account of its  Applicable  Lending  Office to the
     Administrative  Agent at the  Administrative  Agent's Account,  in same day
     funds,  such Lender's  ratable portion of such Borrowing in accordance with
     the respective Commitments under the applicable Facility of such Lender and
     the other Appropriate Lenders.  After the Administrative Agent's receipt of
     such funds and upon
<PAGE>

     fulfillment of the  applicable  conditions  set forth in  Article III,  the
     Administrative  Agent will make such funds  available  to the  Borrower  by
     crediting the Borrower's Account;  provided,  however, that, in the case of
     any Revolving Credit Borrowing,  the Administrative Agent shall first apply
     such funds to prepay  ratably the aggregate  principal  amount of any Swing
     Line  Advances  and  Letter of Credit  Advances  outstanding  at such time,
     together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon to and as of such date.

               (b) (i) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice,  given
          not  later  than  1:00 P.M.  (New York  City  time) on the date of the
          proposed Swing Line Borrowing,  by the Borrower to the Swing Line Bank
          and the  Administrative  Agent.  Each  such  notice  of a  Swing  Line
          Borrowing (a "Notice of Swing Line Borrowing")  shall be by telephone,
          confirmed  immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier,  specifying
          therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing,  (ii) amount of such
          Borrowing and  (iii) maturity  of such Borrowing (which maturity shall
          be no later than the tenth  Business Day after the  requested  date of
          such  Borrowing).  The Swing  Line  Bank  will make the  amount of the
          requested Swing Line Advances available to the Administrative Agent at
          the  Administrative  Agent's  Account,  in same day  funds.  After the
          Administrative  Agent's receipt of such funds and upon  fulfillment of
          the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative
          Agent will make such funds  available to the Borrower by crediting the
          Borrower's Account.

          (ii) The Swing  Line Bank  may,  at any time in its sole and  absolute
     discretion,  request on behalf of the  Borrower  (and the  Borrower  hereby
     irrevocably  authorizes  the Swing Line Bank to so  request on its  behalf)
     that each  Revolving  Credit  Lender make a Base Rate  Advance in an amount
     equal to such  Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Advances
     then outstanding.  Such request shall be deemed to be a Notice of Borrowing
     for purposes  hereof and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
     Sections  2.01(b) and 2.02(a)  without regard solely to the minimum amounts
     specified  therein but subject to the  satisfaction  of the  conditions set
     forth in Section 3.02.  The Swing Line Bank shall furnish the Borrower with
     a copy of the applicable Notice of Borrowing promptly after delivering such
     notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make
     an  amount  equal to its Pro Rata  Share of the  amount  specified  in such
     Notice of Borrowing  available  for the account of its  Applicable  Lending
     Office to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank,
     by deposit to the Administrative  Agent's Account,  in same date funds, not
     later than 11:00 A.M. on the day specified in such Notice of Borrowing.

          (iii) If for any reason any Swing Line Advance cannot be refinanced by
     a Revolving  Credit Borrowing as contemplated by Section  2.02(b)(ii),  the
     request for Base Rate Advances  submitted by the applicable Swing Line Bank
     as set forth in Section  2.02(b)(ii) shall be deemed to be a request by the
     Swing Line Bank that each of the  Revolving  Credit  Lenders  fund its risk
     participation  in the relevant Swing Line Advance and each Revolving Credit
     Lender's payment to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of the Swing
     Line Bank  pursuant  to  Section  2.02(b)(ii)  shall be deemed  payment  in
     respect of such participation.

          (iv) If and to the extent that any  Revolving  Credit Lender shall not
     have  made the  amount of its Pro Rata  Share of such  Swing  Line  Advance
     available to the
<PAGE>

     Administrative   Agent  in  accordance   with  the  provisions  of  Section
     2.02(b)(ii),   such   Revolving   Credit   Lender  agrees  to  pay  to  the
     Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest
     thereon,  for each day from the date of the applicable  Notice of Borrowing
     delivered  by the Swing Line Bank until the date such amount is paid to the
     Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

          (v) Each Revolving Credit Lender's obligation to make Revolving Credit
     Advances or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Advances
     pursuant to this Section  2.02(b) shall be absolute and  unconditional  and
     shall not be  affected  by any  circumstance,  including  (A) any  set-off,
     counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
     against  the Swing  Line Bank,  the  Borrower  or any other  Person for any
     reason whatsoever,  (B) the occurrence of continuance of a Default,  or (C)
     any other occurrence,  event or condition, whether or not similar to any of
     the  foregoing;  provided,  however,  that each Revolving  Credit  Lender's
     obligation  to make  Revolving  Credit  Advances  pursuant to this  Section
     2.02(b) is subject to  satisfaction  of the conditions set forth in Section
     3.02. No funding of risk  participations  shall relieve or otherwise impair
     the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Advances,  together with
     interest as provided herein.

          (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary  notwithstanding,
     (i) the Borrower may not select  Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing
     if the aggregate  amount of such Borrowing is less than $1,000,000  (unless
     such Borrowing corresponds to an amortization payment) or if the obligation
     of the  Appropriate  Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be
     suspended pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.10 and (ii) the Term B Advances may
     not be  outstanding as part of more than 10 separate  Interest  Periods and
     the Revolving  Credit  Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than
     15 separate Interest Periods.

          (d) Each Notice of Borrowing  and each Notice of Swing Line  Borrowing
     shall  be  irrevocable  and  binding  on the  Borrower.  In the case of any
     Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised
     of Eurodollar Rate Advances,  the Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate
     Lender  against  any loss,  cost or expense  incurred  by such  Lender as a
     result of any  failure to fulfill on or before the date  specified  in such
     Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable  conditions set forth
     in Article III,  including,  without limitation,  any loss, cost or expense
     incurred by reason of the  liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other
     funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender
     as part of such Borrowing  when such Advance,  as a result of such failure,
     is not made on such date.

          (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from an
     Appropriate  Lender  prior to the date of any  Borrowing  under a  Facility
     under  which such  Lender has a  Commitment  that such Lender will not make
     available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
     Borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent may assume that such Lender has made
     such  portion  available  to the  Administrative  Agent on the date of such
     Borrowing in accordance with  subsection (a)  of this  Section 2.02 and the
     Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,  make available
     to the Borrower on such date a corresponding  amount.  If and to the extent
     that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable  portion  available to
     the  Administrative  Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to
     repay  or  pay  to  the  Administrative  Agent  forthwith  on  demand  such
     corresponding amount and
<PAGE>

     to pay  interest  thereon,  for each day from the date such  amount is made
     available to the  Borrower  until the date such amount is repaid or paid to
     the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower,  the interest
     rate applicable at such time under Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such
     Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of such Lender,  the Federal Funds Rate. If
     such  Lender  shall  pay to the  Administrative  Agent  such  corresponding
     amount,  such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part
     of such Borrowing for all purposes.

          (f) The  failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as
     part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation,
     if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no
     Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
     Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters
     of Credit. (a) Request for Issuance.  Each Letter of Credit shall be issued
     upon notice,  given not later than  11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the
     third Business Day (or such fewer days as the Issuing Bank and the Borrower
     shall agree)  prior to the date of the proposed  issuance of such Letter of
     Credit,  by the  Borrower  to the  Issuing  Bank,  which  shall give to the
     Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender prompt notice thereof
     by telecopier or electronic communication.  Each such notice of issuance of
     a Letter  of  Credit  (a  "Notice  of  Issuance")  shall  be by  telephone,
     confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier  electronic  communication,
     specifying  therein the requested (A) date of such issuance (which shall be
     a  Business   Day),   (B) Available   Amount  of  such  Letter  of  Credit,
     (C) expiration  date of such Letter of Credit,  (D) name and address of the
     beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit,
     and shall be  accompanied by such  application  and agreement for letter of
     credit  as the  Issuing  Bank  may  specify  to  the  Borrower  for  use in
     connection  with such  requested  Letter of  Credit  (a  "Letter  of Credit
     Agreement").  If  (x) the  requested  form  of such  Letter  of  Credit  is
     acceptable  to the Issuing Bank in its sole  discretion  and (y) it has not
     received notice of objection to such issuance from Lenders holding at least
     51% of the  Revolving  Credit  Commitments,  the  Issuing  Bank will,  upon
     fulfillment of the applicable  conditions  set forth in  Article III,  make
     such Letter of Credit  available to the Borrower at its office  referred to
     in Section 9.02 or as otherwise agreed with the Borrower in connection with
     such  issuance.  In the event and to the extent that the  provisions of any
     Letter  of  Credit  Agreement  shall  conflict  with  this  Agreement,  the
     provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

          (b) Letter of Credit  Reports.  The Issuing Bank shall furnish  (A) to
     the  Administrative  Agent on the first Business Day of each week a written
     report  summarizing  issuance  and  expiration  dates of  Letters of Credit
     issued  during the previous  week and  drawings  during such week under all
     Letters  of  Credit,  (B) to  each  Revolving  Credit  Lender  on the first
     Business  Day of each  month a  written  report  summarizing  issuance  and
     expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued during the preceding month and
     drawings  during  such  month  under all  Letters  of Credit and (C) to the
     Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender on the first Business
     Day of each  calendar  quarter a written  report  setting forth the average
     daily aggregate  Available Amount during the preceding  calendar quarter of
     all Letters of Credit.

          (c) Participations in Letters of Credit. Upon the issuance of a Letter
     of Credit by the Issuing Bank under Section 2.03(a), the Issuing Bank shall
     be deemed, without further
<PAGE>

     action by any party hereto,  to have sold to each Revolving  Credit Lender,
     and each such  Revolving  Credit  Lender shall be deemed,  without  further
     action by any party  hereto,  to have  purchased  from the Issuing  Bank, a
     participation  in such  Letter of Credit  in an amount  for each  Revolving
     Credit Lender equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Available Amount
     of such  Letter of Credit,  effective  upon the  issuance of such Letter of
     Credit.  In  consideration  and  in  furtherance  of  the  foregoing,  each
     Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay
     such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each L/C  Disbursement  made by the Issuing
     Bank  and not  reimbursed  by the  Borrower  forthwith  on the  date due as
     provided  in Section  2.04(d) by making  available  for the  account of its
     Applicable  Lending Office to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of
     the Issuing Bank by deposit to the Administrative  Agent's Account, in same
     day  funds,  an amount  equal to such  Lender's  Pro Rata Share of such L/C
     Disbursement. Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
     obligation to acquire  participations  pursuant to this Section  2.03(c) in
     respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
     affected by any  circumstance  whatsoever,  including  the  occurrence  and
     continuance  of a Default or an Event of Default or the  termination of the
     Commitments,  and that each such payment shall be made without any set-off,
     abatement,  withholding or reduction whatsoever.  If and to the extent that
     any  Revolving  Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of such L/C
     Disbursement  available to the Administrative  Agent, such Revolving Credit
     Lender agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand such
     amount together with interest thereon,  for each day from the date such L/C
     Disbursement  is due pursuant to Section 2.04(d) until the date such amount
     is paid to the  Administrative  Agent,  at the  Federal  Funds Rate for its
     account or the account of the Issuing Bank, as  applicable.  If such Lender
     shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent such  amount for the account of the
     Issuing  Bank on any  Business  Day,  such  amount  so paid in  respect  of
     principal  shall  constitute a Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender
     on such Business Day for purposes of this  Agreement,  and the  outstanding
     principal  amount of the Letter of Credit  Advance made by the Issuing Bank
     shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

          (d) Drawing and  Reimbursement.  The payment by the Issuing  Bank of a
     draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of
     this  Agreement  the  making  by the  Issuing  Bank of a Letter  of  Credit
     Advance, which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft.

          (e)  Failure to Make  Letter of Credit  Advances.  The  failure of any
     Lender to make the  Letter of Credit  Advance  to be made by it on the date
     specified  in Section  2.03(c)  shall not relieve  any other  Lender of its
     obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but
     no Lender shall be responsible  for the failure of any other Lender to make
     the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

          SECTION 2.04. Repayment of Advances. (a) Term B Advances. The Borrower
     shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Term
     B Lenders the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term B Advances
     on the following  dates in the amounts  indicated  (which  amounts shall be
     reduced as a result of the  application of  prepayments in accordance  with
     the order of priority set forth in Section 2.06):

     provided,  however, that the final principal installment shall be repaid on
     the  Termination  Date in respect  of the Term B Facility  and in any event
     shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Term B
     Advances outstanding on such date.

          (b)  Revolving  Credit  Advances.  The  Borrower  shall  repay  to the
     Administrative  Agent  for the  ratable  account  of the  Revolving  Credit
     Lenders on the Termination Date in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility

     principal  amount of each  Swing Line  Advance  made by each of them on the

     circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances:
<PAGE>

               (A) any lack of validity or  enforceability of any Loan Document,

          agreement or instrument  relating thereto (all of the foregoing being,

               (B) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment of, or in
          any other term of, all or any of the  Obligations  of the  Borrower in

          of or any  consent  to  departure  from all or any of the L/C  Related
          Documents;

               (C) the existence of any claim,  set-off,  defense or other right
          that the Borrower may have at any time against any  beneficiary or any
          transferee  of a Letter of Credit (or any  Persons  for which any such
          beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or
          any  other  Person,   whether  in  connection  with  the  transactions

          any of the  Obligations  of the Borrower in respect of the L/C Related
          Documents; or

               (G) any other  circumstance or happening  whatsoever,  whether or
          not similar to any of the foregoing,  including,  without  limitation,
          any other  circumstance  that  might  otherwise  constitute  a defense
          available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower.

     (i) shall be in an aggregate  amount of $5,000,000 or an integral  multiple
     of  $1,000,000 in excess  thereof and  (ii) shall be made ratably among the

          (b) Mandatory.  (i) The Borrower  shall, on the 90th day following the

     the  Revolving  Credit  Advances,  (y) the  Letter of Credit  Advances  and
     (z) the Swing Line Advances then outstanding  plus the aggregate  Available
     Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding  exceeds (B) the Revolving
     Credit Facility on such Business Day.

          (iv)  The  Borrower   shall,   on  each   Business  Day,  pay  to  the

     Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility on
     such Business Day.
<PAGE>

          (v)  Prepayments  of the  Revolving  Credit  Facility made pursuant to
     clause  (iii)  above  shall be first  applied  to  prepay  Letter of Credit
     Advances  then  outstanding  until such  Advances are paid in full,  second
     applied to prepay Swing Line Advances then outstanding  until such Advances
     are paid in full and third applied to prepay Revolving Credit Advances then
     outstanding  comprising part of the same Borrowings until such Advances are
     paid in full and fourth  deposited  in the L/C  Collateral  Account to cash
     collateralize  100% of the  Available  Amount of the Letters of Credit then
     outstanding; and the amount remaining (if any) after the prepayment in full
     of the Advances then outstanding and the 100% cash collateralization of the
     aggregate  Available  Amount of Letters of Credit then  outstanding  may be
     retained  by the  Borrower.  Upon the  drawing  of any Letter of Credit for
     which funds are on deposit in the L/C Collateral Account,  such funds shall
     be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or Revolving  Credit  Lenders,  as
     applicable.

          (vi)  Anything  contained  in this  Section  2.06(b)  to the  contrary
     notwithstanding,  if,  following the occurrence of any "Asset  Disposition"
     (as such term is defined in the 2002 Senior  Notes  Indenture)  by any Loan
     Party or any of its Subsidiaries,  the Parent would be required to apply or
     cause  its  Subsidiaries  to  apply  an  amount  equal  to any of the  "Net
     Available Cash" (as defined in the 2002 Senior Notes Indenture)  thereof by
     a particular date (an "Application  Date") in a particular manner, in order
     to excuse the Borrower  from being  required to make an "Offer" (as defined
     in the  2002  Senior  Notes  Indenture)  in  connection  with  such  "Asset
     Disposition,"  and the  Borrower  shall  have  failed to so apply an amount
     equal to such "Net  Available  Cash" at least 10 days before the applicable
     Application  Date,  or cause to be applied an amount equal to any such "Net
     Available  Cash," then the Borrower  shall  immediately  pay or cause to be
     paid to the  Administrative  Agent an amount  equal to such "Net  Available
     Cash" to be applied to the payment of the Term B Advances in the manner set
     forth in Section  2.06(b)(ii)  in such amounts as shall excuse the Borrower
     from making any such "Offer".

          (vii) All prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be made together
     with  accrued  interest  to the date of such  prepayment  on the  principal
     amount  prepaid,  together  with any  amounts  owing  pursuant  to  Section
     9.04(c).

          SECTION 2.07. Interest. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrower shall pay
     interest  on the  unpaid  principal  amount of each  Advance  owing to each
     Lender from the date of such Advance until such  principal  amount shall be
     paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

               (i) Base Rate Advances.  During such periods as such Advance is a
          Base Rate  Advance,  a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of
          (A) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (B) the  Applicable
          Margin in effect from time to time,  payable in arrears  quarterly  on
          the last day of each March,  June,  September and December during such
          periods and on the date such Base Rate  Advance  shall be Converted or
          paid in full.

               (ii)  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances.  During  such  periods  as such
          Advance is a Eurodollar  Rate  Advance,  a rate per annum equal at all
          times  during  each  Interest  Period  for such  Advance to the sum of
          (A) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Advance plus
          (B) the  Applicable Margin in effect on the first day of such Interest
          Period,  payable in arrears  on the last day of such  Interest  Period
          and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months,
          on each day that occurs during such Interest Period
<PAGE>

          every three months from the first day of such  Interest  Period and on
          the date such  Eurodollar  Rate Advance  shall be Converted or paid in
          full.

          (b) Default  Interest.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
     of a Default under Section 6.01(a),  the Administrative Agent may, and upon
     the request of the Required  Lenders  shall,  require that the Borrower pay
     interest ("Default Interest") on (i) the unpaid overdue principal amount of
     each Advance  owing to each Lender  Party,  payable in arrears on the dates
     referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 2.07(a), as applicable, and on
     demand,  at a rate per annum  equal at all times to 2% per annum  above the
     rate per annum  required to be paid on such Advance  pursuant to clause (i)
     or (ii) of Section 2.07(a),  as applicable,  and (ii) to the fullest extent
     permitted  by  applicable  law,  the amount of any  interest,  fee or other
     amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to any Agent
     or any Lender  Party that is not paid when due,  from the date such  amount
     shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on
     the date such  amount  shall be paid in full and on  demand,  at a rate per
     annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum  required
     to be paid,  in the case of interest,  on the Type of Advance on which such
     interest has accrued pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of Section 2.07(a),  as
     applicable,  and, in all other  cases,  on Base Rate  Advances  pursuant to
     clause  (i) of Section  2.07(a);  provided,  however,  that  following  the
     acceleration  of the  Advances,  or the  giving  of  notice by the Agent to
     accelerate the Advances,  pursuant to Section 6.01,  Default Interest shall
     accrue and be payable hereunder  whether or not previously  required by the
     Administrative Agent.

          (c)  Notice of  Interest  Period and  Interest  Rate.  Promptly  after
     receipt of a Notice of Borrowing  pursuant to Section 2.02(a),  a notice of
     Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest
     Period  pursuant to the terms of the definition of "Interest  Period",  the
     Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and each Appropriate
     Lender of the applicable  Interest Period and the applicable  interest rate
     determined  by the  Administrative  Agent for purposes of clause  (a)(i) or
     (a)(ii) above.

          SECTION 2.08.  Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
     Administrative  Agent for the  account of the  Revolving  Credit  Lenders a
     commitment  fee, from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Lender
     and from the effective  date  specified in the  Assignment  and  Acceptance
     pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until
     the Termination Date,  payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each
     March, June,  September and December,  commencing June 30, 2004, and on the
     Termination  Date,  at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per annum on the average daily
     Unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender; provided,  however, that
     any  commitment  fee accrued  with respect to any of the  Commitments  of a
     Defaulting  Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a
     Defaulting  Lender  and  unpaid at such time  shall not be  payable  by the
     Borrower so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting  Lender except to the
     extent that such  commitment fee shall  otherwise have been due and payable
     by the Borrower prior to such time; and provided further that no commitment
     fee shall accrue on any of the  Commitments of a Defaulting  Lender so long
     as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender.

          (b) Letter of Credit  Fees,  Etc.  (i) The  Borrower  shall pay to the
     Administrative  Agent for the  account of each  Revolving  Credit  Lender a
     commission,  payable in arrears  quarterly  on the last day of each  March,
     June, September and December, commencing
<PAGE>

     June  30,  2004,  and  on the  earliest  to  occur  of  the  full  drawing,
     expiration,  termination or cancellation of any Letter of Credit and on the
     Termination  Date in  respect  of the  Letter of Credit  Facility,  on such
     Lender's  Pro Rata Share of the average daily  aggregate  Available  Amount
     during such quarter of (A) all Standby Letters of Credit  outstanding  from
     time to time at the Applicable  Margin for  Eurodollar  Rate Advances under
     the  Revolving  Credit  Facility and (B) all  Trade  Letters of Credit then
     outstanding at the rate of 0.20% per annum.  Upon the occurrence and during
     the continuance of a Default under Section  6.01(a) or 6.01(f),  the amount
     of  commission  payable by the Borrower  under this clause  (b)(i) shall be
     increased by 2% per annum on any overdue amounts.

          (ii) The Borrower  shall pay to the Issuing Bank, for its own account,
     (A) a  commission,  payable  in arrears  quarterly  on the last day of each
     March, June,  September and December,  commencing June 30, 2004, and on the
     Termination  Date in  respect  of the  Letter  of Credit  Facility,  on the
     average daily  aggregate  Available  Amount  during such quarter,  from the
     Effective  Date  until the  Termination  Date in  respect  of the Letter of
     Credit  Facility,  at the rate of 1/4 of 1% per  annum  and (B) such  other
     commissions, fronting fees, issuance fees, transfer fees and other fees and
     charges in connection with the issuance or administration of each Letter of
     Credit as the Borrower and the Issuing Bank shall agree.

          (c) Agents'  Fees.  The  Borrower  shall pay to each Agent for its own
     account  such fees as may from time to time be agreed  between the Borrower
     and such Agent.

          SECTION 2.09. Conversion of Advances.  (a) Optional.  The Borrower may
     on any  Business  Day,  upon notice given to the  Administrative  Agent not
     later than 11:00 A.M.  (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior
     to the date of the proposed  Conversion  and subject to the  provisions  of
     Section  2.10,  Convert  all or any  portion  of the  Advances  of one Type
     comprising the same  Borrowing  into Advances of the other Type;  provided,
     however,  that any  Conversion of  Eurodollar  Rate Advances into Base Rate
     Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest  Period for such
     Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  any  Conversion  of Base  Rate  Advances  into
     Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  shall be in an amount not less than the minimum
     amount  specified in  Section 2.02(c),  no Conversion of any Advances shall
     result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(c) and
     each Conversion of Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing under any
     Facility shall be made ratably among the Appropriate  Lenders in accordance
     with their Commitments under such Facility.  Each such notice of Conversion
     shall,  within the restrictions  specified  above,  specify (i) the date of
     such  Conversion,  (ii) the  Advances to be  Converted  and  (iii) if  such
     Conversion is into  Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  the duration of the initial
     Interest  Period for such  Advances.  Each  notice of  Conversion  shall be
     irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

          (b) Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal
     amount of  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  comprising  any  Borrowing  shall be
     reduced,  by payment or prepayment or otherwise,  to less than  $1,000,000,
     other  than by reason  of an  amortization  payment,  such  Advances  shall
     automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

          (ii) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
     Period for any Eurodollar  Rate Advances in accordance  with the provisions
     contained in the  definition  of  "Interest  Period" in  Section 1.01,  the
     Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower


<PAGE>

     and the  Appropriate  Lenders,  whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance
     will  automatically,  on the last day of the then existing  Interest Period
     therefor, Convert into a Eurodollar Rate Advance with an Interest Period of
     one month.

          (iii) Upon the occurrence  and during the  continuance of any Default,
     (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the
     then existing  Interest Period  therefor,  Convert into a Base Rate Advance
     and (y) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
     Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

          SECTION  2.10.  Increased  Costs,  Etc. (a) If, due to either  (i) the
     adoption  of or any  change  in or in  the  interpretation  of  any  law or
     regulation after the date of this Agreement or (ii) the compliance with any
     guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental  authority
     (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this  Agreement,
     there shall be any  increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to
     make or of making,  funding or maintaining  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or of
     agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or  participating in Letters
     of Credit or of  agreeing  to make or of  making or  maintaining  Letter of
     Credit Advances  (excluding,  for purposes of this  Section 2.10,  any such
     increased  costs  resulting  from  (x) Taxes  or Other  Taxes  (as to which
     Section  2.12 shall  govern)  and  (y) changes  in the basis of taxation of
     overall net income or overall  gross income by the United  States or by the
     foreign  jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender Party is
     organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision
     thereof),  then the Borrower  shall from time to time,  upon demand by such
     Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative  Agent), pay
     to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional
     amounts  sufficient  to  compensate  such Lender  Party for such  increased
     cost; provided,  however,  that the Borrower shall not be  responsible  for
     costs  under  this  Section  2.10(a)  arising  more than 180 days  prior to
     receipt  by the  Borrower  of the demand  from the  affected  Lender  Party
     pursuant to this Section  2.10(a).  A certificate  as to the amount of such
     increased  cost,  submitted to the Borrower by such Lender Party,  shall be
     conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (b) If any Lender Party  determines  that  compliance  with any law or
     regulation  or any  guideline  or request  from any  central  bank or other
     governmental  authority  (whether  or not  having  the force of law)  which
     becomes  effective after the date hereof affects or would affect the amount
     of capital  required or expected to be  maintained  by such Lender Party or
     any corporation  controlling  such Lender Party and that the amount of such
     capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender  Party's
     commitment  to lend  or to  issue  or  participate  in  Letters  of  Credit
     hereunder and other commitments of such type or the issuance or maintenance
     of or  participation  in the  Letters  of  Credit  (or  similar  contingent
     obligations) (and a similar reserve requirement is not already reflected in
     the  definition of  "Eurodollar  Rate"),  then,  upon demand by such Lender
     Party or such corporation (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative
     Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account
     of such Lender Party,  from time to time as specified by such Lender Party,
     additional  amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party in the light
     of such  circumstances,  to the extent  that such Lender  Party  reasonably
     determines  such  increase in capital to be allocable  to the  existence of
     such  Lender  Party's  commitment  to lend or to  issue or  participate  in
     Letters  of  Credit  hereunder  or to the  issuance  or  maintenance  of or
     participation in any Letters of Credit provided, further, that the Borrower
     shall not be responsible for costs under this Section 2.10(b) arising
<PAGE>

     more than 180 days prior to receipt by the  Borrower of the demand from the
     affected Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.10(b). A certificate as to
     such  amounts  submitted  to the  Borrower  by such  Lender  Party shall be
     conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (c)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this  Agreement,  if the
     adoption  of or any  change  in or in  the  interpretation  of  any  law or
     regulation   shall  make  it  unlawful,   or  any  central  bank  or  other
     governmental  authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
     its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations  hereunder to make
     Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate
     Advances  hereunder,  then, on notice  thereof and demand  therefor by such
     Lender  to  the  Borrower  through  the  Administrative   Agent,   (i) each
     Eurodollar  Rate Advance under each Facility  under which such Lender has a
     Commitment will automatically,  upon such demand,  Convert into a Base Rate
     Advance and (ii) the  obligation of the Appropriate  Lenders to make, or to
     Convert  Advances into,  Eurodollar  Rate Advances shall be suspended until
     the  Administrative  Agent shall notify the  Borrower  that such Lender has
     determined that the circumstances  causing such suspension no longer exist;
     provided,  however, that, before making any such demand, such Lender agrees
     to use reasonable  efforts  (consistent  with its internal policy and legal
     and regulatory  restrictions) to designate a different  Eurodollar  Lending
     Office if the making of such a  designation  would allow such Lender or its
     Eurodollar  Lending  Office to continue to perform its  obligations to make
     Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate
     Advances  and would not,  in the  judgment  of such  Lender,  be  otherwise
     disadvantageous to such Lender.

          SECTION 2.11.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make
     each payment  hereunder and under the Notes,  irrespective  of any right of
     counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15), not
     later  than  11:00 A.M.  (New York  City  time) on the day when due in U.S.
     dollars to the Administrative  Agent at the Administrative  Agent's Account
     in same day funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent
     after such time being deemed to have been  received on the next  succeeding
     Business   Day  for  purposes  of   calculating   interest   thereon.   The
     Administrative  Agent  will  promptly  thereafter  cause  like  funds to be
     distributed (i) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of principal,
     interest,  commitment fees or any other  Obligation then payable  hereunder
     and under the Notes to more than one Lender Party,  to such Lender  Parties
     for the account of their respective  Applicable  Lending Offices ratably in
     accordance with the amounts of such respective  Obligations then payable to
     such Lender  Parties and (ii) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect
     of any  Obligation  then  payable  hereunder to one Lender  Party,  to such
     Lender Party for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case
     to be  applied in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement.  Upon its
     acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
     contained  therein in the Register  pursuant to  Section 9.07(d),  from and
     after  the  effective  date  of  such   Assignment  and   Acceptance,   the
     Administrative  Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes
     in respect of the interest  assigned  thereby to the Lender Party  assignee
     thereunder,  and the parties to such  Assignment and Acceptance  shall make
     all  appropriate  adjustments  in such  payments for periods  prior to such
     effective date directly between themselves.

          (b) The Borrower  hereby  authorizes each Lender Party and each of its
     Affiliates,  if and to the extent  payment owed to such Lender Party is not
     made when due
<PAGE>

     hereunder or, in the case of a Lender,  under the Note held by such Lender,
     to charge  from  time to time,  to the  fullest  extent  permitted  by law,
     against any or all of the  Borrower's  accounts  with such Lender  Party or
     such Affiliate any amount so due; provided, that such Lender first confirms
     with the  Administrative  Agent that such  payment has not been made to the
     Administrative Agent.

          (c) All  computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made
     by the  Administrative  Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
     the case may be, and all  computations  of interest based on the Eurodollar
     Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit commissions
     shall be made by the  Administrative  Agent  on the  basis of a year of 360
     days, in each case for the actual number of days  (including  the first day
     but  excluding  the last  day)  occurring  in the  period  for  which  such
     interest,  fees or  commissions  are  payable.  Each  determination  by the
     Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall
     be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (d) Whenever any payment  hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated
     to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on
     the next succeeding  Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
     case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment or
     letter of credit fee or commission, as the case may be; provided,  however,
     that, if such extension  would cause payment of interest on or principal of
     Eurodollar  Rate Advances to be made in the next following  calendar month,
     such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

          (e) Unless the  Administrative  Agent shall have received  notice from
     the  Borrower  prior to the date on which any  payment is due to any Lender
     Party  hereunder  that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
     Administrative  Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in
     full to the Administrative  Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
     may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such
     Lender  Party on such due date an amount  equal to the amount then due such
     Lender Party. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such
     payment in full to the  Administrative  Agent, each such Lender Party shall
     repay  to  the  Administrative   Agent  forthwith  on  demand  such  amount
     distributed to such Lender Party together with interest  thereon,  for each
     day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender Party until the
     date such Lender Party repays such amount to the  Administrative  Agent, at
     the Federal Funds Rate.

          (f) Whenever any payment  received by the  Administrative  Agent under
     this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in
     full all amounts due and payable to the Agents and the Lender Parties under
     or in respect of this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents on any date,
     such payment shall be distributed by the  Administrative  Agent and applied
     by the Agents and the Lender Parties in the following order of priority:

               (i) first,  to the  payment  of all of the fees,  indemnification
          payments,  costs and  expenses  that are due and payable to the Agents
          (solely in their respective  capacities as Agents) under or in respect
          of this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents on such date,  ratably
          based  upon  the  respective  aggregate  amounts  of  all  such  fees,
          indemnification  payments,  costs and expenses  owing to the Agents on
          such date;
<PAGE>

               (ii) second,  to the payment of all of the fees,  indemnification
          payments,  costs and expenses  that are due and payable to the Issuing
          Bank and the Swing Line Bank (solely in their respective capacities as
          such)  under  or in  respect  of this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
          Documents on such date,  ratably based upon the  respective  aggregate
          amounts of all such fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses
          owing to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank on such date;

               (iii)  third,  to the  payment  of  all  of  the  indemnification
          payments,  costs and expenses  that are due and payable to the Lenders
          under Sections 9.04 hereof,  Section 20 of the Security  Agreement and
          any similar  section of any of the other Loan  Documents on such date,
          ratably  based  upon  the  respective  aggregate  amounts  of all such
          indemnification  payments,  costs and expenses owing to the Lenders on
          such date;

               (iv)  fourth,  to the payment of all of the amounts  that are due
          and payable to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lender Parties under
          Sections  2.10 and 2.12  hereof on such date,  ratably  based upon the
          respective aggregate amounts thereof owing to the Administrative Agent
          and the Lender Parties on such date;

               (v)  fifth,  to the  payment  of all of the fees that are due and
          payable to the Lenders  under  Section  2.08(a) on such date,  ratably
          based upon the respective  aggregate  Commitments of the Lenders under
          the Facilities on such date;

               (vi)  sixth,  to the  payment  of all of the  accrued  and unpaid
          interest on the Obligations of the Borrower under or in respect of the
          Loan Documents that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent and

          upon the  respective  aggregate  amounts of all such interest owing to
          the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;

               (vii)  seventh,  to the  payment of all of the accrued and unpaid
          interest on the Advances that is due and payable to the Administrative
          Agent and the  Lender  Parties  under  Section  2.07(a)  on such date,
          ratably  based  upon  the  respective  aggregate  amounts  of all such
          interest owing to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lender Parties on
          such date;

               (viii) eighth,  to the payment of the principal  amount of all of
          the outstanding Advances that is due and payable to the Administrative
          Agent and the  Lender  Parties on such  date,  ratably  based upon the
          respective  aggregate  amounts  of all  such  principal  owing  to the
          Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date; and

               (ix) ninth,  to the payment of all other  Obligations of the Loan
          Parties owing under or in respect of the Loan  Documents  that are due
          and payable to the Administrative  Agent and the other Secured Parties
          on such date,  ratably based upon the respective  aggregate amounts of
          all such Obligations owing to the  Administrative  Agent and the other
          Secured Parties on such date.

     If  the  Administrative   Agent  receives  funds  for  application  to  the
     Obligations  of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan  Documents
     under  circumstances  for  which  the Loan  Documents  do not  specify  the
     Advances or the Facility to which,  or the manner in which,  such funds are
     to
<PAGE>

     be applied,  the  Administrative  Agent may, but shall not be obligated to,
     elect to distribute  such funds to each of the Lender Parties in accordance
     with such  Lender  Party's  Pro Rata Share of the sum of (A) the  aggregate
     principal  amount  of all  Advances  outstanding  at such  time and (b) the
     aggregate  Available  Amount of all Letters of Credit  outstanding  at such
     time,  in repayment or prepayment  of such of the  outstanding  Advances or
     other  Obligations then owing to such Lender Party, and, in the case of the
     Term B Facility,  for application to such principal repayment  installments
     thereof, as the Administrative Agent shall direct.

          SECTION 2.12.  Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
     obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under the Notes or any other Loan
     Document  shall be made free and  clear of and  without  deduction  for any
     Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;  provided that if any Loan Party shall be
     required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments,
     then (i) the sum payable  shall be  increased  as  necessary  so that after
     making  all  required  deductions   (including   deductions  applicable  to
     additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or any
     Lender  Party (as the case may be)  receives an amount  equal to the sum it
     would have received had no such  deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party
     shall make such  deductions  and (iii)  such Loan Party  shall pay the full
     amount deducted to the relevant  Governmental  Authority in accordance with
     applicable law.

          (b) In  addition,  a Loan  Party  shall  pay any  Other  Taxes  to the
     relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative  Agent and each
     Lender Party,  within 10 days after written demand  therefor,  for the full
     amount of any Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the  Administrative
     Agent or such Lender  Party,  as the case may be, on or with respect to any
     payment by or on account of any obligation of such Loan Party  hereunder or
     under the Notes or under any other  Loan  Document  (including  Indemnified
     Taxes or Other  Taxes  imposed or asserted  on or  attributable  to amounts
     payable  under this  Section) and any  penalties,  interest and  reasonable
     expenses  arising  therefrom or with respect  thereto,  whether or not such
     Indemnified  Taxes or Other  Taxes were  correctly  or  legally  imposed or
     asserted by the relevant  Governmental  Authority.  A certificate as to the
     amount of such payment or  liability  delivered to a Loan Party by a Lender
     Party or the  Administrative  Agent on its own  behalf  or on  behalf  of a
     Lender Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d) As soon as practicable  after any payment of Indemnified  Taxes or
     Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority,  such Loan Party
     shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent the original or a certified copy
     of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
     a copy of the  return  reporting  such  payment or other  evidence  of such
     payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Any Foreign  Lender Party that is entitled to an exemption from or
     reduction of withholding  tax under the law of the  jurisdiction in which a
     Loan Party is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party,
     with respect to payments  under this  Agreement  shall deliver to such Loan
     Party  (with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent),  at the  time or  times
     prescribed  by  applicable  law,  such  properly   completed  and  executed
     documentation  prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such
     Loan Party as will permit such payments to be made without  withholding  or
     at a reduced rate; provided that such Foreign Lender has received
<PAGE>

     written notice from such Loan Party advising it of the availability of such
     exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

          SECTION  2.13.  Sharing of  Payments,  Etc. If any Lender  Party shall
     obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
     exercise of any right of set-off,  or otherwise,  other than as a result of
     an assignment  pursuant to Section 9.07)  (a) on account of Obligations due
     and  payable to such  Lender  Party  hereunder  and under the Notes and the
     other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according
     to the proportion of (i) the amount of such  Obligations due and payable to
     such  Lender  Party  hereunder  and under  the  Notes  and the  other  Loan
     Documents at such time to (ii) the  aggregate amount of the Obligations due
     and  payable to all Lender  Parties  hereunder  and under the Notes and the
     other  Loan  Documents  at  such  time)  of  payments  on  account  of  the
     Obligations  due and payable to all Lender Parties  hereunder and under the
     Notes at such  time  obtained  by all the  Lender  Parties  at such time or
     (b) on  account  of  Obligations  owing (but not due and  payable)  to such
     Lender Party  hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents at
     such time in excess of its ratable share  (according  to the  proportion of
     (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party hereunder and
     under  the  Notes and the other  Loan  Documents  at such time to  (ii) the
     aggregate amount of the Obligations  owing (but not due and payable) to all
     Lender  Parties  hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents
     at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations  owing (but not due
     and payable) to all Lender  Parties  hereunder  and under the Notes at such
     time obtained by all of the Lender Parties at such time,  such Lender Party
     shall  forthwith  purchase from the other Lender  Parties such interests or
     participating  interests  in the  Obligations  due and  payable or owing to
     them,  as the case may be, as shall be necessary  to cause such  purchasing
     Lender  Party  to share  the  excess  payment  ratably  with  each of them;
     provided,  however,  that if all or any portion of such  excess  payment is
     thereafter  recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from
     each other  Lender  Party shall be  rescinded  and such other  Lender Party
     shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent
     of such Lender  Party's  ratable  share  (according  to the  proportion  of
     (i) the  purchase  price paid to such Lender  Party to  (ii) the  aggregate
     purchase price paid to all Lender  Parties) of such recovery  together with
     an amount equal to such Lender  Party's  ratable  share  (according  to the
     proportion  of  (i) the  amount  of  such  other  Lender  Party's  required
     repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing  Lender
     Party) of any  interest or other  amount paid or payable by the  purchasing
     Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered;  provided further
     that, so long as the  Obligations  under the Loan Documents  shall not have
     been  accelerated,  any excess payment  received by any Appropriate  Lender
     shall be shared on a pro rata basis only with  other  Appropriate  Lenders.
     The  Borrower  agrees that any Lender  Party so  purchasing  an interest or
     participating   interest  from  another   Lender  Party  pursuant  to  this
     Section 2.13  may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
     rights of payment  (including  the right of set-off)  with  respect to such
     interest or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such
     Lender Party were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
     interest or participating interest, as the case may be.

          SECTION  2.14.  Use of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds of the  Advances  and
     issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Borrower  agrees
     that it shall use such  proceeds and Letters of Credit) to  consummate  the
     Refinancing, pay related transaction fees and expenses, and provide working
     capital  for  the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries  for  general  corporate
     purposes   which  shall   include  (w)  the  financing  of  the  Grupo  TFM
     Acquisition, (x) the financing of the
<PAGE>

     repayment   of  certain   intercompany   loans  (the   "Intercompany   Loan
     Repayment"),  (y) the  financing of the Grupo TFM  Investment in connection
     with the exercise by the federal  government of Mexico or any other Mexican
     governmental  entity of its put  option  with  respect  to  certain  Equity
     Interests in TFM, S.A. de C.V. (the "Mexican Put Option Financing") and (z)
     the financing of the Mexrail Acquisition.

          SECTION 2.15.  Defaulting Lenders.  (a)  In the event that, at any one
     time,  (i) any  Lender  Party  shall  be  a  Defaulting  Lender,  (ii) such
     Defaulting  Lender  shall  owe a  Defaulted  Advance  to the  Borrower  and
     (iii) the Borrower shall be required to make any payment hereunder or under
     any other Loan  Document to or for the account of such  Defaulting  Lender,
     then the Borrower  may, so long as no Default  shall occur or be continuing
     at such time and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, set off
     and otherwise  apply the Obligation of the Borrower to make such payment to
     or for the account of such Defaulting Lender against the obligation of such
     Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted Advance. In the event that, on any
     date, the Borrower  shall so set off and otherwise  apply its obligation to
     make any such payment against the obligation of such  Defaulting  Lender to
     make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such date, the amount so set
     off and otherwise applied by the Borrower shall constitute for all purposes
     of  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan  Documents  an  Advance  by such
     Defaulting  Lender  made on the  date of such  setoff  under  the  Facility
     pursuant to which such Defaulted  Advance was  originally  required to have
     been made pursuant to Section 2.01.  Such Advance shall be considered,  for
     all  purposes of this  Agreement,  to  comprise  part of the  Borrowing  in
     connection  with which such Defaulted  Advance was  originally  required to
     have  been  made  pursuant  to  Section 2.01,  even if the  other  Advances
     comprising  such  Borrowing  shall be Eurodollar  Rate Advances on the date
     such  Advance is deemed to be made  pursuant  to this  subsection (a).  The
     Borrower  shall  notify the  Administrative  Agent at any time the Borrower
     exercises its right of set-off  pursuant to this  subsection (a)  and shall
     set forth in such  notice  (A) the  name of the  Defaulting  Lender and the
     Defaulted Advance required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and (B) the
     amount set off and otherwise  applied in respect of such Defaulted  Advance
     pursuant  to this  subsection (a).  Any portion of such  payment  otherwise
     required  to be  made  by  the  Borrower  to or for  the  account  of  such
     Defaulting Lender which is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the
     amount set off and  otherwise  applied  by the  Borrower  pursuant  to this
     subsection (a),  shall be applied by the Administrative  Agent as specified
     in subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.15.

          (b) In the event that, at any one time,  (i) any Lender Party shall be
     a  Defaulting  Lender,  (ii) such  Defaulting  Lender shall owe a Defaulted
     Amount  to any  Agent or any of the  other  Lender  Parties  and  (iii) the
     Borrower shall make any payment  hereunder or under any other Loan Document
     to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then
     the  Administrative  Agent  may,  on its  behalf or on behalf of such other
     Agents or such other Lender Parties and to the fullest extent  permitted by
     applicable law, apply at such time the amount so paid by the Borrower to or
     for the  account  of such  Defaulting  Lender to the  payment  of each such
     Defaulted  Amount to the extent required to pay such Defaulted  Amount.  In
     the event that the  Administrative  Agent shall so apply any such amount to
     the payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount so applied
     by the  Administrative  Agent  shall  constitute  for all  purposes of this
     Agreement and the other Loan  Documents  payment,  to such extent,  of such
     Defaulted  Amount  on  such  date.  Any  such  amount  so  applied  by  the
     Administrative  Agent  shall be  retained  by the  Administrative  Agent or
     distributed by the
<PAGE>

     Administrative  Agent to such other  Agents or such other  Lender  Parties,
     ratably  in  accordance  with the  respective  portions  of such  Defaulted
     Amounts payable at such time to the Administrative Agent, such other Agents
     and such other  Lender  Parties  and, if the amount of such payment made by
     the  Borrower  shall  at such  time be  insufficient  to pay all  Defaulted
     Amounts owing at such time to the  Administrative  Agent, such other Agents
     and such other Lender Parties, in the following order of priority:

               (i) first, to the Agents for any Defaulted  Amounts then owing to
          them,  in their  capacities as such,  ratably in accordance  with such
          respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Agents;

               (ii) second,  to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank for any
          Defaulted  Amounts then owing to them,  in their  capacities  as such,
          ratably in  accordance  with such  respective  Defaulted  Amounts then
          owing to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank; and

               (iii)  third,  to any  other  Lender  Parties  for any  Defaulted
          Amounts then owing to such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance
          with such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lender
          Parties.

     Any  portion of such amount  paid by the  Borrower  for the account of such
     Defaulting Lender  remaining,  after giving effect to the amount applied by
     the Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b),  shall be applied
     by  the  Administrative  Agent  as  specified  in  subsection (c)  of  this
     Section 2.15.

          (c) In the event that, at any one time,  (i) any Lender Party shall be
     a Defaulting Lender,  (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a Defaulted
     Advance or a  Defaulted  Amount and  (iii) the  Borrower,  any Agent or any
     other  Lender  Party  shall be  required  to pay or  distribute  any amount
     hereunder  or under any other Loan  Document  to or for the account of such
     Defaulting  Lender,  then the  Borrower or such Agent or such other  Lender
     Party shall pay such amount to the  Administrative  Agent to be held by the
     Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in
     escrow or the  Administrative  Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted
     by  applicable  law, hold in escrow such amount  otherwise  held by it. Any
     funds held by the Administrative  Agent in escrow under this subsection (c)
     shall be  deposited by the  Administrative  Agent in an account with a bank
     (the "Escrow Bank") selected by the  Administrative  Agent, in the name and
     under  the  control  of  the  Administrative  Agent,  but  subject  to  the
     provisions of this  subsection (c).  The terms  applicable to such account,
     including the rate of interest  payable with respect to the credit  balance
     of such  account  from time to time,  shall be the Escrow  Bank's  standard
     terms  applicable  to escrow  accounts  maintained  with it.  Any  interest
     credited  to  such  account  from  time  to  time  shall  be  held  by  the
     Administrative  Agent in escrow  under,  and applied by the  Administrative
     Agent  from  time  to time in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of,  this
     subsection (c).  The  Administrative  Agent  shall,  to the fullest  extent
     permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so held in escrow from time to
     time to the extent  necessary to make any  Advances  required to be made by
     such  Defaulting  Lender and to pay any amount  payable by such  Defaulting
     Lender  hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to the  Administrative
     Agent or any other Lender  Party,  as and when such Advances or amounts are
     required to be made or paid and,  if the amount so held in escrow  shall at
     any time be insufficient
<PAGE>

     to make and pay all such  Advances and amounts  required to be made or paid
     at such time, in the following order of priority:

               (i) first,  to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable by
          such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder, in their capacities as such,
          ratably  in  accordance  with  such  respective  amounts  then due and
          payable to the Agents;

               (ii) second,  to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank for any
          amounts then due and payable to them hereunder, in their capacities as
          such,  by such  Defaulting  Lender,  ratably in  accordance  with such
          respective  amounts  then due and payable to the Issuing  Bank and the

          made  by such  Defaulting  Lender  pursuant  to a  Commitment  of such
          Defaulting Lender.

     In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting  Lender  shall,  at
     any  time,  cease  to  be a  Defaulting  Lender,  any  funds  held  by  the
     Administrative  Agent in escrow at such time with  respect  to such  Lender
     Party shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party
     and applied by such Lender  Party to the  Obligations  owing to such Lender
     Party at such  time  under  this  Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents
     ratably in  accordance  with the  respective  amounts  of such  Obligations
     outstanding at such time.

          (d) The rights and  remedies  against a  Defaulting  Lender under this
     Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower
     may have  against  such  Defaulting  Lender with  respect to any  Defaulted
     Advance  and that any  Agent or any  Lender  Party  may have  against  such
     Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

          SECTION 2.16.  Evidence of Debt.  (a) Each Lender Party shall maintain
     in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
     indebtedness  of the  Borrower to such Lender  resulting  from each Advance
     owing to such  Lender  Party from time to time,  including  the  amounts of
     principal  and  interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
     hereunder.  The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender Party to the
     Borrower  (with a copy of such notice to the  Administrative  Agent) to the
     effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required
     or  appropriate  in order for such Lender  Party to evidence  (whether  for
     purposes of pledge,  enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to
     be made by, such Lender  Party,  the Borrower  shall  promptly  execute and
     deliver to such Lender Party,  with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent, a
     Revolving  Credit Note and a Term B Note, as applicable,  in  substantially
     the form of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto, respectively, payable to the order
     of such Lender Party in a principal  amount equal to the  Revolving  Credit
     Commitment and the Term B Commitment,  respectively,  of such Lender Party.
     All references to Notes in the Loan Documents  shall mean Notes, if any, to
     the extent issued hereunder.

          (b) The Register  maintained by the  Administrative  Agent pursuant to
     Section 9.07(d)  shall include a control account,  and a subsidiary account
     for each Lender Party,
<PAGE>

     in which  accounts  (taken  together)  shall be recorded  (i) the  date and
     amount of each Borrowing made  hereunder,  the Type of Advances  comprising
     such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto,
     (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance  delivered to and accepted
     by it,  (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
     become due and payable from the  Borrower to each Lender  Party  hereunder,
     and (iv) the  amount of any sum received by the  Administrative  Agent from
     the Borrower hereunder and each Lender Party's share thereof.

          (c)  Entries  made in good  faith by the  Administrative  Agent in the
     Register  pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender Party in its
     account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above,  shall be prima facie
     evidence  of the amount of  principal  and  interest  due and payable or to
     become due and payable from the  Borrower to, in the case of the  Register,
     each Lender Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender
     Party, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that
     the failure of the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  Party to make an
     entry,  or any finding that an entry is incorrect,  in the Register or such
     account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise  affect the obligations of
     the Borrower under this Agreement.

          SECTION 2.17. Mitigation Obligations;  Replacement of Lenders. (a)  If
     any Lender requests  compensation under Section 2.10, or if the Borrower is
     required  to pay any  additional  amount to any Lender or any  Governmental
     Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.12, then such
     Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office
     for funding or booking its  Advances  hereunder or to assign its rights and
     obligations  hereunder to another of its offices,  branches or  affiliates,
     if, in the judgment of such Lender,  such  designation  or  assignment  (i)
     would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12,
     as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to
     any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous
     to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and
     expenses  incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
     assignment.

          (b) If any Lender requests  compensation under Section 2.10, or if the
     Borrower  is  required  to pay any  additional  amount to any Lender or any
     Governmental  Authority  for the account of any Lender  pursuant to Section
     2.12,  or if any Lender is a Defaulting  Lender,  then the Borrower may, at
     its  sole  expense  and  effort,   upon  notice  to  such  Lender  and  the
     Administrative  Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,  without
     recourse (in accordance with and subject to the  restrictions  contained in
     Section 9.07),  all of its  interests,  rights and  obligations  under this
     Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee
     may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);  provided that
     (i) the  Borrower  shall have  received  the prior  written  consent of the
     Administrative  Agent  (and,  if a  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  is being
     assigned,  the Issuing Bank and Swing Line Bank),  which  consent shall not
     unreasonably be withheld,  (ii) such Lender shall have received  payment of
     an  amount  equal  to  the  outstanding   principal  of  its  Advances  and
     participations  in  LC  Disbursements  and  Swing  Line  Advances,  accrued
     interest  thereon,  accrued  fees  and  all  other  amounts  payable  to it
     hereunder,  from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding  principal
     and accrued  interest  and fees) or the  Borrower (in the case of all other
     amounts)  and  (iii) in the case of any such  assignment  resulting  from a
     claim for compensation  under Section 2.10 or payments  required to be made
     pursuant  to  Section  2.12,  such  assignment  will  result in a  material
     reduction in such
<PAGE>

     compensation  or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such
     assignment and  delegation  if, prior  thereto,  as a result of a waiver by
     such Lender or  otherwise,  the  circumstances  entitling  the  Borrower to
     require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

<PAGE>

          requires it to so qualify or be licensed  except  where the failure to
          so qualify or be  licensed  would not be  reasonably  likely to have a
          Material   Adverse  Effect  and  (iii) has  all  requisite  power  and
          authority   (including,    without   limitation,    all   Governmental

          of the outstanding  Equity Interests in the Borrower have been validly
          issued,  are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by the Parent
          free and clear of all Liens, except those created under the Collateral
          Documents.

               (b) Set  forth  on  Schedule 4.01(b)  hereto  is a  complete  and

          such Loan  Party at the date  hereof.  All of the  outstanding  Equity
          Interests  in each Loan Party's  Subsidiaries  that are subject to the
          Security  Agreement  have been  validly  issued,  are  fully  paid and
          non-assessable  and are owned by such Loan Party or one or more of its
          Subsidiaries  free and clear of all Liens,  except those created under
          the Collateral Documents.

               (c) The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of
          each  Loan  Document  to  which  it is or is to be a  party,  and  the
          consummation of the Transaction,  are within such Loan Party's powers,

          created under the Loan Documents, result in or require the creation or
          imposition  of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the  properties
          of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries.  No Loan Party or any of
          its  Subsidiaries  is in violation of any such law, rule,  regulation,
          order, writ, judgment,  injunction,  decree, determination or award or
          in breach of any such contract, loan agreement,  indenture,  mortgage,

          which have been duly  obtained,  taken,  given or made and are in full
          force and effect.  All applicable  waiting  periods in connection with
          the  Transaction  have expired without any action having been taken by
          any competent authority restraining, preventing or imposing materially
          adverse  conditions  upon the  Transaction  or the  rights of the Loan
          Parties or their Subsidiaries  freely to transfer or otherwise dispose
          of, or to create any Lien on, any  properties  now owned or  hereafter
          acquired by any of them.

          Document  when  delivered  hereunder  will be,  the  legal,  valid and
          binding  obligation  of each Loan  Party  party  thereto,  enforceable
          against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms.

               (f)  There  is no  action,  suit,  investigation,  litigation  or
          proceeding  affecting  any  Loan  Party  or any  of its  Subsidiaries,
          including any Environmental  Action,  pending or threatened before any
          Governmental  Authority or  arbitrator  that  (i) could be  reasonably
          likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect or  (ii) purports  to affect
          the legality,  validity or  enforceability of any Loan Document or the
          consummation of the Transaction.

          (g) The Consolidated  balance sheet of the Parent and its subsidiaries

          furnished to each Lender Party,  fairly present,  subject, in the case
          of said balance sheet as at September 30, 2003, and said statements of
          income and cash flows for the nine  months  then  ended,  to  year-end
          audit adjustments,  the Consolidated financial condition of the Parent
          and its subsidiaries as at such dates and the Consolidated  results of
          operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries for the periods ended on

          and  since  December 31,  2002,  there  has been no  Material  Adverse
          Change.

               (i) The  Consolidated  forecasted  balance  sheet,  statement  of
          income and  statement  of cash  flows of Parent  and its  subsidiaries
          delivered to the Lender Parties pursuant to
<PAGE>

          Section 3.01(a)(viii) or 5.03 were prepared in good faith on the basis
          of the assumptions  stated  therein,  which  assumptions  were fair in
          light  of the  conditions  existing  at the time of  delivery  of such
          forecasts, and represented, at the time of delivery, the Parent's best
          estimate of its future financial performance.

               (j) Neither the Information Memorandum nor any other information,
          exhibit or report  furnished  by or on behalf of any Loan Party to any
          Agent or any  Lender  Party in  connection  with the  negotiation  and
          syndication of the Loan Documents or pursuant to the terms of the Loan
          Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
          to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made therein
          not misleading.

               (k) The  Borrower  is not engaged in the  business  of  extending
          credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock,  and no
          proceeds of any Advance or drawings under any Letter of Credit will be
          used to  purchase  or carry any  Margin  Stock or to extend  credit to
          others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

               (l)  Neither  any Loan  Party nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is an
          "investment  company",  or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or
          "principal  underwriter" for, an "investment  company",  as such terms
          are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither
          any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company",  or
          a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company",  or an "affiliate" of a
          "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company",
          as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
          1935, as amended. Neither the making of any Advances, nor the issuance
          of any  Letters of Credit,  nor the  application  of the  proceeds  or
          repayment  thereof by the Borrower,  nor the consummation of the other
          transactions  contemplated  by the Loan  Documents,  will  violate any
          provision  of any such  Act or any  rule,  regulation  or order of the
          Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.

               (m) Neither any Loan Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
          to any  indenture,  loan or  credit  agreement  or any  lease or other
          agreement  or  instrument  or  subject  to any  charter  or  corporate
          restriction that could be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
          Effect.

               (n) Upon the  filings of the  Mortgages  in  accordance  with the
          terms  of the Loan  Documents  and the  delivery  of  Account  Control
          Agreements in  accordance  with the terms of the Loan  Documents,  all
          filings  and other  actions  necessary  or  desirable  to perfect  and
          protect the  security  interest in the  Collateral  created  under the
          Collateral  Documents  have  been  duly  made or taken and are in full
          force and effect, and the Collateral  Documents create in favor of the
          Collateral  Agent for the benefit of the Secured  Parties a valid and,
          together  with such  filings  and other  actions,  perfected  security
          interest  in the  Collateral,  securing  the  payment  of the  Secured
          Obligations.  The Loan Parties are the legal and beneficial  owners of
          the  Collateral  free and clear of any Lien,  except for the liens and
          security interests created or permitted under the Loan Documents.

               (o) Each  Loan  Party  is,  individually  and  together  with its
          Subsidiaries, Solvent.

               (p) No ERISA  Event has  occurred  or is  reasonably  expected to
          occur that,  when taken  together with all other such ERISA Events for
          which liability is reasonably  expected to occur,  could reasonably be
          expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  The present value of
          all  accumulated  benefit  obligations  under each Plan  (based on the
          assumptions  used for purposes of  Statement  of Financial  Accounting
          Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
          statements  reflecting such amounts,  exceed by more than  $10,000,000
          the fair  market  value of the  assets of such Plan,  and the  present
          value of all accumulated  benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
          (based on the assumptions  used for purposes of Statement of Financial
          Accounting  Standards  No.  87) did  not,  as of the  date of the most
          recent financial  statements  reflecting such amounts,  exceed by more
          than  $20,000,000  the fair  market  value of the  assets  of all such
          underfunded Plans.

               (q) Except as otherwise set forth on  Schedule 4.01(q)  hereto or
          as  disclosed  in Parent's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
          year ended  December 31, 2002,  filed with the Securities and Exchange
          Commission  and  except  with  respect  to  any  other  matters  that,
          individually or in the aggregate,  could not reasonably be expected to
          result in a Material Adverse Effect,  neither Parent, the Borrower nor
          any other  Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any  Environmental
          Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other
          approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject
          to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim
          with  respect  to any  Environmental  Liability  or (iv)  to the  best

          for any Environmental Liability.

          caused to be filed all Tax returns  and reports  required to have been
          filed and has paid or caused  to be paid all  Taxes  required  to have
          been paid by it, except (a) any Taxes that are being contested in good
          faith  by  appropriate  proceedings  and  for  which  Parent  or  such
          Subsidiary,  as  applicable,  has  set  aside  on its  books  adequate
          reserves  or (b) to the  extent  that the  failure  to do so could not
          reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          accurate  list as of the date hereof of all Existing  Debt (other than

                      COVENANTS OF THE BORROWEr and parent

          SECTION  5.01.  Affirmative  Covenants.  So long as any Advance or any
     other  Obligation  of any Loan Party under any Loan  Document  shall remain
     unpaid, any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or any Lender Party shall
     have any Commitment hereunder, each of Parent and the Borrower will:

               (a) Compliance  with Laws, Etc.  Comply,  and cause each of their
          Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects,  with all applicable
          laws,  rules,  regulations  and orders,
<PAGE>

          such compliance to include, without limitation, compliance with ERISA,
          Environmental Laws, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
          Chapter of the  Organized  Crime Control Act of 1970,  the  Interstate
          Commerce Act and the Railway  Labor Act except where the failure to do
          so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) Payment of Taxes,  Etc. Pay and discharge,  and cause each of
          their Subsidiaries to pay and discharge,  before the same shall become
          delinquent,  (i) all taxes,  assessments and  governmental  charges or
          levies imposed upon it or upon its property and (ii) all lawful claims
          that,  if  unpaid,  might  by law  become a Lien  upon  its  property;
          provided,  however,  that neither the Parent,  the Borrower nor any of
          their Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax,
          assessment,  charge or claim that is being contested in good faith and
          by proper  proceedings and as to which appropriate  reserves are being
          maintained,  unless and until any Lien resulting therefrom attaches to
          its property and becomes enforceable against its other creditors.

               (c) Maintenance of Insurance.  Maintain,  and cause each of their
          Subsidiaries  to maintain,  insurance with  responsible  and reputable
          insurance  companies or associations in such amounts and covering such
          risks as is usually carried by companies engaged in similar businesses
          and owning  similar  properties in the same general areas in which the
          Parent, the Borrower or such Subsidiary operates.

               (d)  Preservation  of  Corporate  Existence,  Etc.  Preserve  and
          maintain,  and  cause  each of  their  Subsidiaries  to  preserve  and
          maintain, its existence,  legal structure, legal name, rights (charter
          and  statutory),   permits,   licenses,   approvals,   privileges  and
          franchises; provided, however, that the Parent, the Borrower and their
          Subsidiaries  may  consummate  any merger or  consolidation  permitted
          under  Section 5.02(d)  and provided  further that neither the Parent,
          the  Borrower  nor any of  their  Subsidiaries  shall be  required  to
          preserve any right, permit, license, approval,  privilege or franchise
          if the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Parent,  the  Borrower  or  such
          Subsidiary shall determine that the preservation  thereof is no longer
          desirable in the conduct of the  business of the Parent,  the Borrower
          or such  Subsidiary,  as the case may be, and that the loss thereof is
          not  disadvantageous  in  any  material  respect  to the  Parent,  the
          Borrower, such Subsidiary or the Lender Parties.

               (e) Visitation  Rights.  At any reasonable  time and from time to
          time, upon reasonable  notice,  permit any of the Agents or any of the
          Lender Parties,  or any agents or representatives  thereof, to examine
          and make copies of and abstracts from the records and books of account
          of, and visit the properties  of, the Parent,  the Borrower and any of
          their Subsidiaries,  and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts
          of the Parent,  the Borrower and any of their Subsidiaries with any of
          their officers or directors  provided that any such examinations shall
          be at the Lender's sole expense and the Lenders shall  coordinate  the
          timing of their visits through the Administrative Agent.

               (f) Keeping of Books.  Keep, and cause each of their Subsidiaries
          to keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and correct
          entries shall be made of all
<PAGE>

          financial  transactions and the assets and business of the Parent, the
          Borrower and each such  Subsidiary in  accordance  with GAAP in effect
          from time to time.

               (g) Maintenance of Properties,  Etc.  Maintain and preserve,  and
          cause each of their Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve,  all of its
          properties  that are used or useful in the conduct of its  business in
          good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

               (h)  Transactions  with  Affiliates.  Conduct,  and cause each of
          their Subsidiaries to conduct,  all transactions  otherwise  permitted
          under the Loan  Documents  with any of their  Affiliates on terms that
          are fair and reasonable and no less favorable to Parent,  the Borrower
          or such Subsidiary  than it would obtain in a comparable  arm's-length
          transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

               (i) Covenant to Guarantee Obligations and Give Security. Upon (x)
          the formation or acquisition of any Significant Subsidiary by any Loan
          Party or (y) the  acquisition  of any  material  property  by any Loan

          shall not already be subject to a perfected  first  priority  security
          interest  in favor of the  Collateral  Agent  for the  benefit  of the
          Secured Parties, then in each case at the Borrower's expense:

                    (i) in  connection  with the formation or  acquisition  of a

               acquisition,  cause each such  Subsidiary,  and cause each direct
               and  indirect  parent of such  Subsidiary  (if it has not already
               done so), to duly execute and deliver to the  Collateral  Agent a
               guaranty  or   guaranty   supplement,   in  form  and   substance
               satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, guaranteeing the other Loan
               Parties' obligations under the Loan Documents,

                    (ii)  within 30 days after such  formation  or  acquisition,
               furnish to the  Collateral  Agent a  description  of the real and
               personal  properties of such  Subsidiary or the real and personal
               properties so acquired,  in each case in detail  satisfactory  to
               the Collateral Agent,

                    (iii)  within  60 days  after  (A) such  acquisition  of any
               material  property by any Loan Party,  duly  execute and deliver,
               and cause the applicable  Loan Party to duly execute and deliver,
               to the  Collateral  Agent  such  additional  mortgages,  pledges,
               assignments,   security   agreement   supplements,   intellectual
               property  security  agreement   supplements  and  other  security
               agreements as reasonably  requested by, and in form and substance

               Documents and  constituting  Liens on all such properties and (B)
               formation or acquisition of any new Significant Subsidiary, cause

<PAGE>

               of all of the  obligations  of such  Subsidiary  under  the  Loan
               Documents,  and cause  the  applicable  Loan  Party and each such
               Significant Subsidiary to take, whatever action may be reasonably
               necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Collateral  Agent to
               vest in the  Collateral  Agent (or in any  representative  of the
               Collateral  Agent designated by it) valid and subsisting Liens on
               the properties purported to be subject to the mortgages, pledges,

               property security agreement  supplements and security  agreements

               deliver to the Collateral Agent,  upon the reasonable  request of
               the  Collateral  Agent,  a signed  copy of a  favorable  opinion,

               of counsel  for the Loan  Parties  acceptable  to the  Collateral
               Agent as to (1) the matters  contained in  clauses (i)  and (iii)
               above,  (2) such  guaranties,  guaranty  supplements,  mortgages,
               pledges,    assignments,    security    agreement    supplements,

               Loan Party party thereto  enforceable  in  accordance  with their
               terms,  (3) any recordings,  filings,  notices,  endorsements and
               other actions taken pursuant  thereto being  sufficient to create
               valid  perfected  Liens on such  properties,  and (4) such  other
               matters as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request,

               (v) as promptly as practicable  after such request,  formation or
               acquisition, deliver, upon the request of the Collateral Agent in
               its reasonable  credit  judgment,  to the  Collateral  Agent with
               respect to each parcel of real property with a value in excess of
               $500,000  owned or held by the  applicable  Loan  Party  and each
               newly  acquired  or newly  formed  Significant  Subsidiary  title
               reports,  surveys and engineering,  soils and other reports,  and
               environmental   assessment  reports,  each  in  scope,  form  and
               substance  reasonably   satisfactory  to  the  Collateral  Agent,
               provided,  however, that to the extent that any Loan Party or any
               of its  Subsidiaries  shall have  otherwise  received  any of the
               foregoing  items with respect to such real  property,  such items
               shall,  promptly after the receipt  thereof,  be delivered to the
               Collateral Agent, and

                    (vi) at any time and from time to time, promptly execute and
               deliver,  and cause to execute and  deliver,  each Loan Party and
               each newly  acquired or newly formed  Significant  Subsidiary any
               and all further  instruments  and documents  and take,  and cause
               each  Loan  Party  and  each  newly   acquired  or  newly  formed
               Significant  Subsidiary  to take,  all such  other  action as the
               Collateral  Agent may deem  reasonably  necessary or desirable to
               obtain the full benefits of, or in perfecting  and preserving the
               Liens  of,  such  guaranties,  mortgages,  pledges,  assignments,
               security agreement  supplements,  intellectual  property security
               agreement supplements and security agreements; provided, however,
               that  nothing in this clause (i) shall  require  the  creation or
               perfection of pledges or security  interests in particular assets
               of the Loan Parties if the Collateral Agent shall have determined
               that the cost of  creation  and  perfection  of
<PAGE>

               such  pledges or security  interests  is excessive in view of the
               benefit to be obtained by the Lenders.

               (j) Further  Assurances.  (i) Promptly upon request by any Agent,
          or any Lender Party through the  Administrative  Agent,  correct,  and

          defect or error that may be  discovered in any Loan Document or in the
          execution, acknowledgment, filing or recordation thereof, and

               (ii)  Promptly  upon  request by any Agent,  or any Lender  Party
          through the Administrative Agent, do, execute,  acknowledge,  deliver,
          record, re-record, file, re-file, register and re-register any and all
          such further acts, deeds, conveyances,  pledge agreements,  mortgages,
          deeds of trust,  trust deeds,  assignments,  financing  statements and
          continuations thereof, termination statements,  notices of assignment,
          transfers,  certificates,  assurances  and  other  instruments  as any
          Agent,  or any Lender  Party  through the  Administrative  Agent,  may
          reasonably  require from time to time in order to  (A) carry  out more
          effectively  the  purposes of the Loan  Documents,  (B) to the fullest
          extent permitted by applicable law, subject any Loan Party's or any of
          its Subsidiaries' properties, assets, rights or interests to the Liens
          now or  hereafter  intended  to be  covered  by any of the  Collateral
          Documents,  (C) perfect and maintain the validity,  effectiveness  and
          priority  of any of the  Collateral  Documents  and  any of the  Liens
          intended  to be created  thereunder  and  (D) assure,  convey,  grant,
          assign, transfer,  preserve, protect and confirm more effectively unto
          the Secured Parties the rights granted or now or hereafter intended to
          be granted to the Secured Parties under any Loan Document or under any
          other  instrument  executed in  connection  with any Loan  Document to
          which  any  Loan  Party  or any of its  Subsidiaries  is or is to be a
          party, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to do so.

               (k) Delivery of  Environmental  Reports.  Promptly provide to the
          Administrative  Agent or the Collateral  Agent,  at the expense of the
          Borrower,  copies of any environmental  site assessment report for the
          Parent,  the  Borrower  or  any  of  their  Subsidiaries'   properties
          described  in the  Mortgages,  indicating  the  presence or absence of
          Hazardous  Materials in any material respect and the estimated cost of
          any  compliance,  removal or remedial  action in  connection  with any
          Hazardous Materials on such properties.

               (l) Account Control Agreements. By the date that is 30 days after
          the  Effective  Date,  as such  time  period  may be  extended  in the

          trust, trust deeds, mortgages, leasehold mortgages and leasehold deeds
          of trust in  substantially  the form of  Exhibit E  hereto  (with such

               or  recording  offices  that the  Administrative  Agent  may deem
               necessary  or  desirable  in order to  create a valid  first  and
               subsisting Lien on the property described therein in favor of the
               Collateral  Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and that
               all filing and recording taxes and fees have been paid,

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

          SECTION  6.01.  Events  of  Default.  If any of the  following  events
     ("Events of Default") shall occur and be continuing:

               (a) (i) the  Borrower  shall  fail  to pay any  principal  of any
          Advance  when  the  same  shall  become  due and  payable  or (ii) the
          Borrower  shall fail to pay any interest on any  Advance,  or any Loan
          Party shall fail to make any other payment under any Loan Document, in
          each case under this clause (ii) within five  Business  Days after the
          same shall become due and payable; or

               (b) any representation or warranty made by any Loan Party (or any
          of its officers)  under or in connection  with any Loan Document shall
          prove to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

               (c) Parent or the  Borrower  shall fail to perform or observe any
          term, covenant or agreement contained in Section 2.14,  5.01(d),  (e),
          5.02, 5.03 or 5.04; or

               (d) any Loan Party  shall  fail to  perform or observe  any other
          term, covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document on its part
          to be performed or observed if such  failure  shall remain  unremedied
          for 15 days after written  notice thereof shall have been given to the
          Borrower by any Agent or any Lender Party; or

               (e) any Loan Party or any of its  Subsidiaries  shall fail to pay
          any principal of,  premium or interest on or any other amount  payable
          in respect of any Material Debt of such Loan Party or such  Subsidiary
          (as  the  case  may  be)  that  is  outstanding  (but  excluding  Debt
          outstanding hereunder), when the same becomes due and payable (whether
          by scheduled maturity,  required prepayment,  acceleration,  demand or
          otherwise), and such failure shall continue after the applicable grace
          period, if any,  specified in the agreement or instrument  relating to
          such Debt;  or any other event shall  occur or  condition  shall exist
          under any agreement or instrument  relating to any such Debt and shall
          continue after the applicable grace period, if any,  specified in such
          agreement or  instrument,  if the effect of such event or condition is
          to accelerate,  or to permit the acceleration of, the maturity of such
          Debt or otherwise to cause,  or to permit the holder thereof to cause,
          such Debt to mature;  or any such Debt shall be declared to be due and
          payable  or  required  to be  prepaid  or  redeemed  (other  than by a
          regularly scheduled required  prepayment or redemption),  purchased or
          defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease such Debt
          shall  be  required  to be made,  in each  case  prior  to the  stated
          maturity thereof; or

               (f) any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall generally not
          pay its debts as such debts  become due, or shall admit in writing its
          inability  to pay  its  debts  generally,  or  shall  make  a  general
          assignment for the benefit of creditors;  or any  proceeding  shall be
          instituted  by or against  any Loan  Party or any of its  Subsidiaries
          seeking  to  adjudicate  it  a  bankrupt  or  insolvent,   or  seeking
          liquidation,  winding  up,  reorganization,  arrangement,
<PAGE>

          adjustment,  protection,  relief,  or  composition  of it or its debts
          under any law relating to bankruptcy,  insolvency or reorganization or
          relief of debtors,  or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the
          appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or
          for any substantial  part of its property and, in the case of any such
          proceeding  instituted  against it (but not  instituted by it) that is
          being diligently contested by it in good faith, either such proceeding
          shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 days or any of
          the actions sought in such proceeding (including,  without limitation,
          the entry of an order for  relief  against,  or the  appointment  of a
          receiver,  trustee, custodian or other similar official for, it or any
          substantial  part of its property)  shall occur;  or any Loan Party or
          any of its  Subsidiaries  shall take any corporate action to authorize
          any of the actions set forth above in this subsection (f); or

               (g)  any  judgments  or  orders,  either  individually  or in the
          aggregate,  for the payment of money in excess of $10,000,000 shall be
          rendered  against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries and either
          (i) enforcement  proceedings shall have been commenced by any creditor
          upon such  judgment or order or  (ii) there  shall be any period of 30
          consecutive  days during which a stay of  enforcement of such judgment
          or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise,  shall not be in
          effect; or

               (h) any non-monetary  judgment or order shall be rendered against
          any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to
          have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  and there shall be any period of 60
          consecutive  days during which a stay of  enforcement of such judgment
          or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise,  shall not be in
          effect; or

               (i) any provision of any Loan  Document  after  delivery  thereof
          pursuant to  Section 3.01  or 5.01(i) shall for any reason cease to be
          valid and  binding on or  enforceable  against any Loan Party party to
          it, or any such Loan Party shall so state in writing; or

               (j) any Collateral Document or financing statement after delivery
          thereof  pursuant  to  Section 3.01  or  5.01(i)  shall for any reason
          (other than pursuant to the terms thereof) cease to create a valid and
          perfected  first priority lien on and security  interest in a material
          portion of the Collateral purported to be covered thereby; or

               (k) a Change of Control shall occur;

               (l) any ERISA Event shall have occurred  which, in the opinion of
          the Required Lenders,  could reasonably be expected to have a Material
          Adverse Effect.; or

               (m) an event of default or  purchase  termination  event or other
          comparable  event  shall  occur  in  respect  of  any   Securitization
          Transaction in an aggregate  amount greater than  $20,000,000,  in any
          case that could  reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
          effect on the liquidity of the Borrower or any of its  Subsidiaries or
          otherwise result in a Material Adverse Effect;

     then,  and in any such event,  the  Administrative  Agent  (i) shall at the
     request, or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the
     Borrower,  declare the  Commitments of each
<PAGE>

     Lender  Party and the  obligation  of each  Lender  Party to make  Advances
     (other  than Letter of Credit  Advances by the Issuing  Bank or a Revolving
     Credit  Lender  pursuant to  Section 2.03(c)  and Swing Line  Advances by a
     Revolving  Credit Lender  pursuant to  Section 2.02(b))  and of the Issuing
     Bank to issue Letters of Credit to be terminated,  whereupon the same shall
     forthwith  terminate,  and  (ii) shall  at the  request,  or may  with  the
     consent,  of the Required Lenders,  (A) by notice to the Borrower,  declare
     the Notes,  all interest  thereon and all other amounts  payable under this
     Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents to be  forthwith  due and payable,
     whereupon  the Notes,  all such  interest and all such amounts shall become
     and be forthwith due and payable,  without presentment,  demand, protest or
     further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
     Borrower,  (B) by  notice  to each  party  required  under the terms of any
     agreement in support of which a Standby Letter of Credit is issued, request
     that  all  Obligations  under  such  agreement  be  declared  to be due and
     payable; provided,  however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry
     of an order for relief  with  respect  to the  Borrower  under the  Federal
     Bankruptcy  Code,  (x) the   Commitments  of  each  Lender  Party  and  the
     obligation  of each  Lender  Party to make  Advances  (other than Letter of
     Credit  Advances by the Issuing Bank or a Revolving  Credit Lender pursuant
     to  Section 2.03(c)  and Swing Line  Advances by a Revolving  Credit Lender
     pursuant to  Section 2.02(b))  and of the Issuing Bank to issue  Letters of
     Credit  shall  automatically  be  terminated  and (y) the  Notes,  all such
     interest and all such  amounts  shall  automatically  become and be due and
     payable,  without presentment,  demand,  protest or any notice of any kind,
     all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

          SECTION  6.02.  Actions  in  Respect  of the  Letters  of Credit  upon
     Default. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
     Administrative  Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders,
     irrespective  of  whether  it is taking  any of the  actions  described  in
     Section 6.01 or otherwise,  make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith
     upon such demand the Borrower will,  pay to the Collateral  Agent on behalf
     of the Lender Parties in same day funds at the Collateral  Agent's  Office,
     for deposit in the L/C Collateral Account, an amount equal to the aggregate
     Available  Amount of all  Letters  of Credit  then  outstanding;  provided,
     however,  that in the event of an  actual  or deemed  entry of an order for
     relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy  Law, the Borrower
     will pay to the  Collateral  Agent on behalf of the Lender  Parties in same
     day  funds  at the  Collateral  Agent's  Office,  for  deposit  in the  L/C
     Collateral  Account,  an amount equal to the aggregate  Available Amount of
     all  Letters  of Credit  then  outstanding,  without  presentment,  demand,
     protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived
     by the Borrower.  If at any time the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
     Agent  determines  that any funds held in the L/C  Collateral  Account  are
     subject to any right or claim of any  Person  other than the Agents and the
     Lender  Parties  or that the total  amount  of such  funds is less than the
     aggregate  Available  Amount of all Letters of Credit,  the Borrower  will,
     forthwith upon demand by the Administrative  Agent or the Collateral Agent,
     pay to the Collateral  Agent, as additional  funds to be deposited and held
     in the L/C  Collateral  Account,  an amount equal to the excess of (a) such
     aggregate Available Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then
     held in the L/C  Collateral  Account that the  Administrative  Agent or the
     Collateral  Agent,  as the case may be,  determines to be free and clear of
     any such  right and  claim.  Upon the  drawing  of any Letter of Credit for
     which funds are on deposit in the L/C Collateral Account,  such funds shall
     be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or Revolving  Credit  Lenders,  as
     applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                   THE AGENTS

          SECTION 7.01.  Authorization and Action. (a) Each Lender Party (in its
     capacities as a Lender,  the Swing Line Bank (if  applicable),  the Issuing
     Bank  (if  applicable)  and on  behalf  of  itself  and its  Affiliates  as
     potential  Hedge Banks) hereby  appoints and authorizes  each Agent to take
     such  action  as  agent on its  behalf  and to  exercise  such  powers  and
     discretion  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents  as are
     delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
     powers and  discretion  as are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  As to any
     matters  not  expressly  provided  for by the  Loan  Documents  (including,
     without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), no Agent shall
     be required to exercise  any  discretion  or take any action,  but shall be
     required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully  protected in
     so acting or refraining from acting) upon the  instructions of the Required
     Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and
     all holders of Notes; provided, however, that no Agent shall be required to
     take any action that  exposes  such Agent to personal  liability or that is
     contrary to this Agreement or applicable  law. Each Agent agrees to give to
     each Lender Party prompt  notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower
     pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

          (b) In  furtherance  of the  foregoing,  each  Lender  Party  (in  its
     capacities as a Lender,  the Swing Line Bank (if  applicable),  the Issuing
     Bank  (if  applicable)  and on  behalf  of  itself  and its  Affiliates  as
     potential Hedge Banks) hereby appoints and authorizes the Collateral  Agent
     to act as the agent of such Lender Party for purposes of acquiring, holding
     and enforcing  any and all Liens on  Collateral  granted by any of the Loan
     Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers
     and discretion as are reasonably  incidental  thereto.  In this connection,
     the Collateral Agent (and any Supplemental  Collateral  Agents appointed by
     the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) for purposes of holding or
     enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under
     the  Collateral  Documents,  or  for  exercising  any  rights  or  remedies
     thereunder at the direction of the Collateral Agent),  shall be entitled to
     the benefits of this Article VII (including,  without  limitation,  Section
     7.05 as though such  Supplemental  Collateral  Agents were an "Agent" under
     the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

          (c) Any Agent may execute any of its duties  under this  Agreement  or
     any other Loan Document (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any
     Lien  on  the  Collateral  (or  any  portion  thereof)  granted  under  the
     Collateral Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at
     the direction of the Collateral  Agent) by or through agents,  employees or
     attorneys-in-fact  and shall be  entitled  to advice of  counsel  and other
     consultants or experts  concerning  all matters  pertaining to such duties.
     The Collateral  Agent may also from time to time, when the Collateral Agent
     deems  it to be  necessary  or  desirable,  appoint  one or more  trustees,
     co-trustees,     collateral    co-agents,     collateral    subagents    or
     attorneys-in-fact (each, a "Supplemental Collateral Agent") with respect to
     all  or any  part  of the  Collateral;  provided,  however,  that  no  such
     Supplemental  Collateral  Agent shall be authorized to take any action with
     respect  to any  Collateral  unless  and  except  to the  extent  expressly
     authorized in writing by the  Collateral  Agent.  Should any  instrument in
     writing  from the  Borrower  or any other  Loan  Party be  required  by any
     Supplemental  Collateral Agent so appointed by the Collateral Agent to more
<PAGE>

     fully or  certainly  vest in and  confirm to such  Supplemental  Collateral
     Agent such rights,  powers,  privileges and duties,  the Borrower shall, or
     shall cause such Loan Party to,  execute,  acknowledge  and deliver any and
     all such instruments  promptly upon request by the Collateral Agent. If any
     Supplemental  Collateral  Agent,  or successor  thereto,  shall die, become
     incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all rights,  powers,  privileges
     and duties of such  Supplemental  Collateral Agent, to the extent permitted
     by law,  shall  automatically  vest in and be exercised  by the  Collateral
     Agent until the  appointment of a new  Supplemental  Collateral  Agent.  No
     Agent shall be  responsible  for the negligence or misconduct of any agent,
     attorney-in-fact  or  Supplemental  Collateral  Agent  that it  selects  in
     accordance  with the foregoing  provisions  of this Section  7.01(c) in the
     absence of such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          SECTION  7.02.  Agents'  Reliance,  Etc.  Neither any Agent nor any of
     their respective directors,  officers,  agents or employees shall be liable
     for any  action  taken or  omitted  to be  taken by it or them  under or in
     connection  with the Loan  Documents,  except  for its or their  own  gross
     negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without limitation of the generality of
     the  foregoing,  each  Agent:  (a) may  treat  the payee of any Note as the
     holder  thereof  until,  in the  case  of  the  Administrative  Agent,  the
     Administrative  Agent  receives and accepts an  Assignment  and  Acceptance
     entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and
     an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, or, in the case of any other Agent, such
     Agent  has  received  notice  from  the  Administrative  Agent  that it has
     received and  accepted  such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  in each case as
     provided in  Section 9.07;  (b) may  consult with legal counsel  (including
     counsel  for any Loan  Party),  independent  public  accountants  and other
     experts  selected  by it and shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or
     omitted  to be taken in good faith by it in  accordance  with the advice of
     such   counsel,   accountants   or  experts;   (c) makes   no  warranty  or
     representation  to any  Lender  Party and shall not be  responsible  to any
     Lender Party for any  statements,  warranties or  representations  (whether
     written  or  oral)  made  in or in  connection  with  the  Loan  Documents;
     (d) shall  not  have  any  duty  to  ascertain  or to  inquire  as  to  the
     performance,  observance or satisfaction of any of the terms,  covenants or
     conditions  of any  Loan  Document  on the  part of any  Loan  Party or the
     existence at any time of any Default under the Loan Documents or to inspect
     the property (including the books and records) of any Loan Party; (e) shall
     not be  responsible  to any Lender Party for the due  execution,  legality,
     validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency  or value  of, or the
     perfection  or  priority  of any  lien  or  security  interest  created  or
     purported to be created under or in connection  with,  any Loan Document or
     any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;  and (f) shall
     incur no liability  under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon
     any notice, consent,  certificate or other instrument or writing (which may
     be by telegram,  telecopy or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed
     or sent by the proper party or parties.

          SECTION 7.03. BNS, Morgan Stanley and Affiliates.  With respect to its
     Commitments,  the  Advances  made by it and the Notes issued to it, BNS and
     Morgan  Stanley  shall  have the same  rights  and  powers  under  the Loan
     Documents  as any other Lender Party and may exercise the same as though it
     were not an Agent;  and the term "Lender Party" or "Lender  Parties" shall,
     unless  otherwise  expressly  indicated,  include BNS and Morgan Stanley in
     their respective  individual  capacities.  BNS and Morgan Stanley and their
     respective  affiliates  may  accept  deposits  from,  lend money to, act as
     trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and
     generally  engage in any kind of business with, any Loan Party,  any of its
     Subsidiaries  and any Person that may do business with or own securities of
     any Loan Party or
<PAGE>

     any such  Subsidiary,  all as if BNS and Morgan Stanley were not Agents and
     without any duty to account therefor to the Lender Parties.  No Agent shall
     have any duty to disclose any information obtained or received by it or any
     of its Affiliates  relating to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries to
     the extent such  information was obtained or received in any capacity other
     than as such Agent.

          SECTION  7.04.  Lender  Party  Credit  Decision.   Each  Lender  Party
     acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent
     or any other Lender Party and based on the financial statements referred to
     in  Section 4.01  and such other documents and information as it has deemed
     appropriate,  made its own credit  analysis and decision to enter into this
     Agreement.  Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will, independently
     and without  reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender Party and based on
     such documents and  information  as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,
     continue to make its own credit  decisions  in taking or not taking  action
     under this Agreement.

          SECTION 7.05. Indemnification.  (a) Each Lender Party severally agrees
     to  indemnify  each  Agent (to the extent not  promptly  reimbursed  by the
     Borrower) from and against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as
     provided below) of any and all liabilities,  obligations,  losses, damages,
     penalties,  actions,  judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
     any kind or nature  whatsoever  that may be  imposed  on,  incurred  by, or
     asserted  against  such Agent in any way  relating to or arising out of the
     Loan  Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under the Loan
     Documents (collectively,  the "Indemnified Costs"); provided, however, that
     no  Lender  Party  shall be liable  for any  portion  of such  liabilities,
     obligations,  losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
     expenses or  disbursements  resulting from such Agent's gross negligence or
     willful misconduct as found in a final,  non-appealable judgment by a court
     of competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender
     Party agrees to reimburse  each Agent  promptly upon demand for its ratable
     share of any costs and expenses  (including,  without limitation,  fees and
     expenses of counsel)  payable by the Borrower  under  Section  9.04, to the
     extent  that  such  Agent is not  promptly  reimbursed  for such  costs and
     expenses by the Borrower.  In the case of any investigation,  litigation or
     proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05  applies
     whether any such investigation,  litigation or proceeding is brought by any
     Lender Party or any other Person.

          (b) Each Lender Party  severally  agrees to indemnify the Issuing Bank
     (to the extent not promptly  reimbursed by the  Borrower)  from and against
     such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any and
     all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
     judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
     whatsoever  that may be imposed on,  incurred  by, or asserted  against the
     Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or
     any action taken or omitted by the Issuing  Bank under the Loan  Documents;
     provided,  however, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of
     such  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,
     judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or  disbursements  resulting  from the
     Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful  misconduct as found in a final,
     non-appealable  judgment  by a court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  Without
     limitation  of the  foregoing,  each Lender Party  agrees to reimburse  the
     Issuing Bank  promptly  upon demand for its ratable  share of any costs and
     expenses  (including,  without  limitation,  fees and  expenses of counsel)
     payable by the Borrower  under Section 9.04, to the
<PAGE>

     extent that the Issuing Bank is not promptly  reimbursed for such costs and
     expenses by the Borrower.

          (c) For purposes of this Section 7.05,  the Lender Parties' respective
     ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time, according to
     the sum of (i) the aggregate  principal amount of the Advances  outstanding
     at such  time  and  owing  to the  respective  Lender  Parties,  (ii) their
     respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters
     of Credit outstanding at such time,  (iii) the aggregate unused portions of
     their respective Term B Commitments at such time and (iv) their  respective
     Unused  Working  Capital  Commitments  at  such  time;  provided  that  the
     aggregate  principal  amount of Swing Line Advances owing to the Swing Line
     Bank and of Letter of Credit  Advances  owing to the Issuing  Bank shall be
     considered to be owed to the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance
     with their  respective  Revolving  Credit  Commitments.  The failure of any
     Lender Party to reimburse  any Agent or the Issuing  Bank,  as the case may
     be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be
     paid by the Lender  Parties to such Agent or the Issuing  Bank, as the case
     may be, as provided  herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of its
     obligation  hereunder to reimburse  such Agent or the Issuing  Bank, as the
     case may be, for its  ratable  share of such  amount,  but no Lender  Party
     shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse
     such Agent or the Issuing  Bank,  as the case may be, for such other Lender
     Party's ratable share of such amount.  Without prejudice to the survival of
     any other  agreement  of any Lender  Party  hereunder,  the  agreement  and
     obligations  of each Lender  Party  contained  in this  Section 7.05  shall
     survive the payment in full of  principal,  interest and all other  amounts
     payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

          SECTION 7.06.  Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign as to any or all
     of the  Facilities  at any time by giving  written  notice  thereof  to the
     Lender  Parties  and  the  Borrower  and  may be  removed  as to all of the
     Facilities  at any time  with or  without  cause by the  Required  Lenders;
     provided, however, that any removal of the Administrative Agent will not be
     effective until it has also been replaced as Collateral  Agent,  Swing Line
     Bank  and  Letter  of  Credit  Issuing  Bank and  released  from all of its
     obligations in respect thereof.  Upon any such resignation or removal,  the
     Required  Lenders  shall have the right with the  approval of the  Borrower
     (such  approval  not to be  unreasonably  withheld)  to appoint a successor
     Agent as to such of the  Facilities  as to which such Agent has resigned or
     been  removed.  If no  successor  Agent shall have been so appointed by the
     Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment,  within 30 days
     after the retiring  Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required
     Lenders'  removal of the retiring  Agent,  then the retiring  Agent may, on
     behalf of the Lender  Parties,  with the  approval  of the  Borrower  (such
     approval not to be unreasonably  withheld) appoint a successor Agent, which
     shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or
     of any State thereof and having a combined  capital and surplus of at least
     $250,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by
     a  successor  Agent  as to all of the  Facilities  and,  in the  case  of a
     successor  Collateral  Agent, upon the execution and filing or recording of
     such financing  statements,  or amendments thereto,  and such amendments or
     supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or notices, as may
     be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order
     to continue the  perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted
     by the  Collateral  Documents,  such  successor  Agent shall succeed to and
     become  vested  with all the rights,  powers,  discretion,  privileges  and
     duties of the retiring  Agent,  and the retiring  Agent shall be discharged
     from  its
<PAGE>

     duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. Upon the acceptance of any
     appointment as Agent  hereunder by a successor Agent as to less than all of
     the Facilities and, in the case of a successor  Collateral  Agent, upon the
     execution  and  filing  or  recording  of  such  financing  statements,  or
     amendments  thereto,  and such  amendments or supplements to the Mortgages,
     and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or
     as the Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of
     the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the  Collateral  Documents,
     such  successor  Agent  shall  succeed  to and become  vested  with all the
     rights, powers, discretion,  privileges and duties of the retiring Agent as
     to such  Facilities,  other than with respect to funds  transfers and other
     similar aspects of the  administration of Borrowings under such Facilities,
     issuances of Letters of Credit  (notwithstanding  any  resignation as Agent
     with respect to the Letter of Credit Facility) and payments by the Borrower
     in respect of such Facilities,  and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
     be discharged  from its duties and  obligations  under this Agreement as to
     such Facilities,  other than as aforesaid.  If within 45 days after written
     notice is given of the retiring  Agent's  resignation or removal under this
     Section 7.06 no successor  Agent shall have been  appointed  and shall have
     accepted such  appointment,  then on such 45th day (a) the retiring Agent's
     resignation or removal shall become effective, (b) the retiring Agent shall
     thereupon  be  discharged  from its duties and  obligations  under the Loan
     Documents and (c) the Required Lenders shall thereafter  perform all duties
     of the retiring Agent under the Loan Documents  until such time, if any, as
     the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above. After any
     retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent as to any of the
     Facilities shall have become effective,  the provisions of this Article VII
     shall inure to its  benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken
     by it while it was Agent as to such Facilities under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    GUARANTY

          SECTION 8.01. Guaranty; Limitation of Liability.

          (a)  Each  Guarantor,   jointly  and  severally,   hereby  absolutely,
     unconditionally  and irrevocably  guarantees the punctual payment when due,
     whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by
     acceleration,  demand or otherwise,  of all  Obligations of each other Loan
     Party now or hereafter  existing  under or in respect of the Loan Documents
     (including,    without   limitation,    any   extensions,    modifications,
     substitutions,  amendments  or  renewals  of any  or  all of the  foregoing
     Obligations),  whether  direct or  indirect,  absolute or  contingent,  and
     whether  for  principal,  interest  (including,  without  limitation,  Post
     Petition Interest), premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action,
     costs,  expenses  or  otherwise  (such  Obligations  being the  "Guaranteed
     Obligations"),  and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including,  without
     limitation,  fees and expenses of counsel)  incurred by the  Administrative
     Agent or any  other  Secured  Party in  enforcing  any  rights  under  this
     Guaranty or any other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing,  each  Guarantor's  liability  shall  extend to all amounts that
     constitute  part of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and  would be owed by any
     other  Loan  Party to any  Secured  Party  under or in  respect of the Loan
     Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due
     to the  existence of a  bankruptcy,  reorganization  or similar  proceeding
     involving such other Loan Party.
<PAGE>

          (b)  Each  Guarantor,  and by its  acceptance  of this  Guaranty,  the
     Administrative  Agent and each other Secured Party, hereby confirms that it
     is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations
     of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer
     or  conveyance  for  purposes of  Bankruptcy  Law,  the Uniform  Fraudulent
     Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign,
     federal  or state law to the extent  applicable  to this  Guaranty  and the
     Obligations  of each  Subsidiary  Guarantor  hereunder.  To effectuate  the
     foregoing  intention,  the Administrative  Agent, the other Secured Parties
     and the Guarantors  hereby  irrevocably  agree that the Obligations of each
     Subsidiary  Guarantor  under this  Guaranty at any time shall be limited to
     the maximum  amount as will  result in the  Obligations  of such  Guarantor
     under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

          (c) Each Guarantor hereby  unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that
     in the event any payment  shall be required to be made to any Secured Party
     under this Guaranty or any other guaranty,  such Guarantor will contribute,
     to the  maximum  extent  permitted  by law,  such  amounts  to  each  other
     Guarantor and each other  guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate  amount
     paid to the Secured Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents.

          SECTION 8.02.  Guaranty Absolute.  Each Guarantor  guarantees that the
     Guaranteed  Obligations  will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms
     of the Loan  Documents,  regardless of any law,  regulation or order now or
     hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction  affecting any of such terms or the
     rights of any Secured Party with respect  thereto.  The Obligations of each
     Guarantor  under or in  respect of this  Guaranty  are  independent  of the
     Guaranteed  Obligations  or any other  Obligations  of any other Loan Party
     under or in respect of the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions
     may be brought  and  prosecuted  against  each  Guarantor  to enforce  this
     Guaranty,  irrespective  of  whether  any  action is  brought  against  the
     Borrower or any other Loan Party or whether the  Borrower or any other Loan
     Party is  joined in any such  action  or  actions.  The  liability  of each
     Guarantor   under  this  Guaranty  shall  be   irrevocable,   absolute  and
     unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives
     any defenses it may now have or  hereafter  acquire in any way relating to,
     any or all of the following:

          (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any
     agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (b) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment  of, or in any
     other  term  of,  all or any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or any  other
     Obligations  of any  other  Loan  Party  under  or in  respect  of the Loan
     Documents,  or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
     from any Loan Document,  including, without limitation, any increase in the
     Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to
     any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

          (c) any taking, exchange,  release or non-perfection of any Collateral
     or any other collateral,  or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of,
     or consent to departure  from,  any other  guaranty,  for all or any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations;

          (d) any manner of application  of Collateral or any other  collateral,
     or proceeds thereof,  to all or any of the Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any
     manner  of  sale  or  other  disposition  of
<PAGE>

     any  Collateral or any other  collateral  for all or any of the  Guaranteed
     Obligations  or any  other  Obligations  of any Loan  Party  under the Loan
     Documents or any other assets of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

          (e)  any  change,   restructuring  or  termination  of  the  corporate
     structure or existence of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

          (f) any failure of any Secured Party to disclose to any Loan Party any
     information  relating to the business,  condition (financial or otherwise),
     operations,  performance,  properties  or prospects of any other Loan Party
     now or hereafter  known to such Secured Party (each  Guarantor  waiving any
     duty on the part of the Secured Parties to disclose such information);

          (g) the  failure  of any  other  Person to  execute  or  deliver  this
     Guaranty, any Guaranty Supplement or any other guaranty or agreement or the
     release or reduction of  liability of any  Guarantor or other  guarantor or
     surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or

          (h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute
     of  limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any  representation  by
     any Secured Party that might otherwise  constitute a defense  available to,
     or a discharge of, any Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety.

     This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,  as the case
     may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed  Obligations is
     rescinded or must  otherwise be returned by any Secured  Party or any other
     Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or
     any other Loan Party or otherwise,  all as though such payment had not been
     made.

          SECTION 8.03. Waivers and  Acknowledgments.  (a) Each Guarantor hereby
     unconditionally  and irrevocably  waives promptness,  diligence,  notice of
     acceptance,  presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance,
     default,  acceleration,  protest  or  dishonor  and any other  notice  with
     respect to any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and this  Guaranty  and any
     requirement that any Secured Party protect,  secure,  perfect or insure any
     Lien or any  property  subject  thereto  or  exhaust  any right or take any
     action against any Loan Party or any other Person or any Collateral.

          (b) Each Guarantor hereby  unconditionally  and irrevocably waives any
     right to revoke  this  Guaranty  and  acknowledges  that this  Guaranty  is
     continuing  in nature and applies to all  Guaranteed  Obligations,  whether
     existing now or in the future.

          (c) Each  Guarantor  hereby  unconditionally  and  irrevocably  waives
     (i) any  defense  arising by reason of any claim or  defense  based upon an
     election  of  remedies  by any  Secured  Party that in any manner  impairs,
     reduces,   releases  or  otherwise   adversely   affects  the  subrogation,
     reimbursement,  exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of such
     Guarantor or other rights of such  Guarantor to proceed  against any of the
     other  Loan  Parties,  any  other  guarantor  or any  other  Person  or any
     Collateral  and  (ii) any   defense  based  on  any  right  of  set-off  or
     counterclaim  against or in respect of the  Obligations  of such  Guarantor
     hereunder.
<PAGE>

          (d) Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Collateral Agent may, without
     notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without affecting the liability
     of such  Guarantor  under this  Guaranty,  foreclose  under any mortgage by
     nonjudicial  sale,  and each  Guarantor  hereby  waives any  defense to the
     recovery by the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties against such
     Guarantor of any deficiency  after such nonjudicial sale and any defense or
     benefits that may be afforded by applicable law.

          (e) Each Guarantor hereby  unconditionally  and irrevocably waives any
     duty on the part of any Secured  Party to disclose  to such  Guarantor  any
     matter,  fact or thing  relating to the business,  condition  (financial or
     otherwise), operations,  performance,  properties or prospects of any other
     Loan  Party  or any of its  Subsidiaries  now or  hereafter  known  by such
     Secured Party.

          (f)  Each  Guarantor  acknowledges  that it will  receive  substantial
     direct and indirect benefits from the financing  arrangements  contemplated
     by the Loan  Documents and that the waivers set forth in  Section 8.02  and
     this Section 8.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

          SECTION 8.04.  Subrogation.  Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
     irrevocably  agrees  not to  exercise  any  rights  that it may now have or
     hereafter  acquire against the Borrower,  any other Loan Party or any other
     insider  guarantor that arise from the existence,  payment,  performance or
     enforcement  of such  Guarantor's  Obligations  under or in respect of this
     Guaranty or any other Loan Document,  including,  without  limitation,  any
     right  of   subrogation,   reimbursement,   exoneration,   contribution  or
     indemnification  and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any
     Secured  Party  against  the  Borrower,  any other  Loan Party or any other
     insider guarantor or any Collateral,  whether or not such claim,  remedy or
     right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including,
     without  limitation,  the right to take or receive from the  Borrower,  any
     other Loan Party or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in
     cash or other  property  or by set-off or in any other  manner,  payment or
     security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of
     the  Guaranteed  Obligations  and all  other  amounts  payable  under  this
     Guaranty  shall have been paid in full in cash,  all  Letters of Credit and
     all Secured Hedge  Agreements shall have expired or been terminated and the
     Commitments  shall have expired or been terminated.  If any amount shall be
     paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at
     any time  prior to the  latest of  (a) the  payment  in full in cash of the
     Guaranteed  Obligations  and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty,
     (b) the   Termination  Date  and  (c) the  latest  date  of  expiration  or
     termination of all Letters of Credit and all Secured Hedge Agreements, such
     amount  shall be received  and held in trust for the benefit of the Secured
     Parties,  shall  be  segregated  from  other  property  and  funds  of such
     Guarantor  and shall  forthwith be paid or delivered to the  Administrative
     Agent in the same form as so received  (with any necessary  endorsement  or
     assignment)  to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed  Obligations  and
     all  other  amounts  payable  under  this  Guaranty,   whether  matured  or
     unmatured,  in accordance  with the terms of the Loan  Documents,  or to be
     held as Collateral for any Guaranteed  Obligations or other amounts payable
     under this Guaranty  thereafter  arising.  If (i) any  Guarantor shall make
     payment  to  any  Secured  Party  of  all or  any  part  of the  Guaranteed
     Obligations,  (ii) all of the Guaranteed  Obligations and all other amounts
     payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, (iii) the
     Termination Date shall have occurred and (iv) all Letters of Credit and all
     Secured Hedge Agreements shall have expired or been
<PAGE>

     terminated,  the Secured  Parties  will,  at such  Guarantor's  request and
     expense,  execute  and  deliver to such  Guarantor  appropriate  documents,
     without  recourse  and without  representation  or  warranty,  necessary to
     evidence the transfer by  subrogation  to such  Guarantor of an interest in
     the  Guaranteed  Obligations  resulting  from  such  payment  made  by such
     Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.

          SECTION 8.05. Guaranty Supplements. Upon the execution and delivery by
     any Person of a guaranty  supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit I
     hereto (each, a "Guaranty  Supplement"),  (a) such Person shall be referred
     to as an  "Additional  Guarantor"  and  shall  become  and  be a  Guarantor
     hereunder,  and each reference in this Guaranty to a "Guarantor" shall also
     mean and be a reference to such Additional Guarantor, and each reference in
     any other Loan Document to a "Subsidiary  Guarantor" shall also mean and be
     a reference to such Additional Guarantor,  and (b) each reference herein to
     " this Guaranty",  "hereunder",  "hereof" or words of like import referring
     to this  Guaranty,  and each  reference  in any other Loan  Document to the
     "Guaranty",  "thereunder",  "thereof" or words of like import  referring to
     this  Guaranty,  shall  mean  and  be  a  reference  to  this  Guaranty  as
     supplemented by such Guaranty Supplement.

          SECTION 8.06.  Subordination.  Each Guarantor hereby  subordinates any
     and all debts,  liabilities and other Obligations owed to such Guarantor by
     each other Loan Party (the  "Subordinated  Obligations")  to the Guaranteed
     Obligations to the extent and in the manner  hereinafter  set forth in this
     Section 8.06:

          (a)  Prohibited  Payments,  Etc.  Except during the  continuance  of a
     Default  (including the  commencement  and  continuation  of any proceeding
     under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party),  each Guarantor
     may  receive  regularly  scheduled  payments  from any other  Loan Party on
     account of the  Subordinated  Obligations.  After the occurrence and during
     the continuance of any Default (including the commencement and continuation
     of any  proceeding  under any  Bankruptcy  Law  relating  to any other Loan
     Party),  however, unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no Guarantor
     shall  demand,  accept or take any action to collect any payment on account
     of the Subordinated Obligations.

          (b) Prior Payment of Guaranteed  Obligations.  In any proceeding under
     any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party,  each Guarantor agrees
     that the Secured  Parties  shall be entitled to receive  payment in full in
     cash of all  Guaranteed  Obligations  (including  all interest and expenses
     accruing after the  commencement of a proceeding  under any Bankruptcy Law,
     whether or not  constituting  an allowed  claim in such  proceeding  ("Post
     Petition   Interest"))  before  such  Guarantor  receives  payment  of  any
     Subordinated Obligations.

          (c) Turn-Over.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of any
     Default  (including the  commencement  and  continuation  of any proceeding
     under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party),  each Guarantor
     shall,  if the  Administrative  Agent so  requests,  collect,  enforce  and
     receive payments on account of the Subordinated  Obligations as trustee for
     the Secured Parties and deliver such payments to the  Administrative  Agent
     on account  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  (including  all Post  Petition
     Interest), together with any necessary endorsements or other instruments of
     transfer,  but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of
     such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.

     during the  continuance  of any Default  (including  the  commencement  and
     continuation  of any  proceeding  under any  Bankruptcy Law relating to any
     other Loan Party),  the  Administrative  Agent is authorized  and empowered
     (but without any obligation to so do), in its  discretion,  (i) in the name
     of each Guarantor,  to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect
     of,  Subordinated  Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to
     the Guaranteed  Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest),

     submit claims in respect of,  Subordinated  Obligations  and (B) to pay any
     amounts  received  on such  obligations  to the  Administrative  Agent  for
     application  to the  Guaranteed  Obligations  (including  any and all  Post
     Petition Interest).

     continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the

     its  successors  and  assigns  and  (c) inure  to  the  benefit  of  and be
     enforceable by the Secured  Parties and their  successors,  transferees and
     assigns.  Without  limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately
     preceding sentence,  any Secured Party may assign or otherwise transfer all
     or  any  portion  of  its  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement
     (including,  without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments, the
     Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person,
     and such other Person shall  thereupon  become vested with all the benefits
     in respect  thereof  granted to such Secured Party herein or otherwise,  in
     each case as and to the extent provided in Section 9.07. No Guarantor shall
     have the  right to assign  its  rights  hereunder  or any  interest  herein
     without the prior written consent of the Secured Parties.

     addition  to the Lenders  required  above to take such  action,  affect the
     rights or obligations of the Swing Line Bank or of the Issuing Bank, as the
     case may be, under this Agreement;  and provided further that no amendment,
     waiver or  consent  shall,  unless  in  writing  and  signed by an Agent in
     addition  to the Lenders  required  above to take such  action,  affect the
     rights or duties of such  Agent  under  this  Agreement  or the other  Loan
     Documents.

     Lender  Party or any Agent to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any
     right  hereunder or under any Note or any
<PAGE>

     other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single

     exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies  herein
     provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.04.  Costs and Expenses.  (a) The Borrower  agrees to pay on
     demand  (i) all  reasonable  costs and expenses of each Agent in connection
     with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and
     amendment  of,  or  any  consent  or  waiver  under,   the  Loan  Documents
     (including, without limitation,  (A) all due diligence,  collateral review,

     or interests,  under the Loan Documents,  with respect to negotiations with
     any Loan  Party or with  other  creditors  of any Loan  Party or any of its
     Subsidiaries arising out of any Default or any events or circumstances that
     may give rise to a Default  and with  respect  to  presenting  claims in or
     otherwise  participating  in or monitoring  any  bankruptcy,  insolvency or
     other similar  proceeding  involving  creditors'  rights  generally and any
     proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all costs and expenses of each Agent
     and each  Lender  Party in  connection  with  the  enforcement  of the Loan
     Documents,  whether in any action,  suit or litigation,  or any bankruptcy,
     insolvency  or  other  similar  proceeding   affecting   creditors'  rights
     generally (including,  without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses
     of counsel for the Administrative  Agent and each Lender Party with respect
     thereto).

          (b) The  Borrower  agrees  to  indemnify,  defend  and  save  and hold
     harmless  each Agent,  each Lender Party and each of their  Affiliates  and
     their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each,
     an "Indemnified  Party") from and against, and shall pay on demand, any and
     all claims, damages, losses,  liabilities and expenses (including,  without
     limitation,  reasonable  fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred
     by or  asserted  or awarded  against any  Indemnified  Party,  in each case
     arising out of or in connection  with or by reason of  (including,  without
     limitation, in connection with any investigation,  litigation or proceeding
     or  preparation of a defense in connection  therewith) (i) the  Facilities,
     the actual or proposed  use of the  proceeds of the Advances or the Letters
     of  Credit,   the  Transaction   Documents  or  any  of  the   transactions
     contemplated  thereby or (ii) the  actual or alleged  presence of Hazardous
     Materials on any property of any Loan Party or any of its  Subsidiaries  or
     any  Environmental  Action  relating in any way to any Loan Party or any of
     its Subsidiaries,  except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability
     or  expense  is  found in a final,  non-appealable  judgment  by a court of
     competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross
     negligence  or  willful  misconduct.  In  the  case  of  an  investigation,
     litigation  or other  proceeding  to which the  indemnity  in this  Section
     9.04(b)  applies,  such  indemnity  shall be effective  whether or not such
     investigation,  litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party,  its
     directors,  shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified  Party or any other
     Person,  whether or not any Indemnified  Party is otherwise a party thereto
     and whether or not the Transaction is consummated. The Borrower also agrees
     not to assert any claim against any Agent, any Lender Party or any of their
     Affiliates,  or any of their  respective  officers,  directors,  employees,
     agents and  advisors,  on any theory of liability,  for special,  indirect,
     consequential or punitive  damages arising out of or otherwise  relating to
     the Facilities,  the actual or proposed use
<PAGE>

     of the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit,  the  Transaction
     Documents  or any  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Transaction
     Documents.

          (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion  of, any  Eurodollar
     Rate  Advance  is made by the  Borrower  to or for the  account of a Lender
     Party other than on the last day of the Interest  Period for such  Advance,
     as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09(b)(i)
     or  2.10(d),  acceleration  of  the  maturity  of  the  Notes  pursuant  to
     Section 6.01 or for any other reason,  or if the Borrower fails to make any
     payment or prepayment  of an Advance for which a notice of  prepayment  has
     been given or that is otherwise  required to be made,  whether  pursuant to
     Section 2.04, 2.06 or 6.01 or otherwise, the Borrower shall, upon demand by
     such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent),
     pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of such Lender  Party any
     amounts required to compensate such Lender Party for any additional losses,
     costs or expenses that it may reasonably  incur as a result of such payment
     or  Conversion  or such  failure  to pay or  prepay,  as the  case  may be,
     including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason
     of the  liquidation or  reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
     any Lender Party to fund or maintain such Advance.

          (d) If any Loan  Party  fails to pay when due any costs,  expenses  or
     other amounts  payable by it under any Loan  Document,  including,  without
     limitation,  fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities,  such amount may
     be paid on  behalf of such Loan  Party by the  Administrative  Agent or any
     Lender Party, in its sole discretion.

          (e) Without  prejudice to the  survival of any other  agreement of any
     Loan Party  hereunder or under any other Loan Document,  the agreements and
     obligations of the Borrower  contained in  Sections 2.10  and 2.12 and this
     Section 9.04  shall survive the payment in full of principal,  interest and
     all other  amounts  payable  hereunder  and  under  any of the  other  Loan
     Documents.

          SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
     continuance  of any Event of Default and  (b) the  making of the request or
     the granting of the consent  specified  by  Section 6.01  to authorize  the
     Administrative  Agent to declare the Notes due and payable  pursuant to the
     provisions  of  Section 6.01,  each Agent and each Lender Party and each of
     their respective  Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time
     to time, to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and otherwise
     apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
     or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such
     Agent,  such  Lender  Party or such  Affiliate  to or for the credit or the
     account  of the  Borrower  against  any and all of the  Obligations  of the
     Borrower  then due under the Loan  Documents.  Each  Agent and each  Lender
     Party  agrees  promptly to notify the  Borrower  after any such set-off and
     application;  provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall
     not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each
     Agent and each  Lender  Party and their  respective  Affiliates  under this
     Section are in addition to other  rights and remedies  (including,  without
     limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Agent, such Lender Party and
     their respective Affiliates may have.

          SECTION 9.06.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become  effective
     when it shall have been  executed  by the  Borrower  and each Agent and the
     Administrative  Agent shall have
<PAGE>

     been notified by each Initial  Lender Party that such Initial  Lender Party
     has  executed  it and  thereafter  shall be  binding  upon and inure to the
     benefit  of the  Borrower,  each  Agent  and each  Lender  Party  and their
     respective successors and assigns,  except that the Borrower shall not have
     the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
     prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

          SECTION  9.07.  Assignments  and  Participations.  (a) Each Lender may
     assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
     obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  all or a
     portion of its Commitment or Commitments,  the Advances owing to it and the
     Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment
     shall be of a  uniform,  and not a  varying,  percentage  of all rights and
     obligations  under and in respect of any or all Facilities,  (ii) except in
     the case of an  assignment  to a  Person  that,  immediately  prior to such
     assignment, was a Lender, an Affiliate of any Lender or an Approved Fund of
     any Lender or an  assignment  of all of a Lender's  rights and  obligations
     under  this  Agreement,  the  aggregate  amount  of the  Commitments  being
     assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such assignment  (determined
     as of the  date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  with  respect  to such
     assignment) shall in no event be less than 1,000,000 (or such lesser amount
     as shall be approved by the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default
     shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of  effectiveness of such
     assignment,  the  Borrower)  under each  Facility for which a Commitment is
     being  assigned,  (iii) each  such  assignment  shall  be  to  an  Eligible
     Assignee,  (iv) no such assignments  shall be permitted without the consent
     of the  Administrative  Agent  until the  Administrative  Agent  shall have
     notified the Lender Parties that  syndication of the Commitments  hereunder
     has been  completed  and (v) the  parties  to each  such  assignment  shall
     execute and deliver to the  Administrative  Agent,  for its  acceptance and
     recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance,  together with any
     Note or Notes subject to such  assignment and a processing and  recordation
     fee of $3,500.

          (b) Upon such execution,  delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
     after the  effective  date  specified in such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,
     (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
     rights and obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
     Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and obligations of a Lender or
     Issuing Bank, as the case may be,  hereunder and (ii) the Lender or Issuing
     Bank assignor  thereunder  shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
     hereunder  have  been  assigned  by it  pursuant  to  such  Assignment  and
     Acceptance,   relinquish   its  rights   (other   than  its  rights   under
     Sections 2.10,  2.12 and 9.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to
     an  event  arising  prior  to such  assignment)  and be  released  from its
     obligations  under this  Agreement  (and, in the case of an Assignment  and
     Acceptance  covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning  Lender's
     or Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement,  such Lender
     or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

          (c) By executing and  delivering an Assignment  and  Acceptance,  each
     Lender Party assignor  thereunder and each assignee  thereunder  confirm to
     and agree  with each  other and the other  parties  thereto  and  hereto as
     follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such
     assigning Lender Party makes no  representation  or warranty and assumes no
     responsibility   with   respect   to   any   statements,    warranties   or
     representations  made in or in  connection  with any Loan  Document  or the
     execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness, sufficiency or
     value of, or the  perfection  or priority of any lien or security  interest
<PAGE>

     created or purported to be created  under or in connection  with,  any Loan
     Document or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant  thereto;
     (ii) such  assigning Lender Party makes no  representation  or warranty and
     assumes no  responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition of any
     Loan Party or the performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of its
     obligations  under any Loan  Document or any other  instrument  or document
     furnished  pursuant  thereto;  (iii) such  assignee  confirms  that  it has
     received a copy of this  Agreement,  together  with copies of the financial
     statements  referred  to in  Section 4.01  and  such  other  documents  and
     information as it has deemed  appropriate  to make its own credit  analysis
     and  decision  to enter  into such  Assignment  and  Acceptance;  (iv) such
     assignee  will,  independently  and without  reliance upon any Agent,  such
     assigning  Lender  Party  or any  other  Lender  Party  and  based  on such
     documents  and  information  as it  shall  deem  appropriate  at the  time,
     continue to make its own credit  decisions  in taking or not taking  action
     under this  Agreement;  (v) such  assignee  confirms that it is an Eligible
     Assignee;  (vi) such  assignee  appoints and authorizes  each Agent to take
     such  action  as  agent on its  behalf  and to  exercise  such  powers  and
     discretion  under the Loan  Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the
     terms hereof and thereof,  together with such powers and  discretion as are
     reasonably  incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
     perform in accordance with their terms all of the  obligations  that by the
     terms of this  Agreement  are required to be performed by it as a Lender or
     Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

          (d) The  Administrative  Agent , acting for this purpose (but only for
     this purpose) as the agent of the Borrower,  shall  maintain at its address
     referred  to in  Section 9.02  a copy of  each  Assignment  and  Acceptance
     delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the  recordation  of the
     names and  addresses of the Lender  Parties and the  Commitment  under each
     Facility of, and principal amount of the Advances owing under each Facility
     to, each Lender  Party from time to time (the  "Register").  The entries in
     the  Register  shall be  conclusive  and binding for all  purposes,  absent
     manifest error,  and the Borrower,  the Agents and the Lender Parties shall
     treat each Person  whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender Party
     hereunder  for all  purposes  of this  Agreement.  The  Register  shall  be
     available  for  inspection by the Borrower or any Agent or any Lender Party
     at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  executed by an
     assigning  Lender  Party and an assignee,  together  with any Note or Notes
     subject  to  such  assignment,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall,  if such
     Assignment and Acceptance  has been completed and is in  substantially  the
     form of  Exhibit C  hereto,  (i) accept  such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,
     (ii) record  the  information   contained   therein  in  the  Register  and
     (iii) give  prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and each other Agent.  In
     the case of any assignment by a Lender, within five Business Days after its
     receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and
     deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or
     Notes a new Note to the order of such Eligible  Assignee in an amount equal
     to the  Commitment  assumed  by it under  each  Facility  pursuant  to such
     Assignment  and  Acceptance  and, if any  assigning  Lender has  retained a
     Commitment  hereunder under such Facility,  a new Note to the order of such
     assigning  Lender  in an  amount  equal to the  Commitment  retained  by it
     hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
     equal to the aggregate  principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes,
     shall be dated the effective  date of such  Assignment  and  Acceptance and
     shall otherwise be in substantially  the form of Exhibit A-1 or A-2 hereto,
     as the case may be.
<PAGE>

          (f) The  Issuing  Bank may assign to an Eligible  Assignee  all of its
     rights and  obligations  under the undrawn  portion of its Letter of Credit
     Commitment at any time; provided,  however, that each such assignment shall
     be to an Eligible  Assignee and the parties to each such  assignment  shall
     execute and deliver to the  Administrative  Agent,  for its  acceptance and
     recording in the Register,  an Assignment and  Acceptance,  together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

          (g) Each Lender Party may sell  participations  to one or more Persons
     (other  than any Loan  Party  or any of its  Affiliates)  in or to all or a
     portion of its  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  (including,
     without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing
     to it and the Note or Notes (if any) held by it); provided,  however,  that
     (i) such  Lender  Party's  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (including,
     without  limitation,  its Commitments)  shall remain  unchanged,  (ii) such
     Lender Party shall remain solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto
     for the  performance  of such  obligations,  (iii) such  Lender Party shall
     remain  the  holder of any such Note for all  purposes  of this  Agreement,
     (iv) the  Borrower,  the Agents and the other Lender Parties shall continue
     to deal solely and directly with such Lender Party in connection  with such
     Lender  Party's  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  and (v) no
     participant  under any such  participation  shall have any right to approve
     any  amendment  or waiver of any  provision  of any Loan  Document,  or any
     consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom,  except to the extent
     that such  amendment,  waiver or consent  would reduce the principal of, or
     interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable  hereunder,  in
     each case to the extent  subject to such  participation,  postpone any date
     fixed for any payment of  principal  of, or  interest  on, the Notes or any
     fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject
     to  such  participation,  or  release  all  or  substantially  all  of  the
     Collateral.

          (h) Any  Lender  Party  may,  in  connection  with any  assignment  or
     participation  or proposed  assignment  or  participation  pursuant to this
     Section 9.07,  disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
     or participant any information  relating to the Borrower  furnished to such
     Lender  Party by or on behalf of the  Borrower;  provided,  however,  that,
     prior to any such  disclosure,  the  assignee  or  participant  or proposed
     assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the  confidentiality of any
     Confidential Information received by it from such Lender Party.

          (i)  Notwithstanding  any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
     any Lender  Party may at any time create a security  interest in all or any
     portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,
     the  Advances  owing  to it and the Note or  Notes  held by it),  including
     without limitation, in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
     Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

          (j)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein,  any
     Lender  that is a fund that  invests  in bank  loans may  create a security
     interest in all or any portion of the Advances  owing to it and the Note or
     Notes  held by it to the  trustee  for  holders  of  obligations  owed,  or
     securities  issued,  by such  fund as  security  for  such  obligations  or
     securities, provided, that unless and until such trustee actually becomes a
     Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 9.07, (i) no
     such pledge shall release the pledging  Lender from any of its  obligations
     under the Loan  Documents  and (ii) such  trustee  shall not be entitled to
     exercise
<PAGE>

     any of the rights of a Lender  under the Loan  Documents  even  though such
     trustee may have  acquired  ownership  rights  with  respect to the pledged
     interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

          (k)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein,  any
     Lender Party (a "Granting  Lender") may grant to a special  purpose funding
     vehicle  identified  as such in writing  from time to time by the  Granting
     Lender to the  Administrative  Agent and the Borrower (an "SPC") the option
     to provide all or any part of any Advance that such  Granting  Lender would
     otherwise be obligated to make  pursuant to this  Agreement,  provided that
     (i) nothing  herein shall  constitute  a commitment  by any SPC to fund any
     Advance, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise
     fails to make all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be
     obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of
     an Advance by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting
     Lender  to the same  extent,  and as if,  such  Advance  were  made by such
     Granting  Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) no SPC shall be
     liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement
     for which a Lender Party would be liable,  (ii) no SPC shall be entitled to
     the  benefits  of  Sections  2.10 and 2.12 (or any  other  increased  costs
     protection  provision)  and (iii) the Granting Bank shall for all purposes,
     including,  without limitation,  the approval of any amendment or waiver of
     any  provision  of any Loan  Document,  remain the  Lender  Party of record
     hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees
     (which  agreement shall survive the  termination of this  Agreement)  that,
     prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of
     all outstanding  commercial  paper or other senior Debt of any SPC, it will
     not institute  against,  or join any other person in  instituting  against,
     such  SPC  any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,  insolvency,  or
     liquidation  proceeding  under the laws of the  United  States or any State
     thereof.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
     Agreement,  any SPC may (i) with  notice to, but without  prior consent of,
     the  Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent  and  with the  payment  of a
     processing  fee of $500,  assign all or any portion of its  interest in any
     Advance to the Granting Lender and  (ii) disclose  on a confidential  basis
     any  non-public  information  relating  to its  funding of  Advances to any
     rating  agency,  commercial  paper  dealer  or  provider  of any  surety or
     guarantee or credit or liquidity  enhancement to such SPC. This  subsection
     (k) may not be amended  without the prior written  consent of each Granting
     Lender,  all or any part of whose  Advances  are being funded by the SPC at
     the time of such amendment.

          SECTION  9.08.  Execution  in  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may  be
     executed in any number of counterparts  and by different  parties hereto in
     separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be
     an original and all of which taken  together  shall  constitute one and the
     same  agreement.  Delivery by  telecopier of an executed  counterpart  of a
     signature  page to this  Agreement  shall be  effective  as  delivery of an
     original executed counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.09. No Liability of the Issuing Bank.  The Borrower  assumes
     all risks of the acts or omissions of any  beneficiary or transferee of any
     Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit.  Neither
     the Issuing Bank nor any of its  officers or  directors  shall be liable or
     responsible  for:  (a) the  use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or
     any acts or  omissions  of any  beneficiary  or  transferee  in  connection
     therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of
     any endorsement  thereon,  even if such documents should prove to be in any
     or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by
     the Issuing
<PAGE>

     Bank against presentation of documents that do not strictly comply with the
     terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any
     reference or adequate  reference to the Letter of Credit;  or (d) any other
     circumstances  whatsoever  in making or failing to make  payment  under any
     Letter of Credit,  except that the Borrower  shall have a claim against the
     Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower,  to the
     extent  of any  direct,  but not  consequential,  damages  suffered  by the
     Borrower  that the Borrower  proves were caused by (i) the  Issuing  Bank's
     willful   misconduct  or  gross   negligence  as  determined  in  a  final,
     non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in determining
     whether  documents  presented  under any Letter of Credit  comply  with the
     terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) the Issuing Bank's willful failure to
     make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the  presentation  to it
     of  a  draft  and  certificates  strictly  complying  with  the  terms  and
     conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
     the foregoing,  the Issuing Bank may accept  documents that appear on their
     face to be in order,  without  responsibility  for  further  investigation,
     regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.

          SECTION 9.10. Confidentiality.  Neither any Agent nor any Lender Party
     shall  disclose  any  Confidential  Information  to any Person  without the
     consent of the  Borrower,  other than  (a) to  such  Agent's or such Lender
     Party's  Affiliates and their officers,  directors,  employees,  agents and
     advisors and to actual or prospective  Eligible Assignees and participants,
     and then only on a confidential  basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or
     regulation or judicial process,  (c) as requested or required by any state,
     Federal  or  foreign   authority  or  examiner   (including   the  National
     Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners  or any similar  organization  or
     quasi-regulatory authority) regulating such Lender Party, (d) to any rating
     agency when required by it,  provided that,  prior to any such  disclosure,
     such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the  confidentiality  of any
     Confidential  Information  relating to the Loan Parties received by it from
     such Lender  Party,  (e) in  connection  with the  exercise of any right or
     remedy under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or (f) to any direct
     or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual
     counterparty's   professional   advisor   (so  long  as  such   contractual
     counterparty or  professional  advisor agrees to be bound by the provisions
     of this Section 9.10).

          SECTION 9.11. Release of Collateral and Guarantees.  In the event that
     Parent or any Subsidiary sells,  transfers or otherwise  disposes of all or
     any portion of any of the Equity  Interests,  assets or  property  owned by
     Parent  or  such  Subsidiary  in  a  transaction  not  prohibited  by  this
     Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall promptly
     (and the Lenders hereby authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent and
     the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as
     may be reasonably requested by the Borrower to release any Liens created by
     any Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests,  assets or property,
     including the release and satisfaction of record of any mortgage or deed of
     trust granted in connection herewith,  and, in the case of a disposition of
     all or  substantially  all the Equity Interests or assets of any Subsidiary
     that is a Loan Party, to terminate such Subsidiary's  Obligations under the
     Guaranty  and each other Loan  Document.  In addition,  the  Administrative
     Agent and the  Collateral  Agent will take such  actions as are  reasonably
     requested  by the Borrower to  terminate  the Liens and security  interests
     created by the Loan  Documents when all the  Obligations  have been paid in
     full and all Letters of Credit and Commitments  have been  terminated.  The
     Borrower  agrees to pay all  out-of-pocket  expenses of the  Administrative
     Agent
<PAGE>

     and  the  Collateral  Agent  in  connection  with  releases  of  Liens  and
     Obligations under the Guaranty provided for in this Section.

          SECTION 9.12. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
     irrevocably and unconditionally  submits,  for itself and its property,  to
     the nonexclusive  jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court
     of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate
     court from any  thereof,  in any  action or  proceeding  arising  out of or
     relating to this  Agreement or any of the other Loan  Documents to which it
     is a party, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and each of
     the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and  unconditionally  agrees that all
     claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  may be heard  and
     determined  in any such New York  State  court  or, to the  fullest  extent
     permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees
     that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding  shall be conclusive
     and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the  judgment or in
     any other manner  provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement  shall affect
     any  right  that any  party  may  otherwise  have to bring  any  action  or
     proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in
     the courts of any jurisdiction.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
     to the fullest  extent it may legally and  effectively do so, any objection
     that it may now or  hereafter  have to the  laying  of venue  of any  suit,
     action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
     the other  Loan  Documents  to which it is a party in any New York State or
     Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
     fullest extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to
     the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

          SECTION 9.13.  Governing  Law.  This  Agreement and the Notes shall be
     governed by, and  construed in  accordance  with,  the laws of the State of
     New York.

          SECTION 9.14. Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each of the Borrower,  the Agents
     and the Lender Parties irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
     action,  proceeding or  counterclaim  (whether  based on contract,  tort or
     otherwise)  arising out of or relating  to any of the Loan  Documents,  the
     Advances,  the  Letters of Credit or the actions of any Agent or any Lender
     Party  in  the  negotiation,  administration,  performance  or  enforcement
     thereof.

          IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
     be executed by their respective  officers thereunto duly authorized,  as of
     the date first above written.
