                                   Page 1 of 7

<PAGE>

                To permit persons duly authorized by the department or agency to
                inspect any records, papers, documents, facilities, goods and
                services of the Contractor which are relevant to this contract
                or the mission and statutory authority of the department and
                agency, and/or interview any clients and employees of the
                Contractor to be assured of satisfactory performance of the
                terms and conditions of this contract. Following such inspection
                the department will deliver to the Contractor a list of its
                concerns with regard to the manner in which said goods or
                services are being provided. The Contractor will rectify all
                noted deficiencies provided by the department within the time
                set forth by the department or provide the department with a
                reasonable and acceptable justification for the Contractor's
                failure to correct the noted shortcomings. The department shall
                determine whether such failure is reasonable and acceptable. The
                Contractor's failure to correct or justify within a reasonable
                time as specified by the department may result in the agency
                taking any of the actions identified in the Suspension section,
                or the department and agency deeming the provider's failure to
                be a breach of contract.

G.      INDEMNIFICATION

        If the Contractor is a state or local governmental entity, pursuant to
        subsection 768.28 (18) Florida Statutes, the provisions of this section
        do not apply.

                To indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the department and
                agency and all of their officers, agents, and employees from any
                claim, loss, damage, cost, charge, or expense arising out of any
                acts, actions, neglect or omission by the Contractor, its
                agents, employees, or subcontractors during the performance of
                the contract, whether direct or indirect, and whether to any
                person or property to which the department, agency or said
                parties may be subject, except that neither Contractor nor any
                of its subcontractors will be liable under this section for
                damages arising out of injury or damage to persons or property
                directly caused or resulting from the sole negligence of the
                department, agency or any of their officers, agents, or
                employees.

        2.      Contractor's obligation to indemnify, defend, and pay for the
                defense or at the department's option, to participate and
                associate with the department or agency in the defense and trial
                of any claim and any related settlement negotiations, shall be
                triggered by the department's notice of claim for
                indemnification to Contractor. The Contractor's inability to
                evaluate liability or its evaluation of liability shall not
                excuse the Contractor's duty to defend and indemnify the
                department or agency, upon notice by the department. Notice
                shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt
                requested. Only an adjudication or judgment after the highest
                appeal is exhausted specifically finding the department or
                agency solely negligent shall excuse performance of this
                provision by the Contractor. The Contractor shall pay all costs
                and fees related to this obligation and its enforcement by the
                department. The department's failure to notify the Contractor of
                a claim shall not release the Contractor of the above duty to
                defend.

                It is the intent and understanding of the parties that the
                Contractor is not an agent of the department or agency for
                purposes of application of section 768.28. F.S., and is not
                entitled or subject to any of the benefits and limitations
                therein. Contractor expressly agrees to and does hereby waive
                any and all claims or entitlement to any and all application of
                section 768.28 F.S., Contractor may have or may hereafter
                acquire by reason of this agreement or by interpretation of this
                agreement and applicable law by any court of law equity, or by
                or through any other dispute resolution method or forum,
                regarding any all claims that may directly or indirectly arise
                from or otherwise involve Contractor's direct or indirect
                involvement, obligations, or benefits under this agreement. Not
                withstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing in this agreement
                shall serve as a waiver of sovereign immunity, or any other
                defense, by the department or agency. Neither the Contractor nor
                any of its subcontractors are employees of the department or
                agency and shall not hold themselves out as employees or agents
                of the department or agency without specific authorization from
                the department. It is the further intent and understanding of
                the parties that the department or agency does not control the
                employment practices of the Contractor and shall not be liable
                for any wage and hour, employment discrimination, or other labor
                and employment claims, which arise against the Contractor.

H.      INSURANCE

                To provide adequate liability insurance coverage on a
                comprehensive basis and to hold such liability insurance at all
                times during the existence of this contract. The Contractor
                accepts full responsibility for identifying and determining the
                type(s) and extent of liability insurance necessary to provide
                reasonable financial protections for the Contractor and the
                clients to be served under this contract. Upon the execution of
                this contract, the Contractor shall furnish the department
                written verification supporting both the determination and
                existence of such insurance coverage. A self-insurance program
                established and operating under the laws of the State of Florida
                may provide such coverage. The department reserves the right to
                require additional insurance where appropriate.

        2.      If the Contractor is a state agency or subdivision as defined by
                section 768.28. Florida Statutes, the Contractor shall furnish
                the department, upon request, written verification of liability
                protection in accordance with section 768.28, Florida Statutes.
                Nothing herein shall be construed to extend any party's
                liability beyond that provided in section 768.28, Florida
                Statutes. (See also indemnification paragraph above.)

        statewide toll-free telephone number (1-800-96ABUSE)

                this contract without prior written approval of the department
                and agency. No such approval by the department and agency of any
                assignment or subcontract shall be deemed in any event or in any
                manner to provide for the incurrence of any obligation of the
                department or agency in addition to the total dollar amount
                agreed upon in this contract. All such assignments or
                subcontracts shall be subject to the conditions of this contract
                (except Section I, Paragraph P.I., Section II, Paragraph B., and
                Section I, Paragraph W, unless the subcontractor is a political
                subdivision of the state) and to any conditions of approval that
                the department or agency shall deem necessary.

                agency in accordance with section 287.0585, Florida Statutes.
                Failure to pay within seven (7) working days will result in a

                amount due, per day from the expiration of the period allowed
                herein for payment. Such penalty shall be in addition to actual
                payments owed and shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the
                outstanding balance due.

        3.      That this contract and its Attachments I, II, III, IV, V, and VI
                as referenced are binding upon the Contractor, its successors,
                subcontractors, assignees and transferees.

O.      RETURN OF FUNDS

                To return to the agency any overpayments due to unearned funds
                or funds disallowed pursuant to the terms of this contract that
                were disbursed to the Contractor by the agency. The Contractor
                shall return any overpayment to the agency within forty (40)
                calendar days after either discovery by the Contractor, or
                notification by the agency, of the overpayment. In the event
                that the Contractor or its independent auditor discovers an
                overpayment has been made, the Contractor shall repay said
                overpayment within forty (40) calendar days without prior
                notification from the agency. In the event that the agency first
                discovers an overpayment has been made, the agency will notify
                the Contractor by letter of such a finding. Should repayment not
                be made in a timely manner, the agency will charge interest of
                one (1) percent per month compounded on the outstanding balance
                after forty (40) calendar days after the date of notification or
                discovery.

        2.      For universities located in the state of Florida, should
                repayment not be made within forty (40) calendar days after the
                date of notification, the agency will notify the State
                Comptroller's Office who will then enact a transfer of the
                amounts owed from the state university's account to the account
                of the Agency for Health Care Administration.

                1.      The contractor is responsible for the administration and
                        management of all contractor functions, including all
                        subcontracts, employees, agents and anyone acting for or

                2.      The contractor will not interpret general Medicaid
                        policy. When interpretations are required, the
                        contractor must submit written requests to the contract
                        manager. The contract manager will contact the
                        appropriate agencies in responding to the request.
                3.      If the contractor delegates administrative and
                        management functions to a third party administrator
                        (TPA), the TPA must be licensed to do business as a TPA
                        in Florida. Such delegation to a TPA does not relieve
                        the contractor of responsibility for the administration
                        and management required under this contract.
                4.      The relationship between management personnel and the
                        governing body must be set forth in writing, including
                        each person's authority, responsibilities and function.
                5.      The contractor must develop and maintain written
                        policies and procedures to implement the provisions of
                        the contract.
                6.      The contractor must agree to the responsibilities and to
                        the performance of all services as set forth in all
                        provisions of this contract and its attachments.

1.3     INSOLVENCY PROTECTION

        A.      The contractor must establish a restricted insolvency protection
                account with a federally guaranteed financial institution
                licensed to do business in Florida in accordance with Section
                1903(m)(1) of the Social Security Act (amended by Section 4706
                of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997), and Section 409.912(15)(a),
                Florida Statutes. The contractor must deposit into that account
                five percent of the capitation payments made by the agency each
                month until a maximum total of two percent of the annualized
                total current contract amount is reached. No interest may be
                withdrawn from this account until the minimum balance of 2% of
                the contract annual amount is reached. Withdrawals from the
                account may not cause the balance therein to fall below the 2%
                of annual contract amount minimum. This provision will remain in
                effect as long as the contractor continues to contract with the
                department and agency. The restricted insolvency protection
                account may be drawn upon with the authorized signatures of two
                persons designated by the contractor, one person designated by
                the agency, and one person designated by the department. The
                signature card must be resubmitted when a change in authorized
                personnel occurs. If the authorized persons remain the same, the
                contractor must submit an attestation to this effect annually.
                All such agreements or other signature cards must be approved in
                advance by the agency. Upon request, a

                sample form (Multiple Signature Verification Agreement) will be
                supplied by the department.
        B.      In the event that a determination is made by the agency, in
                consultation with the department, that the contractor is
                insolvent, as defined in the glossary, the agency may draw upon
                the amount solely with the two authorized signatures of
                representatives of the department and agency and funds may be
                disbursed to meet financial obligations incurred by the
                contractor under this contract. The contractor shall provide a
                statement of account balance within 15 calendar days of request
                by the agency.
        C.      If the contract is terminated, expired, or not continued, the
                account balance shall be released by the agency to the
                contractor upon receipt of proof of satisfaction of all
                outstanding obligations incurred under this contract.
        D.      In the event the contract is terminated or not renewed and the
                contractor is insolvent, the agency may draw upon the insolvency
                protection account to pay any outstanding debts the contractor
                owes the agency including, but not limited to, overpayments made
                to the contractor, and fines imposed under the contract or
                Section 641.52, Florida Statutes, for which a final order has
                been issued. In addition, if the contract is terminated or not
                renewed and the contractor is unable to pay all of its
                outstanding debts to health care providers, the department,
                agency and the contractor agree to the court appointment of an
                impartial receiver for the purpose of administering and
                distributing the funds contained in the insolvency protection
                account. Should a receiver be appointed, he must give
                outstanding debts owed to the agency priority over other claims.
        E.      Pursuant to Section 409.912(15)(b), Florida Statutes, the
                department, in consultation with the agency may waive the
                insolvency protection account requirement, in writing, when
                evidence of adequate insolvency insurance and reinsurance are on
                file with the agency which will protect enrollees in the event
                the contractor is unable to meet its obligations.

1.4     SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS

        A.      All new contractors, after initial contract execution but prior
                to initial member enrollment, must submit to the department, if
                a private entity, proof of working capital in the form of cash
                or liquid assets excluding revenues from Medicaid premium
                payments equal to at least the first three months of operating
                expenses or $200,000, whichever is greater. This provision shall
                not apply to contractors who have been providing services to
                members for a period exceeding three continuous months.
        B.      In accordance with Section 409.912(14), Florida Statutes, the
                contractor must maintain at all times in the form of cash,
                investments that mature in less than 180 calendar days allowable
                as admitted assets by the Department of Insurance, and
                restricted funds of deposits controlled by the agency (including
                the plan's insolvency protection account) or the Department of
                Insurance, a surplus amount equal to one and one half times the
                contractor's monthly Medicaid prepaid revenues. In the event
                that the contractor's surplus (as defined in the glossary) falls
                below an amount equal to one and one half times the contractor's
                monthly Medicaid prepaid revenues, the department will cease the
                contractor's enrollment authorizations until the required
                balance is achieved, or may terminate the contract.

1.5     BONDS

        A.      The contractor must secure and maintain during the life of the
                contract a blanket fidelity bond from a company doing business
                in the State of Florida on all personnel in its employment and
                its board of directors. The bond must be issued in the amount of
                at least $250,000 per occurrence. Said bond must protect the
                department and agency from any losses sustained through any
                fraudulent or dishonest act or acts committed by any employees
                of the provider and subcontractors, if any. The contractor must
                submit proof of coverage within 60 calendar days after execution
                of the contract and prior to the

                surety company must comply with the provisions of Chapter 624,
                Florida Statutes. The contractor must submit proof of the
                fidelity bond annually during the contract renewal period.

                maintain, during the life of the contract, a performance bond
                from a company doing business in the State of Florida. The bond
                must guarantee the contractor's performance and obligations in
                accordance with the terms, conditions and agreements in this
                contract and be issued in the amount of $500,000.

1.6     INSURANCE

        A.      The contractor must obtain and maintain, at all times, adequate
                insurance coverage including general liability insurance,
                professional liability and malpractice insurance, fire and
                property insurance, and director's omission and error insurance.
                All insurance coverage must comply with the provisions set forth
                in Section 4-191.069, Florida Administrative Code, except that
                the reporting, administrative, and approval requirements will be
                submitted to the department in addition to the Department of
                Insurance. All insurance policies must be written by insurers
                licensed to do business in the State of Florida and be in good
                standing with the Department of Insurance. The contractor must

                manager. Each certificate of insurance must provide for
                notification to the department in the event of termination of
                the policy.

                contract, worker's compensation insurance for all of its
                employees connected with the work under the contract. Such

        A.      Interest generated through investments made by the contractor of
                funds provided to the contractor pursuant to this contract will
                be the property of the contractor and will be used at the
                contractor's discretion.
        B.      The contractor will retain any savings realized under the
                contract after all bills, charges, and fines are paid.

1.8     THIRD PARTY RESOURCES

        A.      The contractor will be responsible for making every reasonable
                effort to determine the legal liability of third parties to pay
                for services rendered to enrollees under this contract. The
                contractor has the same rights to recovery of the full value of
                services as the agency. (See Section 409.910, Florida Statutes)
                The following standards govern recovery.
        B.      If the contractor has determined that third party liability
                exists for part or all of the services provided directly by the
                contractor to an enrollee, the contractor must make reasonable
                efforts to recover from third party liable sources the value of
                services rendered.
        C.      If the contractor has determined that third party liability
                exists for part or all of the services provided to an enrollee
                by a subcontractor or referral provider, and the third party is
                reasonably expected to make payment within 120 calendar days,
                the contractor may pay the subcontractor or referral provider
                only the amount, if any, by which the subcontractor's allowable
                claim exceeds the amount of the anticipated third party payment;
                or, the contractor may assume full responsibility for third
                party collections for service provided through the subcontractor
                or referral provider.

        D.      The contractor may not withhold payment for services provided to
                an enrollee if third party liability or the amount of liabilitys
                cannot be determined, or if payment shall not be available
                within a reasonable time, beyond 120 calendar days from the date
                of receipt.
        E.      When both the agency and the contractor have liens against the
                proceeds of a third party resource, the agency shall prorate the
                amount due to Medicaid to satisfy such liens under Section
                409.910, Florida Statutes, between the agency and the
                contractor. This prorated amount shall satisfy both liens in
                full.
        F.      The agency may, at its sole discretion, offer to provide third
                party recovery services to the contractor. If the contractor
                elects to authorize the agency to recover on its behalf, the
                contractor shall be required to provide the necessary data for
                recovery in the format prescribed by the agency. All recoveries,
                less the agency's cost to recover shall be income to the
                contractor. The cost to recover must be expressed as a
                percentage of recoveries and must be fixed at the time the
                contractor elects to authorize the agency to recover on its
                behalf.
        G.      All funds recovered from third parties shall be treated as
                income for the contractor.

1.9     OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURE

        A.      Federal and state laws require full disclosure of ownership,
                management and control of Medicaid HMOs, including other
                qualified providers. Disclosure must be made on forms prescribed
                by the agency for the areas of ownership and control interest
                (Form HCFACMS 1513), business transactions (42 CFR 455.105),
                public entity crimes (Section 287.133(3)(a), Florida Statutes),
                and debarment and suspension (52 Fed. Reg., pages 20360-20369,
                and Section 4707 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997). The forms
                are available through the department and are to be submitted to
                the department with the initial application and then resubmitted
                on an annual basis. The contractor must disclose any changes in
                management as soon as those occur. In addition, the contractor
                must submit to the department full disclosure of ownership and
                control of Medicaid HMOs at least 60 calendar days before any
                change in the contractor's ownership or control occurs.
        B.      The following definitions apply to ownership disclosure:
                1.      A person with an ownership interest or control interest
                        means a person or corporation that:
                        a.      Owns, indirectly or directly, 5 percent or more
                                of the contractor's capital or stock, or
                                receives 5 percent or more of its profits;
                        b.      Has an interest in any mortgage, deed of trust,
                                note, or other obligation secured in whole or in
                                part by the contractor or by its property or
                                assets and that interest is equal to or exceeds
                                5 percent of the total property or assets; or
                        c.      Is an officer or director of the contractor if
                                organized as a corporation, or is a partner in
                                the contractor if organized as a partnership.
                2.      The percentage of direct ownership or control is
                        calculated by multiplying the percent of interest that a
                        person owns by the percent of the contractor's assets
                        used to secure the obligation. Thus, if a person owns 10
                        percent of a note secured by 60 percent of the
                        contractor's assets, the person owns 6 percent of the
                        contractor.
                3.      The percent of indirect ownership or control is
                        calculated by multiplying the percentage of ownership in
                        each organization. Thus, if a person owns 10 percent of
                        the stock in a corporation that owns 80 percent of the
                        contractor's stock, the person owns 8 percent of the
                        contractor.
        C.      Changes in management are defined as any change in the
                management control of the contractor. Examples of such changes
                are those listed below or equivalent positions by another title.
                1.      Changes in the Board of Directors or Officers of the
                        contractor, Medical Director, Chief Executive Officer,
                        Administrator, and Chief Financial Officer;
                2.      Changes in the management of the contractor where the
                        contractor has decided to contract out the operation of
                        the contractor to a management corporation. The
                        contractor must disclose such changes in management
                        control and provide a copy of

                        the contract agreement to the contract manager for
                        approval at least 60 calendar days prior to the
                        management contract start date.
        D.      In accordance with Section 409.912(29), Florida Statutes, the
                contractor must annually conduct a background check with the
                Florida Department of Law Enforcement on all persons with five
                percent or more ownership interest in the contractor, or who
                have executive management responsibility for the managed care
                plan, or have the ability to exercise effective control of the
                contractor. The contractor must submit information to the
                department for such persons who have a record of illegal conduct
                according to the background check. The department will keep a
                record of all background checks to be available for department
                and agency review upon request.
                1.      In accordance with Section 409.907(8), Florida Statutes,
                        contractors with an initial contract beginning on or
                        after July 1, 1997, must submit, prior to execution of a
                        contract, complete sets of fingerprints of principals of
                        the contractor to the agency for the purpose of
                        conducting a criminal history record check.
                2.      Principals of the contractor are defined in Section
                        409.907(8)(a), Florida Statutes.
        E.      The contractor must submit to the department, within five
                working days, any information on any officer, director, agent,
                managing employee, or owner of stock or beneficial interest in
                excess of five percent of the contractor who has been found
                guilty of, regardless of adjudication, or who entered a plea of
                nolo contendere or guilty to, any of the offenses listed in
                Section 435.03, Florida Statutes.
        F.      In accordance with Section 409.912(8), Florida Statutes, the
                department and agency will not contract with an entity that has
                an officer, director, agent, managing employee, or owner of
                stock or beneficial interest in excess of five percent of the
                contractor, who has committed any of the above listed offenses.
                In order to avoid termination, the contractor must submit a
                corrective action plan, acceptable to the department, that
                ensures such person is divested of all interest and/or control
                and has no role in the operation and management of the
                contractor
        G.      The contract is subject to the provisions of Chapter 112,
                Florida Statutes. The contractor must disclose the name of any
                officer, director, or agent who is an employee of the State of
                Florida, or any of its agencies. Further, the contractor must
                disclose the name  of any state employee who owns, directly or
                indirectly, an interest of five percent or more in the officer's
                firm or any of its branches. The contractor covenants that it
                presently has no interest and shall not acquire any interest,
                direct or indirect, which would conflict in any manner or degree
                with the performance of the services hereunder. The contractor
                further covenants that in the performance of the contract no
                person having any such known interest shall be employed. No
                official or employee of the department or agency and no other
                public official of the State of Florida or the federal
                government who exercises any functions or responsibilities in
                the review or approval of the undertaking of carrying out the
                contract must, prior to completion of this contract, voluntarily
                acquire any personal interest, direct or indirect, in this
                contract or proposed contract.

1.10    SUBCONTRACTS

        The contractor is responsible for all work performed under this
        contract, but may, with the written approval of the department, enter
        into subcontracts for the performance of work required under this
        contract. All subcontracts and amendments executed by the contractor
        must meet the following requirements and all model provider subcontracts
        must be approved, in writing, by the department in advance of
        implementation. All subcontractors must be eligible for participation in
        the Medicaid program; however, the subcontractor is not required to
        participate in the Medicaid program as a provider. Subcontracts are
        required with all major providers of services.

        The contractor must not discriminate with respect to participation,
        reimbursement, or indemnification as to any provider who is acting
        within the scope of the provider's license, or certification under
        applicable state law, solely on the basis of such license, or
        certification, in

        accordance with Section 4704 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This
        paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a contractor from including
        providers only to the extent necessary to meet the needs of the
        contractor's enrollees or from establishing any measure designed to
        maintain quality and control costs consistent with the responsibilities
        of the organization. No subcontract, which the contractor enters into
        with respect to performance under the contract, shall in any way relieve
        the contractor of any responsibility for the performance of duties under
        this contract. The contractor must assure that all tasks related to the
        subcontract are performed in accordance with the terms of this contract.
        The contractor must identify, in its subcontracts, any aspect of service
        that may be further subcontracted by the subcontractor. All model and
        executed subcontracts and amendments used by the contractor under this
        contract must be in writing, signed, and dated by the contractor and the
        subcontractor and meet the following requirements:

        A.      IDENTIFICATION OF CONDITIONS AND METHOD OF PAYMENT:
                1.      The contractor agrees to make payment to all
                        subcontractors pursuant to Section 641.3155, Florida
                        Statutes. If third party liability exists, payment of
                        claims must be determined in accordance with Section
                        70.201, Third Party Resources.
                2.      Provide for prompt submission of information needed to
                        make payment.
                3.      Make full disclosure of the method and amount of
                        compensation or other consideration to be received from
                        the contractor. The provider must not charge for any
                        service provided to the recipient at a rate in excess of
                        the rates established by the contractor's subcontract
                        with the provider in accordance with Section
                        1128B(d)(l), Social Security Act (enacted by Section
                        4704 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997).
                4.      Require an adequate record system be maintained for
                        recording services, charges, dates and all other
                        commonly accepted information elements for services
                        rendered to recipients under the contract.
                5.      Physician incentive plans must comply with 42 CFR
                        417.479. The contractor shall make no specific payment
                        directly or indirectly under a physician incentive plan
                        to a physician or physician group an inducement to
                        reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished
                        to an individual enrollee. Incentive plans must not
                        contain provisions that provide incentives, monetary or
                        otherwise, for the withholding of medically necessary
                        care. The contractor must disclose information on
                        provider incentive plans listed in 42 CFR 417.479(h)(1)
                        and 417.479(1) at the times indicated in 42 CFR
                        417.479(d)-(g). All such arrangements must be submitted
                        to the department for approval, in writing, prior to
                        use. If any other type of withhold arrangement currently
                        exists, it must be omitted from all subcontracts.
                6.      Specify whether the contractor will assume full
                        responsibility for third party collections in accordance
                        with Section 70.201, Third Party Resources.
        B.      PROVISIONS FOR MONITORING AND INSPECTIONS:
                1.      Provide that the department, agency and DHHS may
                        evaluate through inspection or other means the quality,
                        appropriateness and timeliness of services performed.
                2.      Provide for inspections of any records pertinent to the
                        contract by the department, agency and DHHS.
                3.      Require that records be maintained for a period not less
                        than five years from the close of the contract and
                        retained further if the records are under review or
                        audit until the review or audit is complete. (Prior
                        approval for the disposition of records must be
                        requested and approved by the provider if the
                        subcontract is continuous.)
                4.      Provide for monitoring and oversight by the contractor
                        and the subcontractor to provide assurance that all
                        licensed medical professionals are credentialed in
                        accordance with the contractor's and the agency's
                        credentialing requirements as found in Section 20.5.1,
                        Credentialing and Re-credentialing Policies and
                        Procedures, if the contractor has delegated the
                        credentialing to a subcontractor.
                5.      Provide for monitoring of services rendered to enrollees
                        sponsored by the provider.
        C.      SPECIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS OF THE SUBCONTRACTOR:
                1.      Identify the population covered by the subcontract.

                2.      Specify the amount, duration and scope of services to be
                        provided by the subcontractor, including a requirement
                        that the subcontractor continue to provide services
                        through the term of the capitation period for which the
                        agency has paid the contractor.

                        contractor.
        D.      PROTECTIVE CLAUSES:
                1.      Require safeguarding of information about enrollees in

                        provisions.

                        subcontract termination including breach of subcontract
                        due to insolvency, that assures that enrollees, the
                        department, or agency may not be held liable for any
                        debts of the subcontractor and, in accordance with 42
                        CFR 447.15, that the recipient is not liable to the

                        liable as specified in Section 641.3154, Florida
                        Statutes.
                4.      Contain a clause indemnifying, defending and holding the
                        department, agency, and the contractor's enrollees
                        harmless from and against all claims, damages, causes of
                        action, costs or expense, including court costs and
                        reasonable attorney fees arising from the subcontract
                        agreement. This clause must survive the termination of
                        the subcontract, including breach due to insolvency. The
                        department may waive this requirement for itself, but
                        not the contractor's enrollees, for damages in excess of
                        the statutory cap on damages for public entities if the
                        subcontractor is a public health entity with statutory
                        immunity. All such waivers must be approved in writing
                        by the department.
                5.      Require that the subcontractor secure and maintain
                        during the life of the subcontract worker's compensation
                        insurance for all of its employees connected with the
                        work under this contract unless such employees are
                        covered by the protection afforded by the contractor.
                        Such insurance must comply with the Florida's Worker's
                        Compensation Law.
                6.      Pursuant to Section 641.315(9), Florida Statutes,
                        contain no provision that prohibits a physician from
                        providing inpatient services in a contracted hospital to
                        an enrollee if such services are determined by the
                        organization to be medically necessary and covered
                        services under the organization's contract with the
                        contract holder.
                7.      Contain no provision restricting the provider's ability
                        to communicate information to the provider's patient
                        regarding medical care or treatment options for the
                        patient when the provider deems knowledge of such
                        information by the patient to be in the best interest of
                        the health of the patient.
                8.      Pursuant to Section 641.315(10), contain no provision
                        requiring providers to contract for more than one HMO
                        product or otherwise be excluded.
                9.      Pursuant to Section 641.315(6), Florida Statutes,
                        contain no provision that in any way prohibits or
                        restricts the health care provider from entering into a
                        commercial contract with any other contractor.
                10.     Specify that if the subcontractor delegates or
                        subcontracts any functions of the contractor, that the
                        subcontract or delegation include all the requirements
                        of this section.
                11.     Make provisions for a waiver of those terms of the
                        subcontract that, as they pertain to Medicaid
                        recipients, are in conflict with the specifications of
                        this contract.
                12.     Specify procedures and criteria for extension,
                        renegotiation, and termination, and that the provider
                        must give 60 days' advance written notice to the
                        contractor, and the Department of Insurance before
                        canceling the contract with the contractor for any
                        reason. Nonpayment for goods or services rendered by the
                        provider to the

                        contractor is not a valid reason for avoiding the 60 day
                        advance notice of cancellation pursuant to Section
                        641.315(2)(a)2., Florida Statutes. A copy of the notice
                        must be filed simultaneously with the department.

        Pursuant to Section 641.315(2)(b), Florida Statutes, specify that the
        contractor will provide 60 days' advance written notice to the provider
        and the Department of Insurance before canceling, without cause, the
        contract with the provider, except in the case in which a patient's
        health is subject to imminent danger or a physician's ability to
        practice medicine is effectively impaired by an action by the Board of
        Medicine or other governmental agency, in which case notification must
        be provided to the agency immediately. A copy of the notice submitted to
        the Department of Insurance must be filed simultaneously with the
        agency.

        The department may waive this requirement and permit the contractor to
        enter into a letter of agreement with certain facilities, licensed under
        Chapter 400, Part II, Florida Statutes and enrolled in the Medicare and
        Medicaid programs, when it is determined by the department to be in the
        best interest of the enrollee(s) to do so.

1.11    INDEPENDENT PROVIDER

        It is expressly agreed that the contractor and any subcontractors and
        agents, officers, and employees of the contractor or any subcontractors,
        in the performance of this contract shall act in an independent capacity
        and not as officers and employees of the department, agency or the State
        of Florida. It is further expressly agreed that this contract shall not
        be construed as a partnership or joint venture between the contractor or
        any subcontractor and the department, agency or the State of Florida.

1.12    TERMINATION

        A.      In conjunction with Part III section B, titled Termination in
                the core contract, termination procedures are required. The
                party initiating the termination must render written notice of
                termination to the other parties to this agreement by certified
                mail, return receipt requested, or in person with proof of
                delivery, or by facsimile letter followed by certified mail,
                return receipt requested. The notice of termination must specify
                the nature of termination, the extent to which performance of
                work under the contract is terminated, and the date on which
                such termination shall become effective. In accordance with
                1932(e)(4), Social Security Act, the department and agency shall
                provide the contractor with an opportunity for a hearing prior
                to termination for cause.

        B.      Upon receipt of final notice of termination, on the date and to
                the extent specified in the notice of termination, the
                contractor must:
                1.      Stop work under the contract, but not before the
                        termination date.
                2.      Cease enrollment of new enrollees under the contract.
                3.      Assign to the State those subcontracts as directed by
                        the department's and agency's contracting officer
                        including all the rights, title and interest of the
                        contractor for performance of those subcontracts.
                4.      At least 30 calendar days prior to the termination
                        effective date, provide written notification to all
                        enrollees of the following information: the date on
                        which the contractor will no longer participate in the
                        State's Medicaid program; and instructions on contacting
                        the department's CARES office to obtain information on
                        their long-term care options.
                5.      Take such action as may be necessary, or as the
                        department and agency may direct, for the protection of
                        property related to the contract, which is in the
                        possession of the provider, and in which the department
                        and agency have or may acquire an interest.
                6.      Not accept its prepaid payment for any requests for
                        payment submitted after the contract ends. Any payments
                        due under the terms of the contract may be withheld

                        until the department receives from the contractor all
                        written and properly executed documents as required by
                        the written instructions of the department.
                7.      Continue to serve or arrange for provision of services
                        to the enrollees enrolled pursuant to the contract on a
                        fee-for-service basis up to 45 days from the
                        notification of termination date.
                8.      In the event the department has terminated this contract
                        in one or more counties of the state, complete the
                        performance of this contract in all other areas in which
                        the contractor has not been terminated.

1.13    STATE OWNERSHIP

        The department and agency will have the right to use, disclose, or
        duplicate, all information and data developed, derived, documented, or
        furnished by the contractor resulting from the contract. Nothing herein
        will entitle the department and agency to disclose to third parties data
        or information which would otherwise be protected from disclosure by
        state or federal law.

        DAMAGES FROM FEDERAL DISALLOWANCES

        In addition to any remedies available through the contract, in law or
        equity, the contractor must reimburse the agency for any federal
        disallowances or sanctions imposed on the department or agency as a
        result of the contractor's failure to abide by the terms of the
        contract.

1.15    OFFER OF GRATUITIES

        By signing this agreement, the contractor signifies that no recipient of
        or a delegate of Congress, nor any elected or appointed official or
        employee of the State of Florida, the General Accounting Office,
        Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and
        Medicaid Services, or any other federal department has or will benefit
        financially or materially from this procurement. The department may
        terminate the contract if it is determined that gratuities of any kind
        were offered to or received by any officials or employees from the
        offeror, his agent, or employees.

        ATTORNEYS' FEES

        In the event of a dispute, each party to the contract will be
        responsible for its own attorney's fees except as otherwise provided by
        law.

        VENUE OR COURT OF JURISDICTION

        For purposes of any legal action occurring as a result of or under the
        contract, between the contractor and the department or agency, the place
        of proper venue will be Leon County. The parties expressly agree that:
        A.      The appropriate circuit or county court in Leon County, Florida
                will have jurisdiction of all equitable matters.
        B.      The department will have the discretion to resolve all other
                matters by informal hearing.

                to the Division of Administrative Hearings for a formal hearing.

                department will determine the proper forum.

1.18    ASSIGNMENT

        A.      Except as provided below or with the prior written approval of
                the department, which approval will not be unreasonably
                withheld, the contract and the monies which may become due are
                not to be assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in any
                way by the contractor, including by way of an asset or stock
                purchase of the contractor and will not be subject to execution,
                attachment or similar process by the contractor.
        B.      Exceptions for HMOs licensed under Section 641, Florida
                Statutes, are as follows:
                1.      As provided by Section 409.912(17). Florida Statutes,
                        when a merger or acquisition of a contractor has been
                        approved by the Department of Insurance pursuant to
                        Section 628.4615, Florida Statutes, the department shall
                        approve the assignment or transfer of the appropriate
                        Medicaid HMO contract upon the request of the surviving
                        entity of the merger or acquisition if the contractor
                        and the surviving entity have been in good standing with
                        the department and agency for the most recent 12 month
                        period, unless the department determines that the
                        assignment or transfer would be detrimental to the
                        Medicaid recipients or the Medicaid program.
                2.      To be in good standing, a contractor must not have
                        failed accreditation or committed any material violation
                        of the requirements of Section 641.52, Florida Statutes,
                        and must meet the requirements in this contract.
                3.      For the purposes of this section, a merger or
                        acquisition means a change in controlling interest of a
                        contractor, including an asset or stock purchase.

1.19    FORCE MAJEURE

        The department and agency will not be liable for any excess cost to the
        contractor if the department's or agency's failure to perform the
        contract arises out of causes beyond the control and without the result
        of fault or negligence on the part of the department or agency. In all
        cases, the failure to perform must be beyond the control without the
        fault or negligence of the department or agency. The contractor will not
        be liable for performance of the duties and responsibilities of the
        contract when its ability to perform is prevented by causes beyond its
        control. These acts must occur without the fault or negligence of the
        contractor. These include destruction to the facilities due to
        hurricanes, fires, war, riots, and other similar acts. Annually by May
        31, the contractor must submit to the department for approval an
        emergency management plan specifying what actions the contractor must
        conduct to ensure the ongoing provisions of health services in a natural
        disaster or man-made emergency.

1.20    DISPUTES OF APPROPRIATE ENROLLMENTS

        Any disputes arising in and under this contract, including disputes
        relating to the appropriateness of enrollments authorized by CARES staff
        pursuant to section 2.1 of this contract, will be decided by the
        department in consultation with the agency. This provision excludes
        matters brought forth by enrollees. The department must reduce its
        decision to writing and serve a copy on the contractor. The decision of
        the department will be final and conclusive. This contract with numbered
        attachments represents the entire agreement between the contractor, the
        department, and the agency with respect to the subject matter in it and
        supersedes all other contracts between the parties when it is duly
        signed and authorized by the contractor, the department and the agency.
        Correspondence and memoranda of understanding do not constitute part of
        this contract. In the event of a conflict of language between the
        contract and any attachments to the contract, the provisions of the
        contract will govern. However, the department and agency reserve the
        right to clarify any contractual relationship in writing with the
        concurrence of the contractor and such clarification will govern.
        Pending final determination of any dispute, the contractor must proceed
        diligently with the performance of the contract and in accordance with
        the department's direction.

1.21    Misuse of Symbols, Emblems, or Names in Reference to Medicaid

        No person or contractor may use, in connection with any item
        constituting an advertisement, solicitation, circular, book, pamphlet or
        other communication, or a broadcast, telecast, or other production,
        alone or with other words, letters, symbols or emblems the words
        "Medicaid," or "Department of Elder Affairs," or "Agency for Health Care
        Administration," except as required in the core contract unless prior
        written approval is obtained from the department. Specific written
        authorization from the department is required to reproduce, reprint, or
        distribute any department or agency form, application, or publication,
        for a fee. State and local governments are exempt from this prohibition.
        A disclaimer that accompanies the inappropriate use of the program or
        the department or agency's terms does not provide a defense. Each piece
        of mail or information constitutes a violation.

1.22    NON-RENEWAL

        The contract will be renewed only upon mutual consent of the parties.
        Either party may decline to renew the contract for any reason. The
        parties agree there is no property interest under the contract.

1.23    REPORTING

        The contractor is responsible for complying with all the reporting
        requirements in accordance with the contract. The department will
        provide the contractor with the appropriate reporting formats,
        instructions, submission timetables, and technical assistance when
        required. The department reserves the right to modify the reporting
        requirements to which the contractor must adhere. Failure of the
        contractor to submit the required reports accurately and within the time
        frames specified, may result in the withholding of three (3) percent of
        the next monthly capitation payment by the agency pending receipt of the
        reports.

1.24    LEGAL ACTION NOTIFICATION

        The contractor must give the department by certified mail immediate
        written notification (no later than 30 calendar days after service of
        process) of any action or suit filed or of any claim made against the
        contractor by any subcontractor, vendor, or other party which results in
        litigation related to this contract for disputes or damages exceeding
        the amount of $50,000. In addition, the contractor must immediately
        advise the department of the insolvency of a subcontractor or of the
        filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against a subcontractor.

1.25    FISCAL INTERMEDIARY

        If the contractor utilizes a fiscal intermediary service organization as
        defined in Section 641.316, Florida Statutes, such organization must be
        licensed to do business as a fiscal intermediary service organization in
        the state of Florida. Such delegation does not relieve the contractor of
        responsibility for the administration and management required under this
        contract.

1.26    SANCTIONS

        A.      In accordance with Section 4707 of the Balanced Budget Act of
                1997, and Section 409.912(19), F.S, the following sanctions may
                be imposed against the contractor if it is determined that the
                contractor has violated any provision of this contract, or the
                applicable statutes or rules governing Medicaid HMOs:
                1.      Suspension of the contractor's enrollment.

        CARES staff will notify the contractor, the lead agency, and when
        appropriate, hospital discharge planning staff regarding the need for a
        transition care plan. CARES staff will forward, to each of these
        entities, any information collected during the clinical eligibility
        determination process related to the person's health status, functional

        current service needs are being met.

        By the first date of enrollment, the contractor must provide transition
        care services in collaboration with CARES staff, and be able to assume
        responsibility for meeting the enrollee's care needs. The contractor

                8.      Information regarding the enrollee's right to disenroll
                        at any time and instructions to initiate the

                        agent's monthly processing deadline, disenrollment will
                        be effective the first of the following month. If

3.6     DISENROLLMENT

        A.      Enrollees must be allowed to voluntarily disenroll at any time.
                If voluntary disenrollment is requested prior to the fiscal
                agent's monthly processing deadline, disenrollment will be
                effective the first of the following month. If voluntary
                disenrollment is requested after the fiscal agent's monthly
                processing deadline, disenrollment will not take place until the
                first of the month subsequent to the next month.
        B.      The contractor must ensure that it does not restrict the

                during business hours. This assistance must be available through
                a toll-free telephone number or face-to-face contact. The
                contractor's written disenrollment procedure must list the staff
                responsible for this type of assistance.
        E.      The contractor must keep a daily log of all verbal and written
                disenrollment requests and the disposition of such requests. The
                contractor must ensure that disenrollment request logs are
                maintained in an identifiable manner, involuntary disenrollment
                documents are maintained in an identifiable enrollee record, and

                notice and opportunity to do so.

                services in person where practical, but otherwise by telephone,
                for members whose primary language is foreign. Foreign language
                versions of disenrollment materials are required if, as provided
                annually by the agency, the population speaking a particular
                foreign (non-English) language in a county is greater than five
                (5) percent.
        G.      Involuntary disenrollments are limited to the following reasons:
                1.      Enrollee death.
                2.      Ineligibility for Medicaid.
                3.      Ineligibility for the project.

                5.      Fraudulent use of the enrollee's Medicaid ID card.
                6.      Non-cooperation, subject to department approval.
        H.      After providing at least one verbal and at least one written
                warning of the full implications of failure to follow a
                recommended plan of care, the contractor may submit an
                involuntary disenrollment request to the department for an
                enrollee who continues

                                                       Contract No. 2002-2003-02

                not to comply. The department may approve such a request
                provided that a written explanation of reason for disenrollment
                is given to the enrollee prior to the effective date and
                provided that the enrollee's actions are not related to the
                enrollee's medical or mental condition. Enrollees must be given
                a reasonable opportunity to comply with the plan of care
                subsequent to each verbal and written warning before
                disenrollment is made effective except in instances where the
                enrollee's actions threaten the health, safety, or well being of
                service providers or contractor's staff or representatives.
                Enrollees who are disenrolled through this section are not
                eligible for re-enrollment without the permission of the
                contractor.
        I.      The contractor may also submit an involuntary disenrollment
                request for an enrollee whose behavior is disruptive, unruly,
                abusive, or uncooperative to the extent that his or her
                enrollment with the contractor seriously impairs the
                contractor's ability to furnish services to either the enrollee
                or other enrollees. The contractor must provide at least one
                verbal and one written warning to the enrollee regarding the
                implications of his or her actions. A written explanation of the
                reason for disenrollment must be given to the enrollee prior to
                submitting the disenrollment request. The department may approve
                such requests provided the contractor has documented the actions
                described above and the enrollee's actions are not related to
                the enrollee's medical or mental condition. Enrollees who are
                disenrolled through this action are not eligible for
                re-enrollment without the permission of the contractor.
        J.      For enrollees who wish to disenroll to participate in the
                Medicaid or Medicare hospice program, the contractor must submit
                a disenrollment request to the department for the enrollee
                immediately upon obtaining notice that the enrollee has been or
                will be admitted. The disenrollment will be effective upon the
                date of admission to the hospice.
        K.      Disenrollment request forms, whether completed by the
                contractor, the enrollee, or the department, must contain the
                following information: name, address, telephone number, reason
                for disenrollment with brief explanation, a signature by the
                enrollee or designee (for voluntary requests submitted by the
                enrollee), date, signatures by the contractor's staff (for
                involuntary disenrollments submitted by the contractor), and an
                indication as to whether or not the enrollee wishes to file a
                grievance.
        L.      All disenrollments, including those subject to prior approval,
                must be completed through the submission of a disenrollment
                report to the Medicaid fiscal agent in the enrollment,
                disenrollment, and cancellation report for payment.
        M.      The contractor must provide disenrollment data via the
                disenrollment report on the first available transmission after
                the date of receipt of the disenrollment request. In no event
                will the contractor submit a disenrollment report with an
                effective date later than 49 calendar days after the
                contractor's receipt of a voluntary disenrollment request.

                co-insurance Medicaid guidelines or the rate negotiated with the
                provider.
        G.      All services delivered by the contractor to enrollees, either
                directly or through a subcontract, must be guided by the
                following service delivery principles:
                1.      Services must be individualized as a result of a
                        competent, comprehensive understanding of an enrollee's
                        multiple needs.
                2.      Services must be delivered in a timely fashion in the
                        least restrictive, cost-effective and appropriate
                        setting.
                3.      Long-term care services must be based upon an enrollee's
                        plan of care and include goals, objectives, and specific
                        treatment strategies.
                4.      Services must be coordinated to address comprehensive
                        needs and provide continuity of care.
                5.      Services must be delivered regardless of geographic
                        location within the service area, level of functioning,
                        cultural heritage, degree of illness of the enrollee.
                6.      The project's administration and service delivery system
                        must ensure the participation of the enrollee in care
                        planning and delivery, and, as appropriate, allow for
                        the participation of the family, significant others, and
                        caregivers.
                7.      The contractor shall provide interpreter services in
                        person where practical, but otherwise by telephone, for
                        applicants or enrollees whose primary language is
                        foreign. Foreign language versions of materials are
                        required if, as provided annually by the agency, the
                        population speaking a particular foreign (non-English)
                        language in a county is greater than five (5) percent.
                8.      Services must be delivered by qualified providers as
                        defined in sections 4.4 and 4.5. The contractor must
                        have a credentialing system approved by an accreditation
                        organization that has been approved by the agency
                        pursuant to Section 641.512, Florida Statutes. The
                        system must include procedures for credentialing
                        long-term care providers.
                9.      All facilities providing services to enrollees must be
                        accessible to persons with disabilities, be smoke free,
                        and have adequate space, supplies, good sanitation, and
                        fire and safety procedures.

4.2     LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES

        With the exception of nursing facility services, the long-term care
        services in this section are authorized under the Medicaid home and
        community-based waiver.
        A.      Adult Companion Services: Non-medical care, supervision and
                socialization provided to a functionally impaired adult.
                Companions assist or supervise the enrollee with tasks such as
                meal preparation or laundry and shopping, but do not perform
                these activities as discrete services. The provision of
                companion services does not entail hands-on nursing care. This
                service includes light housekeeping tasks incidental to the care
                and supervision of the enrollee.
        B.      Adult Day Health Services: Services provided pursuant to Chapter
                400, Part V, Florida Statutes. For example, services furnished
                in an outpatient setting, encompassing both the health and
                social services needed to ensure optimal functioning of an
                enrollee, including social services to help with personal and
                family problems, and planned group therapeutic activities. Adult
                day health services include nutritional meals. Meals are
                included as a part of this service when the patient is at the
                center during meal times. Adult day health care provides medical
                screening emphasizing prevention and continuity of care
                including routine blood pressure checks and diabetic maintenance
                checks. Physical, occupational and speech therapies indicated in
                the enrollee's plan of care are furnished as components of this
                service. Nursing services which include periodic evaluation,
                medical supervision and supervision of self-care services
                directed toward activities of daily living and personal hygiene
                are also a component of this service. The inclusion of physical,
                occupational and speech therapy services and nursing

                                                       Contract No. 2002-2003-02

                services as components of adult day health services does not
                require the contractor to contract with the adult day health
                provider to deliver these services when they are included in an
                enrollee's plan of care. The contractor may contract with the
                adult day health provider for the delivery of these services or
                the contractor may contract with other providers qualified to
                deliver these services pursuant to the terms of this contract.
        C.      Assisted Living Services: Personal care services, homemaker
                services, chore services, attendant care, companion services,
                medication oversight, and therapeutic social and recreational
                programming provided in a home-like environment in an assisted
                living facility licensed pursuant to Chapter 400 Part II,
                Florida Statutes, in conjunction with living in the facility.
                This service does not include the cost of room and board
                furnished in conjunction with residing in the facility. This
                service includes 24 hour on-site response staff to meet
                scheduled or unpredictable needs in a way that promotes maximum
                dignity and independence, and to provide supervision, safety and
                security. Individualized care is furnished to persons who reside
                in their own living units (which may include dual occupied units
                when both occupants consent to the arrangement) which may or may
                not include kitchenette and/or living rooms and which contain
                bedrooms and toilet facilities. The resident has a right to
                privacy. Living units may be locked at the discretion of the
                resident, except when a physician or mental health professional
                has certified in writing that the resident is sufficiently
                cognitively impaired as to be a danger to self or others if
                given the opportunity to lock the door. The facility must have a
                central dining room, living room or parlor, and common activity
                areas, which may also serve as living rooms or dining rooms. The
                resident retains the right to assume risk, tempered only by a
                person's ability to assume responsibility for that risk. Care
                must be furnished in a way that fosters the independence of each
                consumer to facilitate aging in place. Routines of care
                provision and service delivery must be consumer-driven to the
                maximum extent possible, and treat each person with dignity and
                respect. Assisted living services may also include: physical
                therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, medication
                administration, and periodic nursing evaluations. The contractor
                may arrange for other authorized service providers to deliver
                care to residents of assisted living facilities in the same
                manner as those services would be delivered to a person in their
                own home.
        D.      Case Management Services: Services which facilitate enrollees
                gaining access to other needed services regardless of the
                funding source for the services, and which contribute to the
                coordination and integration of care delivery. The contractor
                will provide this service directly.
        E.      Chore Services: Services needed to maintain the home as a clean,
                sanitary and safe living environment. This service includes
                heavy household chores such as washing floors, windows and
                walls, tacking down loose rugs and tiles, and moving heavy items
                of furniture in order to provide safe entry and exit.
        F.      Consumable Medical Supply Services: The provision of disposable
                supplies used by the enrollee and care giver, which are
                essential to adequately care for the needs of the enrollee.
                These supplies enable the enrollee to perform activities of
                daily living or stabilize or monitor a health condition.
                Consumable medical supplies include adult disposable diapers,
                tubes of ointment, cotton balls and alcohol for use with
                injections, medicated bandages, gauze and tape, colostomy and
                catheter supplies, and other consumable supplies. Not included
                are items covered under the Medicaid home health service,
                personal toiletries, and household items such as detergents,
                bleach, and paper towels, or prescription drugs.
        G.      Environmental Accessibility Adaptation Services: Physical
                adaptations to the home required by the enrollee's plan of care
                which are necessary to ensure the health, welfare and safety of
                the enrollee or which enable the enrollee to function with
                greater independence in the home and without which the enrollee
                would require institutionalization. Such adaptations may include
                the installation of ramps and grab-bars, widening of doorways,
                modification of bathroom facilities, or installation of
                specialized electric and plumbing systems to accommodate the
                medical equipment and supplies which are necessary for the
                welfare of the enrollee. Excluded are those

                                                       Contract No. 2002-2003-02

                adaptations or improvements to the home that are of general
                utility and are not of direct medical or remedial benefit to the
                enrollee, such as carpeting, roof repair, or central air
                conditioning. Adaptations which add to the total square footage
                of the home are not included in this benefit. All services must
                be provided in accordance with applicable state and local
                building codes.
        H.      Escort Services: Personal escort for enrollees to and from
                service providers. An escort may provide language interpretation
                for people who have hearing or speech impairments or who speak a
                language different from that of the provider. Escort providers
                assist enrollees in gaining access to services.
        I.      Family Training Services: Training and counseling services for
                the families of enrollees served under this contract. For
                purposes of this service, "family" is defined as the individuals
                who live with or provide care to a person served by the
                contractor and may include a parent, spouse, children,
                relatives, foster family, or in-laws. "Family" does not include
                persons who are employed to care for the enrollee. Training
                includes instruction and updates about treatment regimens and
                use of equipment specified in the plan of care to safely
                maintain the enrollee at home.
        J.      Financial Assessment/Risk Reduction Services: Assessment and
                guidance to the caregiver and enrollee with respect to financial
                activities. This service provides instruction for and/or actual
                performance of routine, necessary, monetary tasks for financial
                management such as budgeting and bill paying. In addition, this
                service also provides financial assessment to prevent
                exploitation by sorting through financial papers and insurance
                policies and organizing them in a usable manner. This service
                provides coaching and counseling to enrollees to avoid financial
                abuse, to maintain and balance accounts that directly relate to
                the enrollees living arrangement at home, or to lessen the risk
                of nursing home placement due to inappropriate money management.
        K.      Home Delivered Meals: Nutritionally sound meals to be delivered
                to the residence of an enrollee who has difficulty shopping for
                or preparing food without assistance. Each meal is designed to
                provide 1/3 of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Home
                delivered meals may be hot, cold, frozen, dried, canned or a
                combination of hot, cold, frozen, dried, canned with a
                satisfactory storage life.
        L.      Homemaker Services: General household activities (meal

                hands-on care, and guidance to caregivers and enrollees with
                respect to nutrition. This service teaches caregivers and
                enrollees to follow dietary specifications that are essential to
                the enrollee's health and physical functioning, to prepare and
                eat nutritionally appropriate meals and promote better health
                through improved nutrition. This service may include
                instructions on shopping for quality food and on food
                preparation.
        N.      Personal Care Services: Assistance with eating, bathing,
                dressing, personal hygiene, and other activities of daily
                living. This service includes assistance with preparation of
                meals, but does not include the cost of the meals themselves.
                This service may also include housekeeping chores such as bed
                making, dusting and vacuuming, which are incidental to the care
                furnished or which are essential to the health and welfare of
                the enrollee, rather than the enrollee's family.
        O.      Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS): The installation and
                service of an electronic device which enables enrollees at high
                risk of institutionalization to secure help in an emergency. The
                PERS is connected to the person's phone and programmed to signal
                a response center once a "help" button is activated. The
                enrollee may also wear a portable "help" button to allow for
                mobility. PERS services are generally limited to those enrollees
                who live alone or who are alone for significant parts of the day
                and who would otherwise require extensive supervision.
        P.      Respite Care Services: Services provided to enrollees unable to

                to ensure that services are coordinated to the maximum extent
                feasible. The case manager must actively pursue coordination
                with the enrollee's primary care physician and other care
                providers.

        D.      In addition, the contractor will be responsible for the
                following activities to facilitate care coordination:
                1.      The contractor must implement a systematic process for
                        generating or receiving referrals and, with the
                        enrollee's written consent, sharing clinical and
                        treatment plan information, including management of
                        medications.
                2.      The contractor must implement a systematic process for
                        obtaining consent from enrollees or their
                        representatives to share confidential medical and
                        treatment planning information with providers.
                3.      The contractor must implement a systematic process for
                        coordinating care with organizations which are not part
                        of the contractor's network of providers but are
                        otherwise important to the health and well-being of
                        enrollees.
                4.      For enrollees in an assisted living or nursing facility,
                        the contractor will ensure coordination with the
                        medical, nursing, or administrative staff designated by
                        the facility to ensure that the enrollees have timely
                        and appropriate access to the contractor's providers and
                        to coordinate care between those providers and the
                        facility's providers.

4.11    PLAN OF CARE

        A.      The contractor is required to develop an individualized written
                plan of care, in a format approved by the department, for every
                new enrollee within 10 calendar days of the effective date of
                enrollment.
        B.      Services included in the plan of care will be determined by the
                contractor in consultation with the enrollee and be necessary to
                address health and social service needs of the enrollee
                identified through an assessment.
        C.      The plan of care must be based on a comprehensive assessment of
                the enrollee's health status, physical and cognitive
                functioning, environment, social supports, and end-of-life
                decisions. The plan of care must clearly identify barriers to
                the enrollee and caregivers, if applicable. The case manager
                must discuss barriers and explore potential solutions with the
                enrollee, and caregivers when applicable. The plan of care must
                detail all interventions designed to address specific barriers
                to independent functioning. The plan may include services
                provided through the enrollee's own informal network or by
                volunteers from community social service agencies or other
                organizations such as churches and synagogues.
        D.      In developing the plan of care, the contractor must:
                1.      Assess the immediacy of the new enrollee's services
                        needs and include a description of the project
                        participant's condition (e.g., ADL and IADL limitations,
                        incontinence, cognitive impairment, arthritis, high
                        blood pressure), as identified through an appropriate
                        comprehensive assessment and a medical history review.
                2.      Identify any existing care plans and service providers
                        and assess the adequacy of current services.
                3.      Provide for continuous care to the new enrollee if the
                        enrollee is receiving active treatment prior to the
                        effective date of enrollment.
                4.      Ensure that the care plan contains, at a minimum,
                        information about the enrollee's medical condition, the
                        type of services to be furnished, the amount, frequency
                        and duration of each service, and the type of provider
                        to furnish each service.
                5.      Ensure that treatment interventions address identified
                        problems, needs, and conditions. In consultation with
                        the enrollee and, as appropriate, the enrollee's legal
                        guardian or caregiver, the plan of care must specify the
                        long-term care service interventions, and when such
                        services are the responsibility of the contractor, the
                        medical interventions for the enrollee.
                6.      Ensure that review of the care plan is performed through
                        face-to-face contact with the enrollee at least every
                        six (6) months to determine the appropriateness and
                        adequacy of services and to ensure that the services
                        furnished are consistent with the nature and severity of
                        the enrollee's needs.

                                                       Contract No. 2002-2003-02

                7.      Ensure that the care plan is reviewed sooner than the
                        minimum required time frame if in the opinion of the
                        medical professionals involved in the care of the
                        enrollee there is reason to believe significant changes
                        have occurred in the enrollee's condition or in the
                        services the enrollee receives, or an enrollee or an
                        enrollee's legal representative requests another review
                        due to the changes in the enrollee's physical or mental
                        condition.
                8.      The contractor will work to ensure the maintenance or
                        creation of an enrollee's informal network of caregivers
                        and services providers. Primary caregivers, family,
                        neighbors and other volunteers will be integrated into
                        an enrollee's plan of care when it is determined through
                        multi-disciplinary assessment and care planning that
                        these services would improve the enrollee's capability
                        to live safely in the home setting and are agreed to by
                        the enrollee.
                9.      The contractor will implement a systematic process for
                        determining whether enrollees have advance directives,
                        health care powers of attorney, or do not resuscitate
                        orders. This information will become part of the
                        enrollee's medical record and these orders and
                        preferences will be integrated into the care
                        coordination process.
        E.      A copy of the plan of care must be forwarded to the enrollee's
                primary care physician.
        F.      A copy of the plan of care must be forwarded to the department's
                CARES office within 30 days of development.
        G.      Revisions to the plan of care must be done in consultation with
                the enrollee, the caregiver, and when feasible the primary care
                physician. If the primary care physician is not under contract
                with the contractor to deliver services to the enrollee, an
                effort must be made by the case manager to obtain physicians
                input regarding care plan revisions. Changes in service
                provision resulting from a care plan review must be implemented
                within ten (10) calendar days of the review date.

4.12    OUT OF NETWORK USE OF NON-EMERGENCY SERVICES

        Unless otherwise specified in this document, when an enrollee uses
        non-emergency services available under the project from a
        non-subcontracted provider, the contractor is not liable for the cost of
        such utilization unless the contractor referred the enrollee to the
        non-subcontracted provider or authorized such out-of-network
        utilization. The contractor must provide timely approval or denial of
        authorization of out-of-network use through the assignment of a prior
        authorization number which refers to and documents the approval. A
        contractor may not require paper authorization as a condition of an
        enrollee receiving treatment if the contractor has an automated
        authorization system. Written follow-up documentation of the approval
        must be provided to the out-of-network provider within one business day
        from the request for approval. The enrollee is liable for the cost of
        such unauthorized use of contract-covered services from
        non-subcontracted providers.

        However, in accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and
        pursuant to 42 CFR 422.100(b)(1)(iv), the plan must also cover
        post-stabilization services without authorization, regardless of whether
        the enrollee obtains the service within or outside the plan's network,
        for the following situations:

                A.      Post stabilization care services that were pre-approved
                        by the plan; or were not pre-approved by the plan
                        because the plan did not respond to the treating
                        provider's request for pre-approval within one hour
                        after being requested to approve such care, or could not
                        be contacted for pre-approval.

                B.      Post stabilization services are services subsequent to
                        an emergency that a treating physician views as
                        medically necessary after an emergency medical condition
                        has been stabilized. These are not emergency services,
                        but are non-emergency services that the plan chooses not
                        to cover out-of-plan except in the circumstances
                        described above.

5.3     QUALITY ASSURANCE COMMITTEE

        The contractor must have a quality assurance committee that is either a
        separate mechanism for addressing the quality assurance concerns of
        eligible frail enrollees, or incorporated into an existing quality
        assurance committee.

        The quality assurance committee must:
        A.      Oversee quality of life indicators such as, but not limited to
                the degree of personal autonomy, provision of services and
                supports to assist people in exercising medical and social
                choices, self-direction of care and maximum use of natural
                support networks.

                providers.

5.4     QUALITY OF CARE STUDIES

        The contractor must conduct quality of care studies to monitor the
        quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of enrollee care. The
        studies must include quarterly reviews of long-term care records of
        enrollees who have received services during the previous quarter. Review
        elements include management of diagnosis, appropriateness and timeliness
        of care, comprehensiveness of and compliance with the plan of care, and
        evidence of special screening for, and monitoring of, high risk persons
        and conditions.

        In accordance with Section 409.912(24) Florida Statutes, the studies
        must:
        A.      Target specific conditions and health service delivery issues
                appropriate to enrollees for focused monitoring and evaluation.
        B.      Use clinical care standards or practice guidelines to
                objectively evaluate health services delivery issues and the
                care the contractor delivers or fails to deliver for acute and
                long-term care conditions.
        C.      Use quality indicators derived from the clinical care standards
                or practice guidelines to screen and monitor care and services
                delivered.
        The contractors selection of conditions and issues to study should be
        based on member profile data.

5.5     INDEPENDENT QUALITY REVIEW

        The agency shall provide for an independent review of all Medicaid
        services provided or arranged by the contractor. The review shall be
        performed at least once annually by an entity outside state government.
        If the independent review indicates that quality of care is not
        acceptable pursuant to contractual requirements, the department may
        restrict the contractor's enrollment until quality of care issues are
        resolved.

SECTION 6.      GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

        A.      The contractor must develop and implement grievance procedures,
                subject to department and agency written approval, prior to
                implementation. The contractor must refer all enrollees and
                providers on behalf of enrollees who are dissatisfied with the
                contractor, to the grievance coordinator for the appropriate
                follow-up and documentation in accordance with the contractor's
                approved grievance procedures.

                3.      Allow for the participation of a representative of the
                        Department of Elder Affairs.
                4.      Provide assurance that all enrollees who are
                        dissatisfied with the contractor are referred to the
                        grievance coordinator for the appropriate follow-up and
                        documentation and that someone with problem solving
                        authority on behalf of the contractor is included in the

                6.      Respond to a complaint from an enrollee within a
                        reasonable time after its submission. At the time of

                        file a written grievance at any time and that assistance
                        in preparing the written grievance will be provided by

                        provision where the contractor must offer to meet with
                        the enrollee during the formal grievance process at the
                        administrative offices of the contractor within the
                        service area or at a location within the service area
                        convenient to the enrollee.
                7.      If the contractor is unable to resolve the grievance to
                        the enrollee's satisfaction, the contractor must provide
                        a final decision letter to the enrollee that includes
                        the following:

                                In addition, for expedited grievances, the
                                contractor must provide the enrollee notice of
                                the right to appeal immediately upon request.
                        b.      A notice that the enrollee may request a review
                                of the contractor's decision concerning the

                                from the contractor. The contractor must also
                                inform the enrollee how to initiate such a
                                review, and must include the panel's address and

                                with Section 408.7056, Florida Statutes, the
                                Statewide Provider and Subscriber Assistance
                                Panel will not consider a grievance taken to
                                Medicaid fair hearing.
                        c.      A notice that the enrollee retains the right to
                                pursue a Medicaid fair hearing, as provided by

                8.      Require the participation of physician(s) in reviewing
                        medically related grievances.
                9.      Method for classification of the urgency of grievances
                        and for establishing time limits for an expedited review
                        within which such grievances must be resolved. In an
                        expedited review, all necessary information, including
                        the contractor's decision, must be transmitted between
                        the contractor and the enrollee, or the provider acting
                        on behalf of the enrollee, by telephone, facsimile, or
                        the most expeditious method available. In any case when
                        the expedited review process does not resolve a
                        difference of opinion between the contractor and the
                        enrollee or the provider acting on behalf of the
                        enrollee, the enrollee or the provider acting on behalf
                        of the enrollee may submit a written grievance to the
                        Statewide Provider and Subscriber Assistance Panel. The
                        contractor must not provide an expedited retrospective
                        review of an adverse determination. A request for an
                        expedited review may be submitted orally or in writing.
                        Unless it is submitted in writing, for purposes of the
                        grievance reporting requirements, the request must be
                        considered an appeal of a utilization review decision
                        and not a grievance.
                10.     Notify enrollees that they may voluntarily pursue
                        binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of the
                        contract if offered by the contractor, after completing
                        the grievance procedure and as an alternative to the
                        Statewide Provider and Subscriber Assistance Panel. Such
                        notice must include an explanation that the enrollee may
                        incur some costs.
                11.     Describe of the process through which a enrollee may, at
                        any time, contact the toll-free telephone hotline of
                        the agency, (888) 419-3456, to inform it of the
                        unresolved grievance.
                12.     State that the enrollee has the right to pursue a
                        Medicaid fair hearing as provided by Rule 65-2.042,
                        F.A.C., in addition to pursuing the contractor's
                        grievance procedure. It must also state that the
                        enrollee always has the right to appeal to the agency
                        and the Statewide Provider and Subscriber Assistance
                        Panel after receiving a final disposition of the
                        grievance through the organization's grievance process
                        with the following exception; a grievance taken to
                        Medicaid fair hearing will not be considered by the
                        Panel. In addition, the contractor must notify enrollees
                        of the right to a Medicaid fair hearing at orientation,
                        during care plan development, and at any time an action
                        is taken to reduce, suspend or terminate services, or to
                        deny or terminate participation of the service providers
                        within the contractor's network.
        D.      TIME LIMITATIONS
                1.      The contractor must notify enrollees that a grievance
                        must be submitted within one year after the date of
                        occurrence of the action initiating the grievance.
                2.      With the exception of urgent grievances, the
                        contractor's grievance procedures must have guidelines
                        in place to resolve a grievance within 60 days after
                        receipt of the grievance, or within a maximum of 90 days
                        if the grievance involves the collection of information
                        outside the service area. These time limitations can be
                        tolled if the contractor has notified the enrollee, in
                        writing, that additional information is required for
                        proper review of the grievance and that such time
                        limitations are tolled until such information is
                        provided. After the contractor receives the requested
                        information, the time allowed for completion of the
                        grievance process resumes.
                3.      For an expedited review, the contractor must make a
                        decision and notify the enrollee, or the provider acting
                        on behalf of the enrollee, as expeditiously as the
                        enrollee's medical condition requires, but in no event
                        more than 72 hours after receipt of the request for
                        review. If the expedited review is a concurrent review
                        determination (utilization review conducted during the
                        enrollee's course of treatment) the service must be
                        continued without liability to the enrollee until the
                        enrollee has been notified of the determination. The
                        contractor must provide written confirmation of its
                        decision concerning an expedited review within 2 working
                        days after providing notification of that decision, if
                        the initial notification was not in writing. The
                        contractor must provide reasonable access, not to exceed
                        24 hours after receiving a request for an expedited
                        review, to an

                        appropriate clinical peer who can perform the expedited
                        review. The clinical peer or peers must not have been
                        involved in the initial adverse determination.
                4.      In the case of an adverse determination the contractor
                        must make available, to the enrollee, a review of the
                        grievance by an internal review panel; such review must
                        be requested within 30 days after the contractor's
                        transmittal of the final determination notice of an
                        adverse determination. A majority of the panel must be
                        persons who previously were not involved in the initial
                        adverse determination. A person who previously was
                        involved in the adverse determination may appear before
                        the panel to present information or answer questions.
                        The panel must have the authority to bind the contractor
                        to the panel's decision. The contractor must ensure that
                        a majority of the persons reviewing a grievance
                        involving an adverse determination are providers who
                        have appropriate expertise. The contractor must issue a
                        copy of the written decision of the review panel to the
                        enrollee and to the provider, if any, who submits a
                        grievance on behalf of an enrollee. In cases where there
                        has been a denial of coverage of service, the reviewing
                        provider must not be a provider previously involved with
                        the adverse determination.
        E.      Both informal and formal steps must be available to resolve
                grievances. A grievance is not considered formal until it is
                written and signed by an enrollee or completed on such forms as
                prescribed and received by the contractor. A complaint is not
                considered a grievance until the complaint is written and
                received by the contractor.
        F.      Procedural steps must be clearly specified in the enrollee
                handbook for enrollees and the provider manual for providers,
                including the address, telephone number and office hours of the
                grievance coordinator.
        G.      The contractor must insure that appropriate foreign language
                versions of grievance materials are developed and available to
                enrollees and potential enrollees. These foreign language
                versions of materials are required if the population speaking a
                particular foreign (non-English) language in a county is greater

        required.

        A.      Level of Analysis: The following levels of analysis will be
                used, as indicated, for the required reports:
                1.      Individual Level - One report is required for each
                        enrollee, e.g., one grievance record for each grievance,
                        one record per hospital discharge.
                2.      Location Level - One report required for each nine-digit
                        Medicaid provider number the contractor has under

                        summarized over all plans with the seven-digit Medicaid
                        provider code (1234567). A location level report would
                        have one report for each nine-digit provider number

8.2     ENROLLMENT, DISENROLLMENT, AND CANCELLATION REPORT FOR PAYMENT

        A.      This report is to be submitted monthly to the Florida Medicaid
                fiscal agent. This report may only be submitted in a file of the
                structure defined below and transmitted asynchronously to the
                Medicaid fiscal agent using the communications protocol defined
                below. The contractor is required to submit each month the data
                shown in the table below for every person who is to be enrolled,
                disenrolled, or canceled during the reported monthly period: The
                transfer file will be a fixed record length ASCII file (80
                bytes) to be transferred to the Medicaid fiscal agent using a
                Hayes Compatible Modem of 9600-57600 BPS operating over the
                public phone network. The data will be transferred using the
                X-MODEM or Z-MODEM transfer protocol. Communications protocol
                will be 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, full duplex, echo
                off.
        B.      The fiscal agent is authorized to process the monthly enrollment
                input data as an electronic transaction in which payment is
                generated for each enrollee according to the established
                capitation rate. On a specified date each month the plan will
                receive the remittance invoice accompanied by a payment warrant.
                The amount of payment is determined by the number of enrollees
                enrolled in each capitation category and any adjustments that
                may apply.

                                        foreseeable future.

                                c.      The following gains and losses are

9.7     STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN FINANCIAL POSITION AND NET WORTH

        A.      This report reflects the concept of funds as working capital,
                rather than the more limited cash concept. Use brackets to show
                negative balances. Inclusion of statutory reserves as a
                component of working capital is dependent in each situation on
                the use of the reserve as defined by the regulatory authority.
                The applicable test is whether the reserve is available for use
                in current operations. This report shows funds generated and
                applied to operations. Sources and applications of funds
                indicate funds generated (or lost) from operations, as well as
                other sources and applications. Net worth indicates changes in
                components of net worth over the past year. Sources of funds
                used in operations including the following:

SECTION 10      PAYMENT

10.1    PAYMENT TO CONTRACTOR

        The funds provided in this contract are identified in CFDA #93.778. The
        agency, through the Medicaid fiscal agent, will make a fixed rate
        payment, not to exceed the amount set forth in Attachment IV, to the
        contractor on a monthly basis for the contractor's satisfactory
        performance of its duties and responsibilities as set forth in the
        contract. The capitation rate will have two components: 1) a payment for
        medical care and 2) a payment for long-term care services.

                             Attachment I- 54 of 55

<PAGE>

                                                       Contract No. 2002-2003-02

        CAPITATION RATES

        A.      The medical care payment component is developed using the
                Medicaid fee-for-service claims experience of Medicaid
                enrollees aged 65 or older and who were assessed by CARES staff
                to meet nursing home level of care.

        B.      The long-term care payment component is developed using the
                Social Services Estimating Conference figure for the statewide
                average cost of nursing home care less patient responsibility.

        C.      The capitation rate to be paid will be as indicated in
                Attachment IV and may be re-calculated at least annually prior
                to the beginning of each state fiscal year.

        D.      The capitation rate to be paid will not exceed that amount which
                would have been paid, on an aggregate basis, by Medicaid under
                fee-for-service for the same services to a demographically
                similar population of enrollees.

10.3    PAYMENT IN FULL

        Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor must accept
        the capitation payment received each month as payment in full for all
        services provided to enrollees covered under this contract and the
        administrative costs incurred by the contractor in providing or
        arranging for such services.

10.4    CAPITATION RATE ADJUSTMENTS

        The contractor and the agency acknowledge that the capitation rate paid
        under this contract as specified in Attachment IV of this contract, is
        subject to approval by the federal government.

        A.      Adjustments to funds previously paid and to be paid may be
                required. Funds previously paid will be adjusted when capitation
                rate revisions are the result of legislatively mandated changes
                in Medicaid services, when capitation rate calculations are
                determined to have been in error, or an error is made in
                enrolling an ineligible person. In such events, the contractor
                agrees to refund any overpayment and the agency agrees to pay
                any underpayment.

        B.      The agency agrees to reflect changes in the Medicaid
                fee-for-service program. The rate of payment and total dollar
                amount may be adjusted with a properly executed amendment when
                Medicaid fee-for-service expenditure changes have been
                established through the appropriations process and subsequently
                identified in the agency's operating budget. Legislatively
                mandated changes will take effect on the dates specified in the
                legislation.

        Payment Errors

        If after preparation and electronic submission, a contractor error is
        discovered either by the contractor or the agency, the contractor has
        ten (10) business days to correct the error and resubmit accurate
        reports and/or invoices. Failure to respond within the ten (10) business
        day period may result in a loss of any money due the contractor.

        including suspension and/or debarment.

3.      The recipient or vendor shall provide immediate written notice to the
        contract manager at any time the recipient or vendor learns that its

        assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.

5.      The recipient or vendor further agrees by submitting this certification
        that, it shall not knowingly enter into any subcontract with a person

        may rely upon a certification of a recipient/subrecipients that is not
        debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily exclude from
        contracting/subcontracting unless it knows that the certification is
        erroneous.

8.      If the recipient or vendor is an Area Agency on Aging (AAA), the AAA may

                         FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT

The administration of resources awarded by the Agency for Health Care
Administration to the recipient may be subject to audits and/or monitoring by
the Agency as described in this section.

MONITORING

In addition to reviews of audits conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-133
and Section 215.97, F.S., as revised (see "AUDITS" below), monitoring procedures
may include, but not be limited to, on-site visits by Agency staff, limited
scope audits as defined by OMB Circular A-133, as revised, and/or other
procedures. By entering into this agreement, the recipient agrees to comply and
cooperate with any monitoring procedures/processes deemed appropriate by the
Agency. In the event the Agency determines that a limited scope audit of the
recipient is appropriate, the recipient agrees to comply with any additional
instructions provided by the Agency to the recipient regarding such audit. The
recipient further agrees to comply and cooperate with any inspections, reviews,
investigations, or audits deemed necessary by the Comptroller or Auditor
General.

AUDITS

PART I: FEDERALLY FUNDED

This Attachment is applicable if the recipient is a State or local government or
a non-profit organization as defined in OMB Circular A-133, as revised.

        In the event that the recipient expends $300,000 or more in Federal
        awards in its fiscal year, the recipient must have a single or
        program-specific audit conducted in accordance with the provisions of
        OMB Circular A-133, as revised. PART VI of this agreement indicates
        Federal resources awarded through the Agency. In determining the Federal
        awards expended in its fiscal year, the recipient shall consider all
        sources of Federal awards, including Federal resources received from the
        Agency. The determination of amounts of Federal awards expended should
        be in accordance with the guidelines established by OMB Circular A-133,
        as revised. An audit of the recipient conducted by the Auditor General
        in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-133, as revised,
        will meet the requirements of this part.

2.      In connection with the audit requirements addressed in Part I, paragraph
        1., the recipient shall fulfill the requirements relative to auditee
        responsibilities as provided in Subpart C of OMB Circular A-133, as
        revised.

3.      If the recipient expends less than $300,000 in Federal awards in its
        fiscal year, an audit conducted in accordance with the provisions of OMB
        Circular A-133, as revised, is not required. In the event that the
        recipient expends less than $300,000 in Federal awards in its fiscal
        year and elects to have an audit conducted in accordance with the
        provisions of OMB Circular A-133, as revised, the cost of the audit must
        be paid from non-Federal resources (i.e., the cost of such an audit must
        be paid from recipient resources obtained from other than Federal
        entities).

4.      Information concerning this section can be found on the Federal Office
        of Management and Budget Web page at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
        index

PART II: STATE FUNDED

This part is applicable if the recipient is a nonstate entity as defined by
Section 215.97(2)(1), Florida Statutes.

        In the event that the recipient expends a total amount of State
        Financial Assistance (i.e., State financial assistance provided to the
        recipient to carry out a State project) equal to or in excess of
        $300,000 in any fiscal year of such recipient, the recipient must have a
        State single or project-specific audit for such fiscal year in
        accordance with Section 215.97, Florida Statutes; applicable rules of
        the Executive Office of the Governor and the Comptroller, and Chapters
        10.550 (local governmental entities) or 10.650 (nonprofit and for-profit
        organizations), Rules of the Auditor General. PART VI of this agreement
        indicates State Financial Assistance awarded through the Agency by this
        agreement. In determining the State Financial Assistance expended in its
        fiscal year, the recipient shall consider all sources of State Financial
        Assistance, including State Financial Assistance received from the
        Agency, other state agencies, and other nonstate entities. State
        Financial Assistance does not include Federal direct or pass-through
        awards and resources received by the nonstate entity for Federal program
        matching requirements.

                                                                   (Page 2 of 4)

2.      In connection with the audit requirements addressed in Part II,
        paragraph 1, the recipient shall ensure that the audit complies with the
        requirements of Section 215.97(7), Florida Statutes. This includes
        submission of a financial reporting package as defined by Section
        215.97(2)(d), Florida Statutes, and Chapters 10.550 (local governmental
        entities) or 10.650 (nonprofit and for-profit organizations), Rules of
        the Auditor General.

3.      If the recipient expends less than $300,000 in State Financial
        Assistance in its fiscal year, an audit conducted in accordance with the
        provisions of Section 215.97, Florida Statutes, is not required. In the
        event that the recipient expends less than $300,000 in State Financial
        Assistance in its fiscal year and elects to have an audit conducted in
        accordance with the provisions of Section 215.97, Florida Statutes, the
        cost of the audit must be paid from the nonstate entity's resources
        (i.e., the cost of such an audit must be paid from the recipient's
        resources obtained from other than State entities).

                                  CERTIFICATION

      REGARDING HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996
                                   COMPLIANCE

This certification is required for compliance with the requirements of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

The undersigned Provider certifies and agrees as to abide by the following:

                Protected Health Information. For purposes of this
                Certification, Protected Health Information shall have the same
                meaning as the term "protected health information" in 45 C.F.R.
                Section 164.501, limited to the information created or received
                by the Provider from or on behalf of the Agency.

        2.      Limits on Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information.
                The Provider shall not use or disclose Protected Health
                Information other than as permitted by this Contract or by
                federal and state law. The Provider will use appropriate
                safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of Protected Health
                Information for any purpose not in conformity with this Contract
                and federal and state law. The Provider will not divulge,
                disclose, or communicate in any manner any Protected Health
                Information to any third party without prior written consent
                from the Agency. The Provider will report to the Agency within
                two (2) business days of discovery any use or disclosure of
                Protected Health Information not provided for in this Contract
                of which the Provider is aware. A violation of this paragraph
                shall be a material violation of this Contract.

        3.      Use and Disclosure of Information for Management,
                Administration, and Legal Responsibilities. The Provider is
                permitted to use and disclose Protected Health Information
                received from the Agency for the proper management and
                administration of the Provider or to carry out the legal
                responsibilities of the Provider, in accordance with 45 C.F.R.
                164.504(e)(4). Such disclosure is only permissible where
                required by law, or where the Provider obtains reasonable
                assurances from the person to whom the Protected Health
                Information is disclosed that: (1) the Protected Health
                Information will be held confidentially, (2) the Protected
                Health Information will be used or further disclosed only as
                required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed
                to the person, and (3) the person notifies the Provider of any
                instance of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of
                the Protected Health Information has been breached.

        4.      Disclosure to Subcontractors or Agents. The Provider agrees to
                enter into a subcontract with any person, including a
                subcontractor or agent, to whom it provides Protected Health
                Information received from, or created or received by the

9.   Attachment I, Section 8.1.A.4 is hereby deleted.

10.  The format in which monthly enrollment and disenrollment information is
     reported to the Department is hereby revised. The contractor agrees to use
     the revised format beginning with the submission of enrollment and
     disenrollment information for the month of January 2003.

     Attachment I, Section 8.3 is hereby amended to read:

     ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT SUMMARY

     This report provides a uniform means of reporting each contractor's monthly
     enrollments and disenrollments. The report is required to track enrollment
     and assess the reasons for each disenrollment, and to ensure that
     disenrollments are in compliance with contract guidelines.

     This report must be provided as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in the format
     specified in Exhibit A of this contract. Enrollments and disenrollments
     shall be numbered, and information shall be listed in alphabetized
     ascending order by enrollee last name, then by enrollee first name.
     Information shall pertain only to enrollments or disenrollments that are
     effective for the month being reported. For example, the November 2002
     report of disenrollments would include information on an enrollee that
     expired on October 28, 2002. October 28, 2002 would be provided as the
     Disenrollment Reason Occurrence Date for that enrollee in the Enrollment
     and Disenrollment Summary report.

11.  The format in which encounter data is reported to the Department is
     hereby revised. The contractor agrees to use the revised format beginning
     with the submission of encounter data for the quarter January through March
     2003.

     Attachment I, Section 8.4 is hereby amended to read

     ENCOUNTER DATA

     The contractor shall provide encounter level service utilization data as
     specified in Exhibit B of this contract. The services reported represent
     the comprehensive array of services that might be necessary to maintain a
     member at home while avoiding nursing home placement, including acute and
     long-term care services.

     These reports must be provided as ASCII, fixed length text files, with two
     files, per enrollee, per month. There will be one file for long-term care
     services and one file for acute care services. For example, if an enrollee
     were enrolled for an entire quarter, you would have three separate records
     in each of two separate files that are submitted once for the entire
     quarter. These two files, the Long-Term Care Services file and the Acute
     Care Services file, must be submitted once every quarter to the Department.

     The contractor may resubmit files with more current data during the
     subsequent reporting quarter to replace the data previously submitted. If
     files are resubmitted, the previously submitted data will be discarded, and
     the more recent data will be utilized.

     Attachment I, Section 8.5 is hereby amended to read:

     GRIEVANCE REPORT

     This report provides a uniform means of reporting each contractor's
     quarterly grievances, and is needed in order to track the number of
     grievances, as well as the reason and disposition of grievances. Grievance
     reporting provides a method by which to assess the contractor's ability to
     manage formal grievances through its internal grievance process.

     The Grievance Report must be provided as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in
     the format specified in Exhibit C of this contract. The Grievance Report
     shall be submitted by the contractor to report all formal grievances or
     updates to previously reported grievances, or to report whether there have
     been no new grievances during the reporting quarter.

13.  The contractor agrees to submit a quarterly updated Provider Network
     Listing beginning with the reporting quarter January through March 2003.

     Attachment I, Section 8.6 is hereby added as follows:

     PROVIDER NETWORK LISTING

     This updated listing provides current information on the contractor's
     provider network to ensure that adequate resources are available to
     enrollees at all times.

     The Provider Network Listing may be provided electronically as a Microsoft
     Word or Excel file, or as a hard copy via facsimile or mail. The Provider
     Network Listing shall be updated to include information on providers who
     joined the contractor's provider network, or who were terminated from the
     contractor's provider network during the reporting quarter.

     If the contractor has not added or terminated a subcontract to its provider
     network within the reporting quarter, a statement to that effect shall be
     provided to the Department in lieu of an updated Provider Network Listing.

14.  EXHIBIT A, Enrollment/Disenrollment Summary, is hereby made a part of the
     contract.

15.  EXHIBIT B, Encounter Data Reporting Format, is hereby made a part of the
     contract.

16.  EXHIBIT C, Report of Grievances, is hereby made a part of the contract.

amendment has been signed by all parties, whichever is later.

with this amendment shall be and are hereby changed to conform to this

SERVICE UTILIZATION REPORTING

The plan shall provide recipient-specific service utilization date in the
electronic format as specified below. The services reported represent the
comprehensive array of services that might be necessary to maintain a member at
home while avoiding nursing home placement, including acute and long-term care
services.

These reports must be provided as ASCII, fixed length text files, with two
files, per recipient, per month. There will be one file for long-term care
services and one file for acute care services. For example, if a recipient were
enrolled for an entire quarter, you would have three separate records in each of
two separate files that are submitted once for the entire quarter. These two
files, the LTC Services file and the Acute Care Services file, must be submitted
once every quarter to your DOEA/AHCA contract manager. You will have up to three
months after the last month in a specific quarter to submit the quarterly
report.

If no units of service are provided in a category or if the category is not
applicable to you, fill that field with the specified number of spaces (using
the spacebar) that match that particular field length. Right justify all fields
unless noted otherwise. For amount paid, include the sum of Medicaid and
Medicare crossover claims (deductibles and co-pays for Medicare claims).* If you
have questions about the definitions of these services please reference the
appropriate Medicaid coverage and limitations handbook for Medicaid state plan
services. Note: Please do not use commas between fields and round currency to
the nearest dollar amount.
