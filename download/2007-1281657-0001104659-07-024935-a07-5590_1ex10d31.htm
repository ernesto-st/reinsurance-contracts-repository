Applicable Interest Rate for the Interest Period in which such prepayment
occurs is less than the Assumed Note Rate, Lender shall promptly refund to
Borrower, without interest, an amount equal to the difference between the
interest paid by Borrower on the prepaid amount for such Interest Period
calculated at the Assumed Note Rate and the amount of interest on the prepaid
amount for such Interest Period calculated at the actual Applicable Interest
Rate for the Loan.&#160; Alternatively, in the
event that it is determined that the actual Applicable Interest Rate for
applicable Interest Period is greater than the Assumed Note Rate, Borrower
shall promptly pay to Lender, without additional interest or other late charges
or penalties (and in no event later than the next Payment Date) an amount equal
to the difference between the interest paid by Borrower on the prepaid amount
for the Interest Period in which such prepayment occurs calculated at the
Assumed Note Rate and the amount of interest on the prepaid amount for such

intends to transfer the Note and the other Loan Documents to one or more
special purpose entities in one or more transactions (collectively, with their
respective successors, assigns and beneficiaries, the &#147;<u>Trust</u>&#148;) in
connection with the issuance of securities.&#160;
In connection with such transfer, it is intended that a participation
agreement will be executed and delivered pursuant to which (i) senior
participation interests will be created representing a portion of the principal
amount of the Note previously advanced, and (ii) junior participation interests
(the &#147;<u>Junior Participations</u>&#148;) representing both funded portions of the
Note and all future funding obligations under the Note.&#160; The Junior Participations will transferred to
third parties (in such capacity, the &#147;<u>Junior Holders</u>&#148;). The
documentation associated with the Note obligates Lender to make future advances
of funds to Borrower with respect to the Property (such obligation, the &#147;<u>Future
Funding Obligations</u>&#148;).&#160; Lender will
not transfer the Future Funding Obligations to the Trust, but instead to the
Junior Holders.&#160; By its execution and
delivery of this Agreement and its acceptance of the Loan on the date hereof in
accordance with the terms hereof, Borrower hereby acknowledges, confirms and
agrees that; (i) the Note will be transferred to the Trust; (ii) Junior
Participations will be transferred to the Junior Holders; (iii) from and after
the date of transfer to the Junior Holders, the Future Funding Obligations will
be solely the obligation of the applicable Junior Holders, on the same terms
and conditions specified in the Note and the related Loan Documents; and (iv)
Borrower will not have any right of offset or other claim against any Trust (or
its assigns or beneficiaries) as holder of the Note or any interest therein in
connection with the Future Funding Obligations or against any Junior Holder,
other than with respect to the Future Funding Obligations associated with its
Junior Participation.</font></h2>
