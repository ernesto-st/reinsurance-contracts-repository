The fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets is and will, immediately following the making of the
Loan, be greater than Borrower&#146;s probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its

Leases are in full force and effect and, to Borrower&#146;s actual knowledge and except as may be
disclosed in any tenant estoppel certificates delivered to Lender, there are no material defaults
thereunder by either party and there are no conditions that, with the passage of time or the giving

deposits) has been paid more than one (1)&nbsp;month in advance of its due date. To Borrower&#146;s actual
knowledge and except as may be disclosed in any tenant estoppel certificates delivered to Lender,
all work to be performed by Borrower under each Lease has been performed as required and has been
accepted by the applicable Tenant , and any payments, free rent, partial rent, rebate of rent or
other payments, credits, allowances or abatements required to be given by Borrower to any Tenant

(other than to Borrower), hypothecation or pledge of any Lease or of the Rents received therein
(other than sales, transfers, assignments, hypothecations or pledges which may have been made by
the Tenants under the Leases). To Borrower&#146;s actual knowledge and except as indicated on Schedule
I, no Tenant listed on Schedule&nbsp;I has assigned its Lease or sublet all or any portion of the
premises demised thereby, no such Tenant holds its leased premises under assignment or sublease,
nor does anyone except such Tenant and its employees occupy such leased premises. No Tenant under
any Lease has a right or option pursuant to such Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of
the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a part, other than rights of
first refusal or rights of first offer described in any Leases delivered to Lender prior to the

Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums
required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Sections&nbsp;5.1.2 and 6.1 hereof and under the Mortgage.
In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to

or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien

amounts due for Taxes, Other Charges and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Sections&nbsp;5.1.2 and 6.1
hereof, Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess
against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance
Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund after the Debt has been
