<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">         (b)   Non-Refundable Payment.  [Intentionally deleted]        (c)   No Financing Contingency.  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the acquisition       of the Property by Buyer is not conditioned upon Buyer obtaining financing for all or any        portion  of  the  Consideration,  and  Seller  shall  have  no  obligation  to  cooperate  in  or        accommodate  requests  of  Buyer  related  to  Buyer&#8217;s  financing.   Notwithstanding  the        foregoing sentence, if and to the extent Seller cooperates with Buyer or accommodates any        request  of  Buyer  related  to  its  financing,  Seller&#8217;s  cooperation  in  or  accommodation  of        Buyer&#8217;s requests relating to its financing does not create or imply that Buyer&#8217;s financing        or any component thereof is a Buyer Closing Condition, and Buyer expressly waives the        right  to  assert  any  such  condition.  In  addition,  and  without  limiting  the  foregoing,  no        cooperation or accommodation on the part of Seller with Buyer&#8217;s requests relating to its        financing, or any action taken with respect thereto, shall constitute a waiver by Seller of        the terms of this Agreement or a modification of the terms of this Agreement.     4.    Buyer&#8217;s  Due  Diligence.   As  more  fully  provided  below,  Seller  agrees  to  assist  and  cooperate with Buyer in obtaining access to the Property and certain documents relating thereto  for purposes of inspection and due diligence.         (a)   Physical  Inspection  of  the  Property.   At  any  time(s)  reasonably  requested  by        Buyer following the Effective Date and prior to Closing, Seller shall afford Buyer and its        authorized  representatives  reasonable  access  to  the  Property  for  purposes  of  satisfying        Buyer  with  respect  to  the  suitability  of  the  Property  for  Buyer&#8217;s  purposes,  the        representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained herein and the satisfaction of        any conditions precedent to the Closing; provided, however, that Buyer shall not disturb or        interfere with the rights of any Tenant. Buyer shall provide Seller with notice on a Business        Day not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to any such inspections, and Seller, at its        election,  shall  have  the  right  to have  a  representative  present  during  any  such        investigations.  Seller shall have the right at all times to have a representative of Seller        accompany any of Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents while such persons are on the Property.  Buyer        may conduct Tenant interviews, provided Buyer has given Seller notice on a Business Day        not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to any such interview, and provided further that       Seller shall have the right to be present at all such interviews.  Notices to Seller pursuant       to this Section 4(a) may be delivered orally (if made in person, and not via voicemail, to        Alan  Shapiro  at  650-581-7606),  or  by  email  (if  made  to  Alan  Shapiro  at        alan.shapiro@glenborough.com  and  no  &#8220;out  of  office&#8221;  response  or other response        indicating delivery failure or Mr. Shapiro&#8217;s unavailability is generated).        (b)   Physical Testing.  Buyer shall not conduct or allow any Physical Testing without        Seller&#8217;s prior written consent, which consent may be withheld at Seller&#8217;s sole and absolute        discretion.  Buyer shall provide Seller with notice not less than five (5) Business Days prior        to the commencement of any Physical Testing, and if approved by Seller, Seller shall have        the right to have its own consultant present for any such work.  Buyer acknowledges and        agrees that Seller&#8217;s review of Buyer&#8217;s work plan is solely for the purpose of protecting        Seller&#8217;s interests, and shall not be deemed to create any liability of any kind on the part of        Seller  in  connection  with  such  review  that,  for  example,  the  work  plan  is  adequate  or                                 Purchase and Sale Agreement                                    Page 2 of 36  963039.6  </FONT></DIV>

(c)   Damage; Indemnity.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,        any entry upon, inspection, or investigation of the Property by Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents,        whether performed before or after the Effective Date, shall be performed at the sole risk        and expense of Buyer, and Buyer shall be solely and absolutely responsible for the acts or       omissions  of  Buyer  and  any  of  Buyer&#8217;s  Agents.   Furthermore,  Buyer shall protect,       indemnify, defend and hold Seller, and its successors, assigns, and affiliates harmless from       and  against  any  and  all  losses,  damages  (whether  general,  consequential,  punitive  or       otherwise), liabilities, claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and legal or other expenses       (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs) (collectively, &#8220;Access       Claims&#8221;)  suffered  or  incurred  by  any  or  all  of  such  indemnified  Parties  to  the  extent       resulting from (i) any act or omission of Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents in connection with entry       upon the Property by Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents, or the activities, studies or investigations       conducted at, to or on the Property by Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents, or (ii) any breach on the       part of Buyer of its obligations under this Section 4.

Buyer&#8217;s        obligation to indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless shall not apply to matters to the        extent arising or resulting from (i) the mere discovery by Buyer of any pre-existing defects        in the Property (except to the extent Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents exacerbate any such pre-       existing condition or such discovery is made in violation of the terms of this Agreement        pertaining to Physical Testing); or (ii) the discovery by Buyer of any Hazardous Materials        within, on or adjacent to the Property that were not released or deposited by Buyer or any        of Buyer&#8217;s Agents (except to the extent that Buyer or Buyer&#8217;s Agents exacerbate the scope        or effect of, or cause additional or further release of, any such Hazardous Materials,  or        such discovery is made in violation of the terms of this Agreement pertaining to Physical        Testing).  Buyer&#8217;s obligations under this Section 4 shall survive the termination of this        Agreement or the Closing, as the case may be, notwithstanding any other provisions herein        to the contrary, and shall not be limited by the terms of Section 14(c).

Except  as  specifically  set  forth  herein,  Seller  makes  no        representations or warranties as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of any materials,        data or other information supplied to Buyer in connection with Buyer&#8217;s inspection of the        Property (e.g., that such materials are complete, accurate, or the final version thereof, or        that  all  such  materials  are  in  the  Seller&#8217;s  possession).   It  is  the  Parties&#8217;  express        understanding  and  agreement  that  such  materials  are  provided  only  for  Buyer&#8217;s        convenience in making its own examination and determination prior to the Approval Date,        as to whether or not it wishes to purchase the Property, and, in doing so, Buyer shall rely        exclusively on its own independent investigation and evaluation of every aspect of the        Property and, except as expressly set forth herein, not on any materials supplied by Seller.         Buyer expressly disclaims any intent to rely on any such materials provided to it by Seller        in  connection  with  its  own  inspections  and  agrees  that  it  shall rely solely on its own        independently  developed  or  verified  information.

No later than ten        (10) days prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall advise Seller what        exceptions to title, if any, will be accepted by Buyer.  Seller shall have three (3) Business        Days after receipt of Buyer&#8217;s objections to give to Buyer: (A) written notice that Seller will       remove such objectionable exceptions on or before the Closing Date; or (B) written notice        that Seller elects not to cause such exceptions to be removed.  Seller&#8217;s failure to give notice        to Buyer within the three (3) Business Day period shall be deemed to be Seller&#8217;s election        not to cause such exceptions to be removed.  If Seller gives Buyer notice or is otherwise        deemed to have elected to proceed under clause (B), Buyer shall have until the end of the        Due Diligence Period, to elect to proceed with the transaction or terminate this Agreement.         If Buyer fails to give Seller notice of its election on or before the expiration of such period,        Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement.  If Seller gives notice        pursuant to clause (A) and fails to remove any such objectionable exceptions from title        prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer is unwilling to take title subject thereto, Buyer shall        have  the  right  to  elect  to  terminate  this  Agreement  and  Section  14(a)  shall  apply.         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Buyer  shall  be  deemed  to  have  objected  to  any  lien       encumbering the Property that secures the payment of money, such as mechanics&#8217; liens,       materialmen&#8217;s  liens  and  judgment  liens,  and  the  liens  of  deeds of  trust  and  mortgages       (collectively,  &#8220;Monetary  Liens&#8221;),  unless  Buyer  otherwise notifies  Seller  in  writing.         Monetary  Liens  shall  not  include  non-delinquent  assessments  or bond  amounts        encumbering the Property and reflected in the tax bills for the Property, non-delinquent        property  taxes  or  assessments,  or  non-delinquent  dues,  costs  or  assessments  under        declarations, reciprocal easements, or other covenants, conditions or restrictions to which        the Property is subject.  Seller hereby agrees to remove at or before the Closing and shall        cause the Property to be delivered free and clear of, Monetary Liens caused by Seller,        subject in the case of the lien in favor of the Existing Lender, the satisfaction of the Buyer       Closing Condition and Seller Closing Condition premised on the Existing Lender&#8217;s consent       to the release of the Property from the lien.  Buyer agrees that &#8220;removal&#8221; of an exception       shall include the Title Company&#8217;s willingness to endorse over such exception or provide       affirmative assurance to Buyer of no loss or damage to Buyer from such exception.          (i)   New  Exceptions.   In  the  event  the  Title  Company  notifies  Buyer  of  any  New       Exceptions to title after the Approval Date, Buyer shall have five (5) Business Days in       which to notify Seller of its approval or disapproval of such New Exception.  Failure to       deliver notice of approval of such New Exception shall be deemed disapproval of the New       Exception.  If Buyer disapproves such New Exception, Seller shall notify Buyer within two       (2) Business Days thereafter whether or not Seller can or will cause the removal of such       New Exception.  Failure to deliver such notice by Seller shall be deemed Seller&#8217;s refusal       to cause the removal of such New Exception.  If Seller is unwilling or unable to cause the       removal of such New Exception, Buyer shall have the right within two (2) Business Days       thereafter in which to waive such objection to title and proceed to Closing, or terminate       this Agreement, in which case Section 14(a) shall apply.  Failure by Buyer to deliver notice        of  waiver  shall  be  deemed  Buyer's  objection  to  title  and  election  to  terminate  this        Agreement.  Buyer  agrees  that  &#8220;removal&#8221;  of  a  New  Exception  shall  include  the  Title        Company&#8217;s willingness to endorse over such exception or provide affirmative assurance to        Buyer of no loss or damage to Buyer from such New Exception.

If Buyer elects ALTA        extended coverage title insurance, with survey coverage, Buyer shall have the right, at its        cost, to update, modify, amend or re-certify the Survey as necessary in order for the Title        Company  to  delete  the  survey  exception  from  the  Title  Policy  or  to  otherwise  satisfy        Buyer&#8217;s objectives.  Seller will consent to the use and update of such Survey by Buyer, at        Buyer&#8217;s cost.  Buyer shall have the right to object to any matters shown in the Survey no        later than six (6) days prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period in accordance with        Section 4(h).

Buyer agrees that the assurances given in        such affidavit may be relied on solely by the Title Company in connection with the issuance        of  title  policies  to  Buyer  and  any  lender  to  Buyer,  and  does  not  constitute  or  contain        representations, warranties or statements on which Buyer or such lender may rely.  Without        limiting the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any lender to Buyer shall be an express or implied        third party beneficiary of such affidavit.  It shall be a condition to Buyer&#8217;s obligation to        close the Escrow that the Title Company not be unwilling or unable to deliver to Buyer as        of the Closing its irrevocable commitment to issue to Buyer its Title Policy consistent in        all material respects with the commitment, if any, made by the Title Company as of the        Approval Date, subject to New Exceptions approved by Buyer.  For the avoidance of doubt,        and without limiting the foregoing, if, as of the delivery of the Approval Notice, Buyer is        negotiating with the Title Company as to the terms, coverage or endorsements to the Title        Policy,  it  shall  not  be  a  condition  to  Buyer&#8217;s  obligation  to  close  Escrow  that  the  Title        Company agree to such requests by Buyer or provide the coverage or assurances sought by        Buyer.  If, prior to the Approval Date, Buyer fails to obtain a commitment from the Title        Company generally or as to any particular exception or term of the Title Policy sought by        Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed, as of the Approval Date, to have waived objections to such        matters (notwithstanding any further efforts to address such issues with the Title Company,        and notwithstanding any agreement by Seller to cooperate with Buyer or the Title Company        in addressing such matters) and approved all exceptions to title other than Monetary Liens       and subsequent New Exceptions.         (l)   Buyer&#8217;s Right to Terminate.  At any time up to the Approval Date, Buyer has the        unqualified right to terminate this Agreement and obtain a full refund of the Earnest Money                                 Purchase and Sale Agreement                                    Page 6 of 36  963039.6  </FONT></DIV>

If Seller has paid                    the Property Taxes payable by any such Tenant, but Seller has not been                    reimbursed  by  such  Tenant,  Buyer  shall  credit  Seller  at  Closing  for  the                    amount paid by Seller, and Buyer shall thereafter have the right to collect                    those Property Taxes directly from such Tenant after the Closing.                 (iii) Security Deposits.  Seller shall deliver to Buyer all prepaid rents, security              deposits, letters of credit and other collateral actually held by Seller or any of its              Affiliates under any of the Leases, to the extent not applied by Seller to amounts              owing by a Tenant as permitted by the Leases prior to the Closing Date.               (iv)  Utilities.  Seller shall pay all water, sewer and utility charges through the              date of Closing.         (d)   Post-Closing Adjustments.  After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall make        post-Closing adjustments in accordance with the following:                (i)   Non-delinquent  Rents.   If  either  Buyer  or  Seller  collects  any  non-             delinquent Rents or Additional Rents applicable to the month in which the Closing              occurred, such Rents or Additional Rents shall be prorated as of the Closing Date              and paid to the Party entitled thereto within ten (10) days after receipt.               (ii)  Delinquent Rents for month in which the Closing occurred.  If either              Buyer or Seller collects any Rents or Additional Rents that were delinquent as of              the Closing Date and that relate to the rental period in which the Closing occurred,              then  such  Rents  or  Additional  Rents  shall  be  applied  in  the  following order of              priority: first, to reimburse Buyer or Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket, third-             party collection costs actually incurred by Buyer or Seller in collecting such Rents              or Additional Rents (including the portion thereof relating to the period after the              Closing Date); second, to satisfy such Tenant&#8217;s Rent or Additional Rent obligations              relating to the period after the Closing Date; and third, to satisfy such delinquent              Rent or Additional Rent obligations relating to the period prior to the Closing Date.               Seller  shall  have  the  right  to  take  collection  measures  against  any  delinquent              Tenants  (including  litigation), however  Seller  shall  not  seek  any  remedy  which                                  Purchase and Sale Agreement                                    Page 12 of 36  963039.6  </FONT></DIV>

Buyer shall use commercially reasonable             efforts to collect such amounts due from any Tenant; provided that Buyer shall not             be required to interfere with any Tenant&#8217;s continued occupancy and full use of its             premises under such Tenant&#8217;s Lease, or Buyer&#8217;s rights to receive Rent or Additional             Rent with respect to any period beginning on the Closing Date.                (iii) Percentage Rents.  To the extent that Buyer receives any Percentage Rents             after the Closing Date that are applicable to the period of time before the Closing             Date (including any such amounts received after any cut-off date for prorated rents             set forth in this Section 7), Buyer shall render an accounting to Seller with respect              to  such  Percentage  Rents  and  such  Percentage  Rents  shall  be  applied  in  the              following  order  of  priority:  (i)  first  to  Buyer  for  the  period covered  by  such              Percentage Rents following the calendar month in which the Closing occurred until              the Tenant under its Lease is current with respect to all Percentage Rents applicable              to periods after the Closing Date, and all expenses reasonably incurred by Buyer              collecting such rents, (ii) then to Seller and Buyer for the calendar month in which              the Closing occurred with such rents and other similar payments being prorated in              the same manner as otherwise provided in this Section 7 at Closing and on the              Closing Statement, and (iii) then to Seller for the period prior to the month in which              the Closing occurred.  If Percentage Rents are based on other than a month-to-             month basis (e.g., on a quarterly or annual basis), Percentage Rents collected by              Buyer after the Closing Date and applicable to the period of time before the Closing              Date shall be prorated as of the Closing Date based on the number of days in such              period for which such Percentage Rents are paid.                  (iv)  Expenses.  With respect to any invoice received by Buyer or Seller after the              Closing Date for Expenses that relate to the period in which the Closing occurred              and for which a proration was not made at the Closing pursuant to the proration              statement delivered to Buyer by Seller prior to the Closing, the Party receiving such              invoice shall give the other Party written notice of such invoice, and the other Party              shall have thirty (30) days to review and approve the accuracy of any such invoice.               If the Parties agree that the invoice is accurate and should be  paid,  Seller  shall              compute Seller&#8217;s pro rata share, write a check for that amount in favor of the vendor,              and then send the invoice and check to Buyer, in which case Buyer agrees that it              will pay for its share and forward the invoice and the two payments to the vendor.               (v)   Payment  of  2018  Expenses  by  Tenants;  True  Up.   To  the  extent  that              Seller has actually collected any portion of Expenses from Tenants under the Leases              as Additional Rents for calendar year 2018, Seller may retain all such Additional              Rents in amounts not to exceed such Tenants&#8217; share of Expenses actually paid, as              determined by the 2018 Stub Reconciliation (defined below).  Within sixty (60)              days after the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a reconciliation              Expense  statement  for  the  period  from  and  after  January  1,  2018,  to  but  not              including the Closing Date (the &#8220;2018 Stub Reconciliation&#8221;).

If the 2018 Stub Reconciliation evidences that Seller              has over-collected Additional Rent from Tenants for such period and Buyer did not              receive a credit at Closing for the Expenses to which such Additional Rents applies,              Seller shall pay such over-collected amounts to Buyer within thirty (30) days after              delivery of the 2018 Stub Reconciliation, and Buyer shall thereafter be responsible              for  making  reimbursement  to  the  Tenants  or  applying  the  same  to  Expenses  in              accordance  with  the  Leases.

(vi)  Survival of Obligations.  The obligations of Seller and Buyer under the             Subsection  entitled  &#8220;Post-Closing Adjustments&#8221;  shall  survive  the  Closing  for  a              period of six (6) months from the Closing Date, at which point all such adjustments              shall be made in a final accounting and all prorations hereunder shall be deemed              final for all purposes; provided, however, the final true-up of 2018 Expenses shall              be based on the 2018 Stub Reconciliation.         (e)   Allocation of Closing Costs.  Closing costs shall be allocated as set forth below:               (i)   Escrow charges: 50% to Buyer and 50% to Seller.               (ii)  Recording fees for Deed: 100% to Buyer.

Seller&#8217;s Representations and Warranties.          (a)   General.   Seller  represents  and  warrants  to  Buyer  the  matters  set  forth  on       Addendum II,  which  is  incorporated  herein  by  this  reference  as though  fully  set  forth        herein.   Other  than  as  expressly  contained  in  this  Agreement  and  Addendum II,  Seller        makes no representations or warranties of any kind relating to the Property or its condition        or  fitness.   Buyer  is  entitled to  rely  on  Seller&#8217;s  representations  and  warranties        notwithstanding Buyer&#8217;s inspection and investigation of the Property, except to the extent        that  Buyer  has  Actual  Knowledge  on  or  before  the  Closing  Date  that  any  such        representation or warranty is inaccurate in any material respect, and such inaccuracy did        not result from a Seller R&amp;W Breach (as defined below).           (b)   Untrue When Given on Effective Date.  Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if,        prior to the Closing, Seller has Actual Knowledge that any representation or warranty of        Seller  was  inaccurate  in  any  material  respect  on  the  Effective Date  (a  &#8220;Seller  R&amp;W        Breach&#8221;), or was true when given on the Effective Date but became inaccurate in any        material  respect  after  the  Effective  Date  (a  &#8220;Seller  R&amp;W  Change&#8221;).  If, prior to the        Closing, Buyer has Actual Knowledge (whether from Seller or its own investigation) that        a Seller R&amp;W Breach has occurred and Seller is unable to cure such Seller R&amp;W Breach        within ten (10)  days after  notice  from  Buyer  of  such  R&amp;W  Breach, such  Seller R&amp;W        Breach shall be a default on the part of Seller, and Buyer, in its sole discretion, shall have        the right, as its sole and exclusive remedies, to (i) terminate this Agreement, upon which        termination the Earnest Money (plus interest earned thereon) shall be returned to Buyer,        and if such Seller R&amp;W Breach has resulted in a loss in excess of the Material Damage        Floor, Seller shall pay the Expense Reimbursement to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days        after  delivery  to  Seller  of  reasonable  evidence  of  the  loss  sustained  by  Buyer  and  a        statement of Buyer&#8217;s reimbursable expenses, in which case the Parties shall have no further        rights or obligations under this Agreement except for those rights and obligations which        expressly survive termination of this Agreement, or (ii) waive such Seller R&amp;W Breach        and proceed to Closing.           (c)   True  When  Given;  Subsequent  Change.   If,  prior  to  the  Closing,  Buyer  has        Actual  Knowledge  (whether  from  Seller  or  its  own  investigation)  that  a  Seller  R&amp;W        Change has occurred, such Seller R&amp;W Change was not caused by a material breach by        Seller of its covenants under this Agreement or by an affirmative, intentional act on the        part of Seller which caused such representation and warranty to become inaccurate in any                                  Purchase and Sale Agreement                                    Page 20 of 36  963039.6  </FONT></DIV>

If, however, such Seller R&amp;W Change was caused by a        material  breach  by  Seller  of  its  covenants  under  this  Agreement or by an affirmative,        intentional  act  on  the  part  of  Seller  which  caused  such  representation  and  warranty  to        become inaccurate in any material respect, such Seller R&amp;W Change shall constitute a        Seller R&amp;W Breach, and if Seller is unable to cure such Seller R&amp;W Breach within ten        (10) days after notice from Buyer of such Seller R&amp;W Breach, such Seller R&amp;W Breach        shall be a default on the part of Seller, and Buyer, in its sole discretion, shall have the right,        as its sole and exclusive remedies, to (i) terminate this Agreement, upon which termination        the Earnest Money (plus interest earned thereon) shall be returned to Buyer, and if such        Seller R&amp;W Breach has resulted in a loss in excess of the Material Damage Floor, Seller        shall  pay  the  Expense  Reimbursement  to  Buyer  within  ten  (10)  Business  Days  after        delivery to Seller of reasonable evidence of the loss sustained by Buyer and a statement of        Buyer&#8217;s reimbursable expenses, in which case the Parties shall have no further rights or        obligations under this Agreement except for those rights and obligations which expressly        survive termination of this Agreement, or (ii) waive such Seller R&amp;W Breach and proceed        to Closing.           (d)   Buyer Closes With Knowledge of Inaccuracy.  If, prior to the Closing, Buyer has        Actual  Knowledge  that  any  representation  or  warranty  of  Seller is  inaccurate  in  any        material respect and Buyer consummates the Closing, such representation or warranty shall        be deemed modified by Buyer&#8217;s Actual Knowledge. Seller shall be liable to Buyer for a        breach by Seller of any one or more of the representations and warranties of Seller made        herein, only if (i) the breach thereof is first discovered by Buyer subsequent to Closing, (ii)        the claim thereon is asserted by Buyer to Seller in writing on or before the date one hundred        eighty (180) days after Closing, and (iii) the amount of any such loss, cost, liability, damage        and expense suffered by Buyer (when aggregated with all other amounts for which Seller        may be liable in connection with breaches of its representations, warranties or covenants        under this Agreement) shall exceed the Material Damage Floor.

In no event shall the amount of any such loss, cost, liability,        damage  and  expense  for  which  Seller  shall  be  liable  under  this Section  10  (when        aggregated  with  all  other  damages  for  which  Seller  may  be  liable  in  connection  with        breaches of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement) exceed the        Material Damage Ceiling.     11.   Buyer&#8217;s Representations and Warranties.

This provision shall not limit        any  of  the  Buyer&#8217;s  repair  obligations  under  the  Leases.   If  there  is  a  Minor  Loss  and        insurance coverage as set forth above is not available, Buyer shall have the same rights as        if it was a Major Loss.          (c)   Major Loss.  In the event of a Major Loss, Buyer may, at its option to be exercised       by  written  notice  to  Seller  within  twenty  (20)  days  of  Seller&#8217;s  notice  to  Buyer  of  the       occurrence thereof, elect to either (i) terminate this Agreement, or (ii) consummate the       acquisition of the Property for the full Consideration, subject to the following.

If the proceeds or        awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then Seller&#8217;s right, title and interest to        such proceeds or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, and Seller will cooperate with Buyer        as reasonably requested by Buyer in the collection of such proceeds or award.  If Buyer        fails to give Seller notice within such twenty (20)-day period, then Buyer will be deemed        to have elected to terminate this Agreement.  If the Agreement is not terminated, Buyer        shall be responsible for performance by Buyer as &#8220;landlord&#8221; under the Leases, including        any repair obligations of landlord, and nothing herein shall limit Buyer&#8217;s repair obligations        or other obligations under the Leases.   13.

Subject  to  subsections  (c)(iii)  through  (c)(vi)  below,             Seller  shall  be  responsible  for  Tenant  Improvement  Allowances  and  Leasing             Commissions  for  all  Leases  (and  amendments  thereto)  entered  into  prior  to  the             Effective  Date,  and  Seller&#8217;s  obligations  with  respect  thereto  shall  survive  the             Closing.               (iii) Tenant Rights Under Existing Leases.
