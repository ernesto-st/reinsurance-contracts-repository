shall be the sole recourse to settle any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to a
breach or the interpretation of this Agreement, except as either party may be seeking injunctive
relief. Either party may file a demand for arbitration. The arbitration shall be held at a
mutually agreeable location, and shall be subject to and in accordance with the Employment
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect; provided that if the
location cannot be agreed upon the arbitration shall be held in Birmingham, Alabama. The
arbitrator may award any and all remedies allowable by the cause of action subject to the
arbitration, but the arbitrator&#146;s sole authority shall be to interpret and apply the provisions of
this Agreement. In reaching its decision the arbitrator shall have no authority to change or
modify any provision of this Agreement or other written agreement between the parties. The
arbitrator shall have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses at the hearing. Any court
having jurisdiction may enter a judgment based upon such arbitration. All decisions of the
arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties without appeal to any court. Upon execution
of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have waived any right to commence litigation
proceedings regarding this Agreement outside of arbitration or injunctive relief without the
express consent of ProAssurance. ProAssurance shall pay all arbitration fees and the arbitrator&#146;s
compensation. If the Executive prevails in the arbitration proceeding, ProAssurance shall
reimburse to the Executive the reasonable fees and expenses of Executive&#146;s personal counsel for his
or her professional services rendered to the Executive in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement.

<U><B>INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS Agreement is made effective as of the 2nd day of April, 2009, by and between ProAssurance
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and Jerry D. Brant (&#147;Indemnitee&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><U><B>Recitals</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company has adopted Bylaws (the &#147;Bylaws&#148;) which provide for the indemnification
of the directors, officers, agents, and employees of the Company in accordance with Section&nbsp;145 of
the General Corporation Laws of Delaware (the &#147;State Statute&#148;);
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the State Statute provides that it is not exclusive, and thus contemplates that
contracts may be entered into between the Company and the members of its Board of Directors and
Officers and employees of the Company with respect to the indemnification of such individuals;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, developments with respect to the terms, cost and availability of directors&#146; and
officers&#146; liability insurance (&#147;Liability Insurance&#148;) have raised questions regarding the adequacy
and reliability of the protection afforded to directors and officers thereby; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in order to resolve such questions and thereby induce the Indemnitee to continue to
perform services on behalf of the Company, the Company has determined and agreed to enter into this
contract with the Indemnitee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><U><B>Agreement</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and for the Indemnitee&#146;s agreement to serve as a director,
associate committee member, officer, employee or agent of the Company, and to render service on
behalf of the Company, the parties agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Liability Insurance</U>. The Company, as of the date of this Agreement, has acquired a
Liability Insurance policy. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to maintain Liability
Insurance during the term of this Agreement, but shall not be required to continue to maintain
Liability Insurance if in the sole business judgment of the directors then in office, (i)&nbsp;the
premium cost for such insurance is excessive, (ii)&nbsp;the premium cost for such insurance is not
reasonably related to the amount of coverage provided, of (iii)&nbsp;the coverage provided by such
insurance is so limited by its terms and exclusions or otherwise that sufficient benefit is not
derived therefrom.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Indemnity</U>. The Company agrees to indemnify and reimburse Indemnitee to the full
extent authorized and permitted by the provisions of the Bylaws of the Company and the laws of the
State of Delaware, and by any amendment thereof, authorizing or permitting such indemnification
which is adopted after the date hereof.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Additional Indemnity</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Subject only to the exclusions set forth in Section&nbsp;4 hereof, the Company shall indemnify
and reimburse Indemnitee under any circumstances where Indemnitee was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to a threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and whether formal or informal, including
an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director, associate committee member, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, associate committee member, officer, partner,
trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against reasonable expenses, including
attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding, if Indemnitee
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Company or its shareholders or policyholders, and with respect to a criminal
action or proceeding, if Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The termination of an action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of <I>nolo contendere </I>or its equivalent, does not, of itself, create a
presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or its shareholders or
policyholders, and, with respect to a criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The indemnification provided shall extend to all expenses and circumstances for which
indemnification is permitted under paragraph 3(a) above, that arise:

prior to or during the term of this Agreement; and,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 8%">(ii)&nbsp;Subsequent to the term of this Agreement based upon the activities of
Indemnitee prior to or during the term of this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The term &#147;Company&#148; shall for purposes of this Agreement include ProAssurance Corporation
and its direct and indirect majority-owned subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Limitations on Indemnity</U>. No indemnity pursuant to Section&nbsp;3 hereof shall be paid
by the Company:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;except to the extent the aggregate of losses to be indemnified hereunder exceed the amount
of such losses for which Indemnitee is indemnified either: pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 hereof; pursuant
to an Indemnification Agreement with any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; or,
pursuant to any Liability Insurance purchased and maintained by the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;1
hereof;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;in respect to remuneration paid to Indemnitee if it shall be determined by a final
judgment or other final adjudication that such remuneration was in violation of law;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;on account of any suit in which judgment is rendered against Indemnitee for an accounting
of profits made from the purchase or sale by Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to
the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or
similar provisions of any federal, state, or local statutory law;

action or suit was brought has determined upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnification for the expenses which the court considers proper; or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such
indemnification is not lawful.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Term of Agreement</U>. The original term of this Agreement shall be the twelve month
period immediately following the date of this Agreement. This Agreement shall renew for successive
one year terms unless sooner terminated upon termination of Indemnitee&#146;s position as an officer,
director or employee of the Company or upon delivery of written notice of termination by the
Company to the Indemnitee not less than 60&nbsp;days prior to the date of termination stated in the
notice. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification provided
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to all
actions or inactions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to or during the term of this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall remain binding upon the Company with respect to the covered
activities of Indemnitee occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to or during the term of this
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U>Notification and Defense of Claim</U>. Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice
of the commencement or threatened commencement of any action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company under this Agreement, notify the
Company of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve it
from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement. With
respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which Indemnitee notifies the Company of the
commencement thereof:

with any other indemnifying party similarly notified will be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel selected by the Company and consented to by Indemnitee, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from the Company to Indemnitee of its election so to
assume the defense thereof, the Company will not be liable to

Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or
as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in such
action, suit or proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after the notice from
the Company of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless
(i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Company, (ii)&nbsp;a conflict of
interest between the Company and Indemnitee exists in the conduct of the defense of such action; or
(iii)&nbsp;the Company shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in
each of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the
Company. The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding
brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which a conflict of interest exists between the
Company and Indemnitee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company shall not be liable to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid
in settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent. The Company shall not
settle any action or claim in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee
without Indemnitee&#146;s written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee will unreasonably
withhold its consent to any proposed settlement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>Payment of Indemnity</U>. Any indemnification or advance shall be made promptly and in
any event within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days, upon the written request of the director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company, unless a determination is reasonably and promptly made that such director,
officer, employee or agent failed to meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;3
hereof or that such director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnity under Section&nbsp;4
hereof. Such determination shall be made (l)&nbsp;by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a
quorum consisting of disinterested directors, or (2)&nbsp;by a committee of such directors designated by
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3)&nbsp;if such a quorum is not
obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4)&nbsp;by the stockholders. If the request for indemnification
involves an action, suit or proceeding that arises from the merger, consolidation, reorganization,
liquidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or other extraordinary transaction of
the Company, the inquiry and resolution thereof required by this Section&nbsp;7, at the option of the
person seeking indemnification, shall be made by a neutral person mutually acceptable to the
Company and the person seeking indemnification. If no disposition of such claim for
indemnification is made within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days, a favorable determination of entitlement to
indemnification shall be deemed to have been made. The expenses (including attorney&#146;s fees)
incurred by the person seeking indemnification in connection with successfully establishing such
person&#146;s right to indemnification, in whole or in part, shall also be indemnified by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>Repayment of Expenses</U>. Indemnitee agrees that he or she will reimburse the Company
for all reasonable expenses paid by the Company in defending any civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding against Indemnitee in the event and only to the extent that it shall be ultimately
determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company hereunder. The
undertaking to reimburse the Company for expenses is made pursuant to the requirements of the State
Statute. It is understood and agreed that no advances or payments

assumed the obligations imposed on the Company hereby in order to induce Indemnitee to serve and/or
continue to serve the Company, and acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
continuing to serve in such capacity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;In the event Indemnitee is required to bring any action to enforce rights and/or to
collect moneys due under this Agreement and is successful in such action, Company shall reimburse
Indemnitee for all of Indemnitee&#146;s reasonable fees and expenses in bringing and pursuing such
action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<U>Separability</U>. Each of the provisions of this Agreement is a separate and distinct
agreement and independent of the others, so that if any provision hereof shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable under applicable federal or state law or for any other reason, such
invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof.

of Delaware without effect to its conflict of law provisions, except to the extent that the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other federal laws preempt the applicable state
law to the enforceability or interpretation of this Agreement.

imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with
respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with such interest and penalties are
collectively referred to as the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), then the Executive will be entitled to receive an
additional payment (a &#147;Gross Up Payment&#148;). The amount of the Gross Up Payment will be such that
after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties, other than
interest and penalties imposed by reason of the Executive&#146;s failure to file a timely tax return or
pay taxes shown due on his return, imposed with respect to such taxes and the Excise Tax),
including any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the
Gross Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. The Executive shall be deemed
to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar
year for which the Excise Tax is to be paid.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;An initial determination as to whether a Gross Up Payment is required pursuant to this
Agreement and the amount of such Gross Up Payment shall be made by the Compensation Committee or
the Board of Directors of ProAssurance. In making such determination, the value of any non-cash
benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined in accordance with the principles
set forth in Sections&nbsp;280G(d)(3) and (4)&nbsp;of the Code. ProAssurance shall provide the determination
(&#147;Determination&#148;) together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Executive
within a reasonable time after the Date of Termination but not later than March&nbsp;15 in the calendar
year following the year in which the Date of Termination occurred. If ProAssurance determines that
no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall furnish
the Executive with an opinion of its income tax accountant or tax counsel to the effect that no
Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any Payment or Payments. Within ten days of the
delivery of the Determination to the Executive, the Executive shall have the right to dispute the
Determination. The Gross Up Payment, if any, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be
paid by the Companies to the Executive within 20&nbsp;days of the receipt of the Determination, but in
no event later than the end of the tax year next following the year the Executive remits the
related taxes. The existence of the Dispute shall not in any way affect the Executive&#146;s right to
receive Gross Up Payments in accordance with the Determination. Upon the final resolution of a
Dispute, the Companies shall promptly pay the Executive any additional amount required by such
resolution. If there is no Dispute, the Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon
the Companies and the Executive.

calendar days after the Executive knows or should have known that Good Reason has occurred.
Following the Executive&#146;s notice, the Companies shall have 45 calendar days to rectify the
circumstances causing the Good Reason. If the Companies fail to rectify the event(s) causing the

execution of the Release under Section 3(a) hereof shall be extended until sixty (60)&nbsp;days after
the decision by the arbitrator, and in such event, the Executive shall be paid Severance Benefits
after the execution of the Release as provided in Section 3(b) hereof and shall be reimbursed for

period specified under Section 3(a) hereof) between the termination of employment for COBRA
purposes and the Date of Termination as determined by the arbitrator .

arbitration shall be the sole recourse to settle any claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to a breach or the interpretation of this Agreement, except as either party may be seeking
injunctive relief. Either party may file for arbitration. A claimant seeking relief on a claim

arbitration within sixty (60)&nbsp;days following claimant&#146;s receipt of the Administrator&#146;s written
decision on review under Section 11(c) hereof, or if the Administrator fails to provide any written
decision under Section&nbsp;11 hereof, within 60&nbsp;days of the date on which such written decision was
required to be delivered to the claimant as therein provided. The arbitration shall be held at a
mutually agreeable location, and shall be subject to and in accordance with the arbitration rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association; provided that if the location cannot be
agreed upon the arbitration shall be held in either Birmingham, Alabama, or Chicago, Illinois,
whichever location is closer to the principal office where the Executive was employed on the Date

subject to the arbitration, but the arbitrator&#146;s sole authority shall be to interpret and apply the
provisions of this Agreement. In reaching its decision the arbitrator shall have no authority to
change or modify any provision of this Agreement or other written agreement between the parties.
The arbitrator shall have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses at the hearing. Any
court having jurisdiction may enter a judgment based upon such arbitration. All decisions of the
arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties without appeal to any court. Upon execution
of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed to have waived any right to commence litigation
proceedings regarding this Agreement outside of arbitration or injunctive relief without the
express consent of ProAssurance. The Companies shall pay all arbitration fees and the arbitrator&#146;s
compensation. If the Executive prevails in the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator may require
the Companies to reimburse the Executive for the reasonable fees and expenses of Executive&#146;s
personal counsel for his or her professional services rendered to the Executive in connection with
the enforcement of this Agreement.
