                                   SECTION II

                                CREDIT FACILITIES

         2.1. REVOLVING LOANS.

         (a) REVOLVING COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, each
Lender severally agrees to make available to the Borrower such Lender's
Revolving Commitment Percentage of revolving credit loans requested by the
Borrower in Dollars ("REVOLVING LOANS") from time to time from the Closing Date
until the Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Revolving Commitments shall
have been terminated as provided herein; provided, however, that the sum of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans shall not exceed TWO
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($200,000,000) (as such aggregate maximum amount may be
reduced from time to time as provided in Section 3.4, the "REVOLVING COMMITTED
AMOUNT"); provided, further, (A) with regard to each Lender individually, such
Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving
Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount, and (B) the sum of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations
plus Swingline Loans shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. The
initial advance of the Revolving Loans on the Closing Date shall consist solely
of Base Rate Loans. Thereafter, Revolving Loans may consist of Base Rate Loans
or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination thereof, as the Borrower may request;
provided, however, that no more than 15 Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding
hereunder at any time (it being understood that, for purposes hereof, Eurodollar
Loans with different Interest Periods shall be considered as separate Eurodollar
Loans, even if they begin on the same date, although borrowings, extensions and
conversions may, in accordance with the provisions hereof, be combined at the
end of existing Interest Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a
single Interest Period). Revolving Loans hereunder may be repaid and reborrowed
in accordance with the provisions hereof.

         (b) REVOLVING LOAN BORROWINGS.

               (i) NOTICE OF BORROWING. The Borrower shall request a Revolving
   Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
   writing) to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:30 P.M. (New York City
   time) on the Business Day prior to the date of the requested borrowing in the
   case of Base Rate Loans, and on the third Business Day prior to the date of
   the requested borrowing in the case of Eurodollar Loans. Each such request
   for borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Revolving
   Loan is requested, (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which shall be a
   Business Day), (C) the aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, and (D)
   whether the borrowing shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Loans
   or a combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the Interest
   Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to specify in any such Notice
   of Borrowing (I) an applicable Interest Period in the case of a Eurodollar
   Loan, then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period
   of one month, or (II) the type of Revolving Loan requested, then such notice
   shall be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan hereunder. The
   Administrative Agent shall give notice to each affected Lender promptly

                                                                              39




   upon receipt of each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i),
   the contents thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing to be made
   pursuant thereto.

               (ii) MINIMUM AMOUNTS. Except for Revolving Loans made for the
   purpose of reimbursing the Issuing Lender in respect of a drawing under a
   Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.2(e), each Eurodollar Loan that is a
   Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000
   and each Base Rate Loan that is a Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum
   aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 and, in each case, integral
   multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining amount of the
   Revolving Committed Amount, if less).

               (iii) ADVANCES. Each Lender will make its Revolving Commitment
   Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Administrative
   Agent for the account of the Borrower as specified in Section 3.15(a), or in
   such other manner as the Administrative Agent may specify in writing, by 1:00
   P.M. (New York City time) on the date specified in the applicable Notice of
   Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately available to the Administrative
   Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by the
   Administrative Agent either by disbursing such funds pursuant to written
   instructions from the Borrower or by crediting the account of the Borrower on
   the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made available to
   the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by the
   Administrative Agent.

         (c) REPAYMENT. The Borrower hereby promises to pay the principal amount
of all outstanding Revolving Loans in full on the Maturity Date, unless
accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

         (d) INTEREST. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,

               (i) BASE RATE LOANS. During such periods as Revolving Loans shall
   be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans, such Base Rate Loans
   shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate.

               (ii) EURODOLLAR LOANS. During such periods as Revolving Loans
   shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar Loans, such Eurodollar
   Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted
   Eurodollar Rate.

The Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on Revolving Loans in arrears on
each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be
specified herein).

         (e) REVOLVING NOTES. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the request
to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note evidencing the Revolving Loans of such Lender,
substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.1(e), with appropriate insertions as to
date and principal amount (a "REVOLVING NOTE").

                                                                              40

         2.2. LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

         (a) ISSUANCE. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in
reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, the Issuing
Lender agrees to issue, and each Lender severally agrees to participate in the
issuance by the Issuing Lender of, standby and trade Letters of Credit in
Dollars from time to time from the Closing Date until the date five (5) days
prior to the Maturity Date as the Borrower may request, in a form acceptable to
the Issuing Lender; provided, however, that (i) the LOC Obligations outstanding
shall not at any time exceed FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ($40,000,000) (the "LOC
COMMITTED AMOUNT") and (ii) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations plus Swingline Loans shall not at
any time exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. No Letter of Credit shall (x)
have an original expiry date more than one year from the date of issuance
(provided that any such Letter of Credit may contain customary "evergreen"
provisions pursuant to which the expiry date is automatically extended by a
specific time period unless the Issuing Lender gives notice to the beneficiary
of such Letter of Credit at least a specified time period prior to the expiry
date then in effect) or (y) as originally issued or as extended, have an expiry
date extending beyond the date five (5) days prior to the Maturity Date. The
Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue any Letter of Credit which would
violate any Requirement of Law applicable to the Issuing Lender. Each Letter of
Credit shall comply with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry
dates of each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day. For purposes of this
Credit Agreement, the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been
issued on the Closing Date.

         (b) NOTICE AND REPORTS. The request for the issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall be submitted by an Executive Officer of the Borrower to the Issuing
Lender and the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the requested date of issuance. The Issuing Lender will provide to the
Administrative Agent, at least quarterly and more frequently upon request, who
will in turn disseminate to each of the Lenders a detailed report specifying the
Letters of Credit which are then issued and outstanding and any activity with
respect thereto which may have occurred since the date of the prior report, and
including therein, among other things, the beneficiary, the face amount and the
expiry date, as well as any payment or expirations which may have occurred.

         (c) PARTICIPATION. Each Revolving Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of
Credit (or, in the case of each Existing Letter of Credit, on the Closing Date),
shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a Participation Interest from
the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and the obligations arising
thereunder and any collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal
to its pro rata share of the obligations under such Letter of Credit (based on
the respective Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Revolving Lenders) and
shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be obligated to pay
to the Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata share of the
obligations arising under such Letter of Credit. Without limiting the scope and
nature of each Revolving Lender's Participation Interest in any Letter of
Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as
required hereunder or under any such Letter of Credit, each such Revolving
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Lender its pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the
day of notification by the Administrative Agent of an unreimbursed drawing
pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) below. The obligation

                                                                              41

of each Revolving Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be absolute
and unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of a Default, an
Event of Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall
not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the
Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter
provided.

         (d) REIMBURSEMENT. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender that the Borrower intends to
otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender for such drawing, the Borrower shall be
deemed to have requested that the Revolving Lenders make a Revolving Loan in the
amount of the drawing as provided in subsection (e) below on the related Letter
of Credit, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the related
reimbursement obligations. The Borrower promises to reimburse the Issuing Lender
on the day on which the Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of a drawing under
any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan obtained
hereunder or deemed to have been requested hereunder or otherwise) in same day
funds provided such notice is received by the Borrower from the Issuing Lender
on or before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) (otherwise such payment shall be
made on or before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the Business Day next
succeeding the day such notice is received). The Borrower hereby promises to pay
to the Issuing Lender interest on the unreimbursed amount of any drawing under a
Letter of Credit at a per annum rate equal to (i) for the first two (2) Business
Days following the date of the related drawing, the Adjusted Base Rate and (ii)
thereafter, the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%. The Borrower's reimbursement
obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under all
circumstances irrespective of any rights of setoff, counterclaim or defense to
payment the Borrower may claim or have against the Issuing Lender (other than
that the payment of such drawing by the Issuing Lender constituted gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender),
the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter
of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including without limitation any
defense based on any failure of the Borrower or any other Credit Party to
receive consideration or the legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability
of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender will promptly notify the
Administrative Agent, who shall in turn, promptly notify the other Revolving
Lenders of the amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each Revolving Lender
shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds, the amount of such
Revolving Lender's pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing. Such payment
shall be made on the day such notice is received by such Revolving Lender from
the Administrative Agent if such notice is received at or before 2:00 P.M. (New
York City time), and otherwise such payment shall be made at or before 12:00
Noon (New York City time) on the Business Day next succeeding the day such
notice is received. If such Revolving Lender does not pay such amount to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in full upon such
request, such Revolving Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the
period from the date of such drawing until such Revolving Lender pays such
amount to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender in full
at a rate per annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date
that such Revolving Lender is required to make payments of such amount pursuant
to the preceding sentence, the Federal Funds Rate and thereafter at a rate equal
to the Base Rate. Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make such payment to the
Issuing Lender, and the right

                                                                              42

of the Issuing Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional,
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the
termination of this Credit Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the existence
of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder and shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever. Simultaneously with the making of each such payment by
a Revolving Lender to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Lender, such Revolving Lender shall, automatically and without any further
action on the part of the Issuing Lender or such Revolving Lender, acquire a
Participation Interest in an amount equal to such payment (excluding the portion
of such payment constituting interest owing to the Issuing Lender) in the
related unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest
thereon and in the related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against the
Borrower with respect thereto.

         (e) REPAYMENT WITH REVOLVING LOANS. On any day on which the Borrower
shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a Revolving Loan advance
to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall
give notice to the Revolving Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been requested or
deemed requested by the Borrower to be made in connection with a drawing under a
Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan advance comprised of Base Rate
Loans (or Eurodollar Loans to the extent the Borrower has complied with the
procedures of Section 2.1(b)(i) with respect thereto) shall be immediately made
to the Borrower by all Revolving Lenders (notwithstanding any termination of the
Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) pro rata based on the respective Revolving
Commitment Percentages of the Revolving Lenders (determined before giving effect
to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) and the proceeds
thereof shall be paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Issuing Lender for application to the respective LOC Obligations. Each such
Revolving Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro rata share of each
such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such request or deemed request in the
amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding sentence
notwithstanding (i) the amount of such borrowing may not comply with the minimum
amount for advances of Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii)
whether any conditions specified in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii)
whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such
request or deemed request for Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise
required hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which
Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi) any
termination of the Commitments relating thereto prior to or contemporaneously
with such borrowing. In the event that any Revolving Loan cannot for any reason
be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as
a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with
respect to the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each such Revolving
Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such
borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received
from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the
Issuing Lender such Participation Interests in the outstanding LOC Obligations
as shall be necessary to cause each such Revolving Lender to share in such LOC
Obligations ratably (based upon the respective Revolving Commitment Percentages
of the Revolving Lenders (determined before giving effect to any termination of
the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2)), provided that at the time any
purchase of Participation Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made,
the purchasing Revolving Lender shall be required to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender, to the extent






<Page>


                                                                              43

not paid to the Issuing Lender by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of
subsection (d) above, interest on the principal amount of Participation
Interests purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such
borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for
such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan advance, the Federal Funds Rate,
and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate.

         (f) DESIGNATION OF CONSOLIDATED PARTIES AS ACCOUNT PARTIES.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit Agreement,
including without limitation Section 2.2(a), a Letter of Credit issued hereunder
may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter of Credit is issued for
the account of any Subsidiary of the Borrower, provided that notwithstanding
such statement, the Borrower shall be the actual account party for all purposes
of this Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement shall not
affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect to such
Letter of Credit.

         (g) RENEWAL, EXTENSION. The renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as the
issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

         (h) UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES. The Issuing Lender may have the
Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits (the "UCP") or the International Standby Practices 1998 (the "ISP98"),
in either case as published as of the date of issue by the International Chamber
of Commerce, in which case the UCP or the ISP98, as applicable, may be
incorporated therein and deemed in all respects to be a part thereof.

         (i) INDEMNIFICATION; NATURE OF ISSUING LENDER'S DUTIES.

                  (i) In addition to its other obligations under this Section
         2.2, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify and save
         each Lender harmless from and against, any and all claims, demands,
         liabilities, damages, actual losses, costs, charges and reasonable
         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such Lender may
         incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the
         issuance of any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender to
         honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or
         omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de
         jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority (all such acts or
         omissions, herein called "GOVERNMENT ACTS").

                  (ii) As between the Borrower and the Lenders (including the
         Issuing Lender), the Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts,
         omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof.
         No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall be responsible: (A) for
         the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect
         of any document submitted by any party in connection with the
         application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it should
         in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
         inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the validity or sufficiency
         of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer
         or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
         proceeds thereof, in whole or

         in part, that may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason;
         (C) for errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or
         delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or
         otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay
         in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to
         make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and
         (E) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such
         Lender, including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of the
         above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing
         Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  (iii) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of
         the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or
         omitted by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), under or in
         connection with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if
         taken or omitted in good faith and without gross negligence, shall not
         put such Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower or any
         other Credit Party. It is the intention of the parties that this Credit
         Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and indemnify each
         Lender (including the Issuing Lender) against any and all risks
         involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which risks
         are hereby assumed by the Borrower (on behalf of itself and each of the
         other Credit Parties), including, without limitation, any and all
         Government Acts. No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall, in any
         way, be liable for any failure by such Lender or anyone else to pay any
         drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts
         or any other cause beyond the control of such Lender.

                  (iv) Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended to limit the
         reimbursement obligations of the Borrower contained in subsection (d)
         above. The obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (i) shall
         survive the termination of this Credit Agreement. No act or omission of
         any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way
         affect or impair the rights of the Lenders (including the Issuing
         Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Credit
         Agreement.

                  (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
         Section 2.2(i), no Credit Party shall have any obligation to indemnify
         or reimburse any Lender (including the Issuing Lender) in respect of
         any liability incurred by such Lender (A) arising out of the gross
         negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Lender, or (B)
         caused by such Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after
         presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
         conditions of such Letter of Credit unless such payment is prohibited
         by any law, regulation, court order or decree.

         (j) RESPONSIBILITY OF ISSUING LENDER. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder to the Lenders are
only those expressly set forth in this Credit Agreement and that the Issuing
Lender shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 5.2 have been satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge
that any such condition precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however,
that nothing set forth in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to prejudice the
right of any Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any amounts made
available by such Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.2 in
the event that it is determined by a

                                                                              45

court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of
Credit constituted gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part
of the Issuing Lender.

         (k) CONFLICT WITH LOC DOCUMENTS. In the event of any conflict between
this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of credit
application), this Credit Agreement shall control.

         2.3. SWINGLINE LOAN SUBFACILITY.

         (a) SWINGLINE COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, the
Swingline Lender, in its individual capacity, agrees to make certain revolving
credit loans requested by the Borrower in Dollars to the Borrower (each a
"SWINGLINE LOAN" and, collectively, the "SWINGLINE LOANS") from time to time
from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date for the purposes hereinafter set
forth; provided, however, (i) the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans
outstanding at any time shall not exceed TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ($20,000,000)
(the "SWINGLINE COMMITTED AMOUNT"), and (ii) the sum of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations plus
Swingline Loans shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. Swingline Loans
hereunder shall be made as Base Rate Loans or Quoted Rate Swingline Loans as the
Borrower may request in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3 and
may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

         (b) SWINGLINE LOAN ADVANCES.

                  (i) NOTICES; DISBURSEMENT. Whenever the Borrower desires a
         Swingline Loan advance hereunder it shall give written notice from an
         Executive Officer of the Borrower (or telephonic notice promptly
         confirmed in writing) to the Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 P.M.
         (New York City time) on the Business Day of the requested Swingline
         Loan advance. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
         (A) that a Swingline Loan advance is requested, (B) the date of the
         requested Swingline Loan advance (which shall be a Business Day) and
         (C) the principal amount of the Swingline Loan advance requested. Each
         Swingline Loan shall be made as a Base Rate Loan or a Quoted Rate
         Swingline Loan and shall have such maturity date as the Swingline
         Lender and the Borrower shall agree upon receipt by the Swingline
         Lender of any such notice from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall
         initiate the transfer of funds representing the Swingline Loan advance
         to the Borrower by 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day
         of the requested borrowing.

                  (ii) MINIMUM AMOUNTS. Each Swingline Loan advance shall be in
         integral multiples of $100,000 (or the remaining amount of the
         Swingline Committed Amount, if less).

                  (iii) REPAYMENT OF SWINGLINE LOANS. The Borrower hereby
         promises to pay the outstanding principal amount of each Swingline Loan
         on the earlier of (A) the Maturity Date or (B) the first date after
         such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or the last day of a
         calendar month and is at least three Business days after such






<Page>


                                                                              46

         Swingline Loan is made. The Swingline Lender may, at any time, in its
         sole discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and the Revolving
         Lenders, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by way of a Revolving
         Loan advance, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed to have
         requested a Revolving Loan advance comprised solely of Base Rate Loans
         in the amount of such Swingline Loans; provided, however, that any such
         demand shall be deemed to have been given one Business Day prior to the
         Maturity Date and on the date of the occurrence of any Event of Default
         described in Section 9.1 and upon acceleration of the indebtedness
         hereunder and the exercise of remedies in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 9.2. Each Revolving Lender hereby irrevocably
         agrees to make its pro rata share of each such Revolving Loan in the
         amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding
         sentence notwithstanding (I) the amount of such borrowing may not
         comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans
         otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether any conditions specified in
         Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (III) whether a Default or an Event of
         Default then exists, (IV) failure of any such request or deemed request
         for a Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required
         hereunder, (V) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which
         Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (VI)
         any termination of the Commitments relating thereto prior to or
         contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that any Revolving
         Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above
         (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a
         proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower or
         any other Credit Party), then each Revolving Lender hereby agrees that
         it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such borrowing would
         otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from
         the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the
         Swingline Lender such Participation Interests in the outstanding
         Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause each such Revolving
         Lender to share in such Swingline Loans ratably based upon its
         Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount
         (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
         pursuant to Section 3.4), provided that (A) all interest payable on the
         Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender
         until the date as of which the respective Participation Interest
         is purchased and (B) at the time any purchase of Participation
         Interests pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing
         Revolving Lender shall be required to pay to the Swingline Lender, to
         the extent not paid to the Swingline Lender by the Borrower in
         accordance with the terms of subsection (c)(ii) below, interest on the
         principal amount of Participation Interests purchased for each day from
         and including the day upon which such borrowing would otherwise have
         occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such Participation
         Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days
         of the date upon which such borrowing would otherwise have occurred,
         the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Adjusted
         Base Rate.

         (c) INTEREST ON SWINGLINE LOANS.

                  (i) RATE OF INTEREST. Subject to the provisions of Section
         3.1, each Swingline Loan shall bear interest as follows:






<Page>


                                                                              47


                  (A)      BASE RATE LOANS. If such Swingline Loan is a Base
                           Rate Loan, at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted
                           Base Rate.

                  (B)      QUOTED RATE SWINGLINE LOANS. If such Swingline Loan
                           is a Quoted Rate Swingline Loan, at a per annum rate
                           equal to the Quoted Rate applicable thereto.

                  (ii) PAYMENT OF INTEREST. The Borrower hereby promises to pay
         interest on Swingline Loans in arrears on each applicable Interest
         Payment Date (or at such other times as may be specified herein).

         Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary set forth in this
         Credit Agreement, in the event that the principal amount of any Quoted
         Rate Swingline Loan is not repaid on the last day of the Interest
         Period for such Loan, then such Loan shall be automatically converted
         into a Base Rate Loan at the end of such Interest Period.

         (d) SWINGLINE NOTE. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the request
to the Administrative Agent by the Swingline Lender, the Borrower will execute
and deliver to the Swingline Lender a promissory note evidencing the Swingline
Loans of the Swingline Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.3(d), with
appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a "SWINGLINE NOTE").

         2.4. [INTENTIONALLY DELETED].

         2.5. TRANCHE B TERM LOAN.

         (a) TRANCHE B TERM COMMITMENT. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein,
each Lender severally agrees to make available to the Borrower on the Closing
Date such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan Percentage of a term loan in Dollars (the
"TRANCHE B TERM LOAN") in the aggregate principal amount of TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY
MILLION DOLLARS ($270,000,000) (the "TRANCHE B TERM LOAN COMMITTED AMOUNT"). The
full principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan shall be disbursed on the
Closing Date as a Base Rate Loan. Thereafter, the Tranche B Term Loan may
consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination thereof, as the
Borrower may request; provided, however, that no more than 15 Eurodollar Loans
shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood that, for
purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall be
considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same date,
although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance with the
provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to
constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period). Amounts repaid
on the Tranche B Term Loan may not be reborrowed.

         (b) BORROWING PROCEDURES. The Borrower shall submit an appropriate
Notice of Borrowing for the Tranche B Term Loan to the Administrative Agent not
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Closing Date. Such Notice of
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) that the funding of the
Tranche B Term Loan is requested and (ii) that the funding of the Tranche B Term
Loan shall be comprised of Base Rate

                                                                              48

Loans. Each Lender shall make its Tranche B Term Loan Percentage of the Tranche
B Term Loan available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in Schedule 2.1(a),
or at such other office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, by
1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the Closing Date in Dollars and in funds
immediately available to the Administrative Agent.

         (c) MINIMUM AMOUNTS. Each Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan that is
part of the Tranche B Term Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount that
is not less than $2,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 (or the then
remaining principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan).

         (d) REPAYMENT OF TRANCHE B TERM LOAN. The Borrower hereby promises to
pay the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan in twenty-four
(24) consecutive quarterly installments as follows (as such installments may
hereafter be adjusted as a result of prepayments made pursuant to Section 3.3),
unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2:

         (e) INTEREST. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1, the outstanding
Tranche B Term Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to:

                  (i) BASE RATE LOANS. During such periods as the Tranche B Term
         Loan shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans, such
         Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         Adjusted Base Rate.

                  (ii) EURODOLLAR LOANS. During such periods as the Tranche B
         Term Loan shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar Loans,
         such Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to
         the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

The Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on the Tranche B Term Loan in
arrears on each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may
be specified herein).

         (f) TRANCHE B TERM NOTES. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the
request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and

such Lender a promissory note evidencing the Tranche B Term Loan of such Lender,
substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.5(f), with appropriate insertions as to

                                  SECTION III

                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

         3.1. DEFAULT RATE.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of a default in the
payment of any amount hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2%
greater than the rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is
applicable, whether in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then the
Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%).

         3.2. EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
provided in Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans
or extended as Eurodollar Loans for new Interest Periods only on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto unless the Borrower makes payment of any
amounts then due and owing pursuant to Section 3.12, (ii) Loans extended as, or
converted into, Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition
of "INTEREST PERIOD" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum
amounts as provided in, with respect to Revolving Loans, Section 2.1(b)(ii), or,
with respect to the Tranche B Term Loan, Section 2.5(c), (iii) no more than 15
Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood
that, for purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods
shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same
date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance with
the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to
constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period), (iv) any
request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan which shall fail to
specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest
Period of one month and (v) Swingline Loans may not be extended or converted
pursuant to this Section 3.2. Each such extension or conversion shall be
effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the office of the
Administrative Agent specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at such other office as
the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the Business Day of, in the case of the conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and on the third Business Day prior to, in the case
of the extension of a Eurodollar Loan as, or conversion of a Base Rate Loan
into, a Eurodollar Loan, the date of the proposed extension or conversion,
specifying the date of the proposed extension or conversion, the Loans to be so
extended or converted, the types of Loans into which such Loans are to be
converted and, if appropriate, the applicable Interest Periods with respect
thereto. In the event the Borrower fails to request

                                                                              50

extension or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan in accordance with this Section
3.2, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or required by this
Section 3.2, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically converted into a
Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The
Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of
any such proposed extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

         3.3. PREPAYMENTS.

         (a) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay
Loans in whole or in part from time to time upon providing at least three (3)
Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice may be waived by
the Administrative Agent) other than in connection with Revolving Loans;
provided, however, that each partial prepayment of Loans (other than Swingline
Loans) shall be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000,000 (or $500,000 in the
case of Revolving Loans) and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof
(or the then remaining principal balance of the Revolving Loans or the Tranche B
Term Loan, as applicable, if less). Subject to the foregoing terms, amounts
prepaid under this Section 3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect;
provided that if the Borrower shall fail to specify with respect to any
voluntary prepayment, such voluntary prepayment shall be applied first to
Swingline Loans, then Revolving Loans and then to the Tranche B Term Loan (and
applied to the remaining Principal Amortization Payments ratably), in each case
first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of
Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 3.3(a) shall be
subject to Section 3.12, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and, in the
case of Eurodollar Loans, shall be accompanied by interest on the principal
amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

         (b) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

                  (i) (A) REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT. If at any time, the sum of
         the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC
         Obligations plus Swingline Loans shall exceed the Revolving Committed
         Amount, the Borrower immediately shall prepay the Revolving Loans and
         (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid) cash collateralize the LOC
         Obligations, in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                      (B) LOC COMMITTED AMOUNT. If at any time, the sum of the
         aggregate principal amount of LOC Obligations shall exceed the LOC
         Committed Amount, the Borrower immediately shall cash collateralize the
         LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                  (ii) EXCESS CASH FLOW. Within 105 days after the end of each
         fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003), the
         Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an amount equal to (A) 50% (if the
         Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of such fiscal year is equal
         to or greater than 3.50 to 1.00) or 25% (if the Consolidated Leverage
         Ratio as of the end of such fiscal year is less than 3.50 to 1.00 but
         equal to or greater than 3.00 to 1.00) of Excess Cash Flow for such
         fiscal year minus (B) the amount of any voluntary prepayments made
         during such fiscal year of the Tranche B Term Loan or (to the extent
         accompanied by a permanent reduction in the

         Discontinued Operation Sale not applied (or caused to be applied) by
         the Credit Parties during the related Application Period to make

         below).

                  (iv) DEBT ISSUANCES. Immediately upon the occurrence of a Debt
         Issuance Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an
         aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of the related

         (vi) below).

                  (v) EQUITY ISSUANCES. Immediately upon the occurrence of an
         Equity Issuance Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
         in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (A) 50% of the Net Cash

         Net Cash Proceeds of the issuance of any Qualified Preferred Stock
         pursuant to Section 8.1(p) shall be applied to repayment of the Loans
         as set forth in clause (vi) below upon receipt thereof.

                  (vi) APPLICATION OF MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. All amounts
         required to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be applied as
         follows: (A) with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant to Section
         3.3(b)(i)(A), to Revolving Loans and (after all Revolving Loans have
         been repaid) to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC
         Obligations, (B) with respect to all amounts prepaid pursuant to
         Section 3.3(b)(i)(B), to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC

         all amounts prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(iii), 3.3(b)(iv) and
         3.3(b)(v), FIRST, to the Tranche B Term Loans (with such prepayment
         being applied ratably to the remaining Principal Amortization Payments
         thereof) and SECOND, to the Revolving Loans and (after all Revolving
         Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC
         Obligations (without any reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount).
         Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments
         shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans
         in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under
         this Section 3.3(b) shall be subject to Section 3.12, but otherwise
         without premium or penalty, and shall, in the

                                                                              52

         case of Eurodollar Loans, be accompanied by interest on the principal
         amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

                  (vii) PREPAYMENT ACCOUNT. If the Borrower is required to make
         a mandatory prepayment of Eurodollar Loans under this Section 3.3(b),
         the Borrower shall have the right, in lieu of making such prepayment in
         full, to deposit an amount equal to such mandatory prepayment with the
         Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account maintained (pursuant
         to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent)
         by and in the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent.
         Any amounts so deposited shall be held by the Administrative Agent as
         collateral for the prepayment of such Eurodollar Loans and shall be
         applied to the prepayment of the applicable Eurodollar Loans at the end
         of the current Interest Periods applicable thereto or, subject to the
         terms of Section 3.12, as earlier requested in writing by the Borrower.
         At the request of the Borrower, amounts so deposited shall be invested
         by the Administrative Agent in Cash Equivalents maturing prior to the
         date or dates on which it is anticipated that such amounts will be
         applied to prepay such Eurodollar Loans; any interest earned on such
         Cash Equivalents will be for the account of the Borrower and the
         Borrower will deposit with the Administrative Agent the amount of any
         loss on any such Cash Equivalents to the extent necessary in order that
         the amount of the prepayment to be made with the deposited amounts may
         not be reduced.

                  (viii) NOTICE OF MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower agrees to
         use reasonable efforts to notify the Administrative Agent of any
         mandatory prepayments of the Loans required to be made pursuant to this
         Section 3.3(b).

         3.4. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITTED AMOUNT.

         (a) VOLUNTARY REDUCTIONS. The Borrower may from time to time
permanently reduce or terminate the Revolving Committed Amount in whole or in
part (in minimum aggregate amounts of $2,500,000 or in integral multiples of
$100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the full remaining amount of the then
applicable Revolving Committed Amount)) upon five Business Days' prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent; provided, however, no such termination or
reduction shall be made which would cause the sum of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations plus Swingline Loans to
exceed the Revolving Committed Amount, unless, concurrently with such
termination or reduction, the Revolving Loans are repaid to the extent necessary
to eliminate such excess. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
affected Lender of receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).

         (b) TERM LOAN COMMITMENTS. The Tranche B Term Loan Commitment of each
Lender, if any, shall automatically terminate at such time as such Lender shall
have made available to the Borrower such Lender's share of the Tranche B Term
Loan.

         (c) MANDATORY REDUCTIONS. The Revolving Committed Amount and the
Swingline Committed Amount automatically shall be permanently reduced from time
to time in accordance with the terms of Section 3.3(b)(vi).

                                                                              53

         (d) MATURITY DATE. Unless terminated sooner pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
or Section 9.2, the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders and the LOC Commitment
of the Issuing Lender shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

         (e) GENERAL. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the

Lender during the applicable period in which such fee accrued) in accordance
with the terms of Section 3.5(a), on the date of each termination or reduction
of the Revolving Committed Amount, the Unused Fee accrued through the date of
such termination or reduction on the amount of the Revolving Committed Amount so
terminated or reduced.

         3.5. FEES.

         (a) UNUSED FEE. In consideration of the Revolving Commitments of the
Lenders hereunder, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender (except to the extent that any Lender was a
Defaulting Lender during the applicable period in which such fee accrued) a fee
(the "UNUSED FEE") on the Unused Revolving Committed Amount computed at a per
annum rate for each day during the applicable Unused Fee Calculation Period
(hereinafter defined) at a rate equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect
from time to time. The Unused Fee shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date

thereof for which the Unused Fee is payable hereunder being herein referred to
as an "UNUSED FEE CALCULATION PERIOD"), beginning with the first of such dates
to occur after the Closing Date.

         (b) LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

                  (i) STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT ISSUANCE FEE. In consideration of
         the issuance of standby Letters of Credit hereunder, the Borrower
         hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
         each Lender (except to the extent that any Lender was a Defaulting
         Lender during the applicable period in which such fee accrued) a fee
         (the "STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT FEE") on such Lender's Revolving
         Commitment Percentage of the average daily maximum amount available to
         be drawn under each such standby Letter of Credit computed at a per
         annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date of
         expiration equal to the Applicable Percentage. The Standby Letter of
         Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business
         Day of each March, June, September and December for the immediately
         preceding quarter (or a portion thereof) and on the Maturity Date for
         the Revolving Commitments.

                  (ii) TRADE LETTER OF CREDIT DRAWING FEE. In consideration of
         the issuance of trade Letters of Credit hereunder, the Borrower hereby
         promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
         Lender (except to the extent that any Lender was a Defaulting Lender
         during the applicable period in which such fee accrued) a fee (the
         "TRADE LETTER OF CREDIT FEE") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment
         Percentage of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn






<Page>


                                                                              54

         under each such trade Letter of Credit computed at a per annum rate for
         each day from the date of issuance to the date of expiration equal to
         1.25%. The Trade Letter of Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in
         arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
         December for the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof)
         and on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Commitments.

                  (iii) ISSUING LENDER FEES. In addition to the Standby Letter
         of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (i) above and the Trade Letter
         of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower
         hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
         the Issuing Lender without sharing by the other Lenders (i) a letter of
         credit fronting fee of 0.125% on the average daily maximum amount
         available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit computed at a per
         annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date of
         expiration (which fronting fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on
         the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December for
         the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof)) and on the
         Maturity Date for the Revolving Commitments and (ii) the customary
         charges from time to time of the Issuing Lender with respect to the
         issuance, amendment, transfer, administration, cancellation and

         (c) ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S FEES. The Borrower hereby (i) absolutely
accepts and assumes all of the duties, obligations and liabilities of the
Sponsor in, to and under the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter to the same
extent as if the Borrower had executed the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter and
(ii) promises to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account and for
the account of JPMorgan Securities Inc., as applicable, the fees referred to in
the Administrative Agent's Fee Letter.

         3.6. CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         (a) If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the
adoption or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or
compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon notice from such Lender
through the Administrative Agent to the Borrower setting forth in reasonable
detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return to the
Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction to the
extent that such Lender reasonably determines that such additional amount is
allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitments or obligations
hereunder. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this
Section shall, absent demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto.

                                                                              55

         (b ) The Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant
to this Section 3.6 for any additional amounts incurred more than 180 days prior
to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change of law giving
rise to such additional amounts and of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided that, if the change of law giving rise to such
additional amounts is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above
shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

         3.7. LIMITATION ON EURODOLLAR LOANS. If on or prior to the first day of
any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan:

         (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market,
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate
for such Interest Period; or

         (b) the Required Lenders determine (which determination shall be
conclusive) and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Eurodollar
Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and
so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no
obligation to make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to
Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the
last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Eurodollar Loans or Convert such Eurodollar
Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit
Agreement. The Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be,
will withdraw such determination pursuant to this Section promptly as
circumstances allow.

         3.8. ILLEGALITY.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, in the
event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office
to make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lender's obligation to make or
Continue Eurodollar Loans and to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and
fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable). Each Lender will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if
such designation will permit such Lender to continue to make, maintain, or fund
Eurodollar Loans hereunder and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise materially disadvantageous to it.

         3.9. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

         (a) If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law,
rule, or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation,
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not






<Page>


                                                                              56

having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or
comparable agency:

                  (i) shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
         Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any
         Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change
         the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender (or its
         Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement in respect of
         any Eurodollar Loans (other than Taxes and taxes imposed on the overall
         net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has
         its principal office or such Applicable Lending Office);

                  (ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the
         Eurodollar Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the
         Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other
         assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of,
         such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office), including the
         Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or

                  (iii) shall impose on such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
         Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
         this Credit Agreement or any of such extensions of credit or
         liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase, by an amount deemed by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to be material, the cost to such
Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, Converting into,
Continuing, or maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or
receivable by such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit
Agreement with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender on demand such amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender requests compensation by the
Borrower under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender
to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
Lender to receive the compensation so requested. Each Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender,
be otherwise materially disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming compensation
under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of
demonstrable error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

         (b) The Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant
to this Section 3.9 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180
days prior to the






<Page>


                                                                              57

date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change of law giving rise to
such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided that, if the change of law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

         3.10. TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.

         If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s)
of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the
case of a Conversion required by Section 3.8, on such earlier date as required
by law as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided
below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that
gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

         (a) to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans have been so
Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be
applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be applied instead to its Base
Rate Loans; and

         (b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender
as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and
all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into
Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that
gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this
Section 3.10 no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such
circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other
Lenders are outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically
Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for
such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving
effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by
such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

         3.11. TAXES.

         (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all payments by any
Credit Party to or for the account of any Lender or the Administrative Agent
hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
thereto, EXCLUDING, in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent,
taxes imposed on it as a result of a present or former connection between the
Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental
Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein (other than






<Page>


                                                                              58

any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment
under, or enforced this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document) (all such
non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings,
and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If any Credit Party
shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document to any Lender
or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary
so that after making all required deductions of Taxes (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.11) such Lender or
the Administrative Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make
such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at
its address referred to in Section 11.1, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no additional
sums shall be payable pursuant to this Section 3.11(a) with respect to Taxes (A)
that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with Section 3.11(d),
or (B) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to
such Lender at the time the Lender becomes a party to this Credit Agreement or
(C) unless imposed as a result of a change in treaty, law or regulation.

         (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document or from the execution or delivery of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
(hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

         (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative
Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 3.11) paid by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.

         (d) Each Lender that is not a United States person under Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this Credit Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on the signature
pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender in the
case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in
writing by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but only so long as such
Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI,
as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an income tax
treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces to zero the rate of
withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the income receivable
pursuant to this Credit Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States, (ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8
or W-9, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service, and/or (iii) any other form or certificate required by any taxing
authority (including any certificate required by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of
the Code), certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from tax on
payments pursuant to






<Page>


                                                                              59

this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents. In addition, each
Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of
any form previously delivered by such Lender. Each Lender shall promptly notify
the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to
provide any previously delivered form to the Borrower (or any other form adopted
by the United States taxing authorities for such purposes).

         (e) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to
Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law, or
regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 3.11(a) or 3.11(b) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United
States; provided, however, that should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from
withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a
form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall
reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

         (f) If any Credit Party is required to pay additional amounts to or for
the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.11, then such Lender will
agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable
Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which
may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Lender, is not
otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

         (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit Parties
contained in this Section 3.11 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination
of the Commitments hereunder.

         (h) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a refund with
respect to Taxes paid by the Borrower, which in the good faith judgment of such
Lender is allocable to such payment, the Administrative Agent or Lender,
respectively shall promptly pay such refund, together with any other amounts
paid by the Borrower in connection with such refunded Taxes, to the Borrower,
net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender incurred in obtaining such
refund, provided, however, that the Borrower agrees to promptly return such
refund to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be,
if it receives notice from the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender that
such Administrative Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund. Each of
the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees that it will contest such Taxes
or liabilities if the Administrative Agent or such Lender determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that it would not be materially disadvantaged or prejudiced
as a result of such contest.

         3.12. COMPENSATION.

         Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense (excluding loss of
anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:






<Page>


                                                                              60

         (a) any payment, prepayment, or Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan or
Quoted Rate Swingline Loan for any reason (other than in connection with any
assignment by any Lender pursuant to Section 11.3(b), but including acceleration
of the Loans pursuant to Section 9.2) on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan; or

         (b) any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without
limitation, the failure of any condition precedent specified in Section 5 to be
satisfied) to borrow, Convert, Continue, or prepay a Eurodollar Loan or Quoted
Rate Swingline Loan on the date for such borrowing, Conversion, Continuation, or
prepayment specified in the relevant notice of borrowing, prepayment,
Continuation, or Conversion under this Credit Agreement.

With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest (other than the
Applicable Percentage) which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not
so borrowed, Converted or Continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, Convert or Continue to the last day of
the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, Convert
or Continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar
Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Percentage
included therein, if any) over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such
amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading
banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. Any Lender claiming compensation under
this Section 3.12 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amounts to
be paid to it hereunder. The covenants of the Borrower set forth in this Section
3.12 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other
obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments
hereunder; provided, however, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender pursuant to this Section 3.12 for any such loss, cost or expense incurred
more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of
the incurrence of such loss, cost or expense.

         3.13. PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

         (a) LOANS. Each Loan, each payment or (subject to the terms of Section
3.3) prepayment of principal of any Loan or reimbursement obligations arising
from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of interest on the Loans or
reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each
payment of Unused Fees, each payment of the Standby Letter of Credit Fee, each
payment of the Trade Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction of the Revolving
Committed Amount and each conversion or extension of any Loan, shall be
allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal
amounts of their outstanding Loans of the applicable type and Participation
Interests in Loans of the applicable type and Letters of Credit.

         (b) ADVANCES. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay
by any other Lender in its obligation to make its ratable share of a borrowing
hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its
obligations hereunder shall not relieve any






<Page>


                                                                              61

other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any requested borrowing
that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent
its ratable share of such borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the
Administrative Agent on the date of such borrowing, and the Administrative Agent
in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion but without any
obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If
such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding
amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount
forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall promptly pay
such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case
may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the
date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the
Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the
applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing
and (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.

         3.14. SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         (a) The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any
Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among
themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a
Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law and in a manner not inconsistent
with this Credit Agreement, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff,
banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such Participation Interest as
fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan, LOC Obligations or other
obligation in the amount of such Participation Interest. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit
to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender
to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit
Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made
together with interest thereon for each date






<Page>


                                                                              62

from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the
Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to, for the
first two days, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter, the Adjusted Base Rate.
If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender
receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies,
such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of
such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under
this Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured
claim.

         3.15. PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

         (a) GENERALLY. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in
immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or
withholding of any kind, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in
Schedule 2.1(a) not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date when
due. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on
the next succeeding Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any
payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the
Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower
hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails
so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms
hereof, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in
such manner as the Administrative Agent may determine to be appropriate in
respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder, subject to the terms of
Sections 3.3 and 3.13(a)). The Administrative Agent will distribute such
payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 2:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the
end of such Business Day and otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute
such payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any
payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business
Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
(subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such extension),
except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the
payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall
instead be made on the next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided
otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the
basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with
respect to computation of interest on Base Rate Loans which shall be calculated
based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. Interest shall accrue from
and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of payment.

         (b) ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER ACCELERATION. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after acceleration of
the Credit Party Obligations pursuant to Section 9.2(b), all amounts collected
or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit
Party Obligations or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or
delivered as follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of
         the Lenders under the Credit Documents and any






<Page>


                                                                              63

         protective advances made by the Administrative Agent with respect to
         the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral
         Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees payable to the Administrative
         Agent then due and owing;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
         consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Credit Party Obligations (including the payment or cash
         collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations);

                  FIFTH, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under
         the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

                  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other
         obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit
         Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST"
         through "FIFTH" above; and

                  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever
         may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to
its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans and
LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding
Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to
clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent
that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are
attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit,
such amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral
account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time
for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the
expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types
described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this
Section 3.15(b).

         3.16. EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

         (a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each
Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to
maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its
account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.

         (b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
Section 11.3(b), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and
subaccounts (taken together)






<Page>


                                                                              64

shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan
hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of any
Credit Party and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make
reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in
the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to
time, as necessary.

         (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts
maintained pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 3.16 (and, if consistent with
the entries of the Administrative Agent, clause (a)) shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties
therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such
subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect
the obligation of the Credit Parties to repay the Credit Party Obligations owing
to such Lender.

         3.17. REPLACEMENT OF AFFECTED LENDERS.

         If (i) any Lender having a Revolving Commitment becomes a Defaulting
Lender or otherwise defaults in its Revolving Commitment, (ii) any Credit Party
is required to make any payments to any Lender under Section 3.6, Section 3.8,
Section 3.9 or Section 3.11 in excess of the proportionate amount (based on the
respective Commitments and/or Loans of the Lenders) of corresponding payments
required to be made to the other Lenders or (iii) in the event of a refusal by a
Lender to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination which
requires only the consent of the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall have the
right to replace such Lender (the "REPLACED LENDER") with one or more other
Eligible Assignee or Eligible Assignees, none of whom shall constitute a
Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the
"REPLACEMENT LENDER"), provided that (a) except in the case of clause (iii)
above, no Event of Default then exists, (b) at the time of any replacement
pursuant to this Section 3.17, the Replaced Lender and Replacement Lender shall
enter into an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which the Replacement Lender
shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the Commitments and
outstanding Loans of, and participation in Letters of Credit by, the Replaced
Lender and (c) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender
relating to the Loans so replaced (including, without limitation, such increased
costs and excluding those specifically described in clause (b) above in respect
of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being paid)
shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such
replacement. Upon the execution of the appropriate Assignment and Acceptance,
the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (b) and (c) above and, if so
requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the Replacement Lender of the
appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall
become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a
Lender hereunder with respect to such replaced Loans, except with respect to
indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such
Replaced Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, (1)
the Lender that acts as the Issuing Lender may not be replaced hereunder at any
time that it has Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements
satisfactory to the Issuing Lender (including the furnishing of a back-up
standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer,
satisfactory to such Issuing Lender or the depositing of cash






<Page>


                                                                              65

collateral into a cash collateral account maintained with the Administrative
Agent in amounts and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to such Issuing
Lender) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit and
(2) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced
hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 10.7. The Replaced
Lender shall be required to deliver for cancellation its applicable Notes, if
any, to be canceled on the date of replacement, or if any such Note is lost or
unavailable, such other assurances or indemnification therefor as the Borrower
may reasonably request.

                                   SECTION IV

                                    GUARANTY

         4.1. THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement, and the
Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as
surety, the prompt payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a
mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the
terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit
Party Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as
a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization
or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the
same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations,
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity,
as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension
or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, the maximum liability
of each Guarantor under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents
shall in no event exceed the maximum amount which can be guaranteed by such
Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of
debtors and fraudulent conveyance or transfers (after giving effect to the right
of contribution established in Section 4.6).

         4.2. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall

                                                                              66

have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against
the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section IV until
such time as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall
remain absolute and unconditional as described above:

         (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor,
the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Credit Party
Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be
waived;

         (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the
Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and any
Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements shall be done or
omitted;

         (c) the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be increased,
modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the
Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and any
Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements shall be waived
or released or any other guarantee of any of the Credit Party Obligations or any
security therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part
or otherwise dealt with;

         (d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or
any Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations shall
fail to attach or be perfected or shall be released; or

         (e) any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be determined to be void
or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor of
any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including,
without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender
exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of
the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and
any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements, or against any

                                                                              67

Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

         4.4. CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this Section IV,
each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to
security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the exercise of rights
of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights of
contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

         4.5. REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be
forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to
have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said
Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents and that the
Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms
thereof.

         4.6. RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the Credit Party Obligations until such time
as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied, and none of the
Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any
other Guarantor until such Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied.
For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) "EXCESS PAYMENT" shall mean the amount
paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Guaranteed
Obligations; (b) "PRO RATA SHARE" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of
any payment of Credit Party Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage)
as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and
properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other
properties of all

                                                                              68

of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of the Credit
Parties; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata
Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Credit Party Obligations,
any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such payment
shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and the
financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a
Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such payment;
and (C) "CONTRIBUTION SHARE" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any
Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a
percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds
the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent,
subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of the
Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of
all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit
Parties) of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment;
provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of
the Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a
Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to
have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial
information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor
shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment.
This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation,
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under
applicable law against the Borrower in respect of any payment of Guaranteed
Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of contribution against
any Guarantor shall terminate from and after such time, if ever, that such
Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to Section 8.5.

         4.7. GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Section IV is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

                                   SECTION V

         6.1. FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         (a) The audited consolidated balance sheets and income statements of
the Consolidated Parties for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1999, June 30, 2000
and June 30, 2001 (including the notes thereto) (i) have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby and (iii) present

(contingent or otherwise) that are not reflected (but required to be reflected)
in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect except as described on
Schedule 6.1.

         (b) The pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of March 30, 2002 and

based upon reasonable assumptions made known to the Lenders and upon information
not known to be incorrect or misleading in any material respect.

         (c) To the extent delivered, the financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 7.1(a) and (b) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except as may otherwise be permitted under Section 7.1(a) and (b)) and present

Section 7.1(b), the absence of footnotes and subject to year-end audit
adjustments).

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
6.1, it is understood and agreed by the Lenders that it is possible that the

409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any
agreement or other instrument pursuant to which any Consolidated Party or any

any transaction which is subject to the prohibitions of Sections 404, 406 or 407
of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section

         (l) OTHER INFORMATION. With reasonable promptness upon any such
request, such other information regarding the business, properties or financial
condition of any Consolidated Party as the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders may reasonably request.

         7.2. PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE AND FRANCHISES.

         Except as a result of or in connection with a dissolution, merger or
disposition of a Subsidiary not prohibited by Section 8.4 or Section 8.5, each
Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, do all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights,
franchises except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         7.3. BOOKS AND RECORDS.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
keep complete and accurate books and records of its transactions in accordance

                                                                              86

         7.5. PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER CLAIMS.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay
and discharge (a) all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
levies imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits, or upon any of its
properties, before they shall become delinquent and (b) all material lawful
claims (including claims for labor, materials and supplies) which, if unpaid,
might give rise to a Lien upon any of its properties (other than a Permitted
Lien); provided, however, that no Consolidated Party shall be required to pay
any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim which (i) is being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which adequate reserves therefor
have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless the failure to make any
such payment could give rise to an immediate right to foreclose on a Lien
securing such amounts or (ii) could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         7.6. INSURANCE.

         (a) Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
at all times maintain in full force and effect insurance (including worker's
compensation insurance, liability insurance, casualty insurance and business
interruption insurance) in such amounts, covering such risks and liabilities and
with such deductibles or self-insurance retentions as are in accordance with
customary industry practice. The Administrative Agent shall be named as loss
payee or mortgagee, as its interest may appear, and/or additional insured with
respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect of any Collateral,
and each provider of any such insurance shall agree, by endorsement upon the
policy or policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to the
Administrative Agent, that it will give the Administrative Agent thirty (30)
days prior written notice before any such policy or policies shall be amended or
cancelled. The insurance coverage of the Consolidated Parties as of the Closing
Date is outlined as to carrier, policy number, expiration date, type and amount
on Schedule 7.6.

         (b) In the event that the Consolidated Parties receive Net Cash
Proceeds from property damage or casualty insurance in excess of $1,000,000 in
aggregate amount during any fiscal year of the Consolidated Parties ("EXCESS
PROCEEDS") on account of Involuntary Dispositions, the Credit Parties shall,
within the period of 540 days following the date of receipt of such Excess
Proceeds, either (i) prepay the Loans (and cash collateralize the LOC
Obligations) in accordance with the terms of Section 3.3(b)(iii)(B) or (ii)
apply (or cause to be applied) an amount equal to such Excess Proceeds to make
Eligible Reinvestments (including but not limited to the repair or replacement
of the related Property); provided, however, that such Consolidated Party need
not repair or replace the Property of such Consolidated Party so lost, damaged
or destroyed to the extent the failure to make such repair or replacement (i) is
desirable to the proper conduct of the business of such Consolidated Party and
otherwise in the best interest of such Consolidated Party; and (ii) would not
materially impair the rights and benefits of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders under the Collateral Documents or any other Credit Document.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Consolidated Party shall undertake replacement
or restoration of any such Property having a net book value in excess of
$10,000,000 unless, after giving pro forma effect to any Funded Indebtedness to
be incurred in connection with such replacement or restoration, the Credit
Parties would be in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section
7.10(a) and Section 7.10(b) as of the most recent fiscal quarter end preceding
the date of determination with respect to which the Administrative Agent has
received

the Required Financial Information (assuming, for purposes hereof, that
such Funded Indebtedness was incurred as of the first day of the four
fiscal-quarter period ending as of such fiscal quarter end). All property damage
or casualty insurance proceeds shall be subject to the security interest of the
Administrative Agent (for the ratable benefit of the Lenders) under the
Collateral Documents. Pending final application of any Excess Proceeds, the
Credit Parties may apply such Excess Proceeds to temporarily reduce the
Revolving Loans or to make Permitted Investments.

         7.7. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
maintain and preserve its properties and equipment material to the conduct of
its business in good repair, working order and condition, normal wear and tear
and Involuntary Disposition excepted, and will make, or cause to be made, in
such properties and equipment from time to time all repairs, renewals,
replacements, extensions, additions, betterments and improvements thereto as may
reasonably be needed or proper, to the extent and in the manner customary for
companies in similar businesses and to the extent necessary in the reasonable
business judgment of such Person.

         7.8. USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans and will use the
Letters of Credit solely for the purposes set forth in Section 6.15.

         7.9. AUDITS/INSPECTIONS.

         Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, each Credit
Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit representatives
appointed by the Administrative Agent, including, without limitation,
independent accountants, agents, attorneys, and appraisers to visit and inspect
its property, including its books and records to the extent allowed by
applicable law and regulation, its accounts receivable and inventory, its
facilities and its other business assets, and to make photocopies thereof and to
write down and record any information such representative obtains and shall
permit the Administrative Agent or its representatives to investigate and verify
the accuracy of information provided to the Lenders and to discuss all such
matters with the officers, employees and representatives of such Person;
provided, however, that, unless an Event of Default shall exist, the
Administrative Agent shall not exercise its rights under this sentence more
often than two times during any calendar year and only one such time shall be at
the Credit Parties' expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no material
protected by an attorney-client privilege shall be required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Section 7.9; provided, however, that, in the event that any
Credit Party claims that any materials requested for review, investigation or
discussion by the Administrative Agent or any of its representatives pursuant to
this Section 7.9 is protected by an attorney-client privilege, then such Credit
Party shall (i) provide the Administrative Agent with a reasonably acceptable
basis for the assertion of the privilege, (ii) remove or redact only those
portions of the related materials deemed to be privileged and (iii) in good
faith cooperate with the Administrative Agent to determine a method by which the
information which the Administrative Agent deems necessary to review,

         corporate existence), 7.8, 7.10, 7.11 or 7.12 or Section 8; or

                 (ii) default in the due performance or observance by it of any
         term, covenant or agreement (other than those referred to in
         subsections (a), (b) or (c)(i) of this Section 9.1) contained in this
         Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document and such default shall
         continue unremedied for a period of at least 30 days after notice
         thereof by the Administrative Agent; or

             (d) OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS. Except as a result of or in connection
with a dissolution, merger or disposition of a Subsidiary not prohibited by

and effect (other than in accordance with its terms) or to give the
Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders the Liens, material rights, powers and
privileges purported to be created thereby, or any Credit Party shall so state
in writing; or

Person after the Closing Date in accordance with Section 7.11) or any provision
thereof shall cease to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor (including
any Person after the Closing Date in accordance with Section 7.11) hereunder or
any Person acting by or on behalf of such Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm such
Guarantor's obligations under such guaranty, or any Guarantor shall default
(beyond any applicable grace period) in the due performance or observance of any
term, covenant or agreement on its part to be performed or observed pursuant to
any guaranty; or

             (f) BANKRUPTCY, ETC. Any Bankruptcy Event shall occur with respect
to any Consolidated Party other than any non-Material Domestic Subsidiary; or

Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness outstanding under this Credit Agreement)
in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate principal amount for the Consolidated
Parties taken as a whole, (A) either (1) default in any payment shall occur and
continue (beyond the applicable grace period with respect thereto, if any) with
respect to any such Indebtedness (other than as a result of subordination
provisions invoked by the Lenders), or (2) a default in the observance or
performance relating to such Indebtedness or contained in any instrument or
agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event or
condition shall occur or exist, the effect of which default or other event or
condition is to cause, or permit, the holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or
trustee or agent on behalf of such holders) to cause, any such Indebtedness

                                                                             107


to become due prior to its stated maturity; or (B) any such Indebtedness shall
be declared due and payable, or required to be prepaid other than by a regularly

             (h) JUDGMENTS. One or more judgments or decrees shall be entered
against one or more of the Consolidated Parties involving a liability of

decrees shall not have been paid, vacated, discharged or stayed or bonded
pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof; or

             (i) ERISA. Any of the following events or conditions, if such event
or condition could reasonably be expected to result in liability that would have

term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or
not waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any lien shall arise on the
assets of any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate in favor of the PBGC or

result in the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA; (iii)

Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent,
likely to result in (A) the termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of

liability in connection with a withdrawal from, reorganization of (within the
meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or insolvency (within the meaning of Section

Indenture for the 11 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes (or comparable provisions in

against any holder of the applicable Subordinated Debt or Qualified Preferred
Stock (other than in accordance with their respective terms); or

         9.2. ACCELERATION; REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, upon the request
and direction of the Required Lenders, shall, by written notice to the Credit
Parties take any of the following actions:

         (a) TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. Declare the Commitments terminated
whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

         (b) ACCELERATION. Declare the Credit Party Obligations to be due and
payable, whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

         (c) CASH COLLATERAL. Direct the Borrower to pay (and the Borrower
hereby promises to pay, upon receipt of such notice) to the Administrative Agent
additional cash, to be held by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders, in a cash collateral account as additional security for the LOC
Obligations in respect of subsequent drawings under all then outstanding Letters
of Credit in an amount equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn
under all Letters of Credits then outstanding.

         (d) ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS. Enforce any and all rights and interests
created and existing under the Credit Documents including, without limitation,
all rights and remedies existing under the Collateral Documents, all rights and
remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of set-off.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in
Section 9.1(f) shall occur with respect to the Borrower, then, without the
giving of any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders,
(i) the Commitments automatically shall terminate, (ii) all of the outstanding
Credit Party Obligations automatically shall immediately become due and payable
and (iii) the Borrower automatically shall be obligated (and hereby promises) to
pay to the Administrative Agent additional cash, to be held by the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in a cash collateral
account as additional security for the LOC Obligations in respect of subsequent
drawings under all then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the
maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn under all Letters of Credits then
outstanding.

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

         10.1. APPOINTMENT, POWERS AND IMMUNITIES.

         (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as its agent under this Credit Agreement and the
other Credit Documents with such powers and discretion as are specifically
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Credit Agreement and
the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent (which term as used in this
sentence and







<Page>


                                                                             109


in Section 10.5 and the first sentence of Section 10.6 hereof shall include its
Affiliates and its own and its Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, and
agents): (i) shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth in this Credit Agreement and shall not be a trustee or
fiduciary for any Lender; (ii) shall not be responsible to the Lenders for any
recital, statement, representation, or warranty (whether written or oral) made
in or in connection with any Credit Document or any certificate or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, any
Credit Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability, or sufficiency of any Credit Document, or any other document
referred to or provided for therein or for any failure by any Credit Party or
any other Person to perform any of its obligations thereunder; (iii) shall not
be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify the
performance or observance of any covenants or agreements by any Credit Party or
the satisfaction of any condition or to inspect the Property (including the
books and records) of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates;
and (iv) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it under or in connection with any Credit Document, except to the extent that
the taking of such action or omission is found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute its own gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent may employ
agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care. The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with
respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated
therewith until such time (and except for so long) as the Administrative Agent
may agree at the request of the Required Lenders to act for the Issuing Lender
with respect thereto; provided, however, that the Issuing Lender shall have all
of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this
Section 10 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing
Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be
issued by it and the application and agreements for letters of credit pertaining
to the Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used
in this Section 10 included the Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or
omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the Issuing
Lender.

         10.2. RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
certification, notice, instrument, writing, or other communication (including,
without limitation, any thereof by telephone or telecopy) believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by or on behalf of the
proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including counsel for any Credit Party or Lender), independent accountants, and
other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
deem and treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an
Assignment and Acceptance executed in accordance with Section 11.3(b) hereof. As
to any matters not expressly provided for by this Credit Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take
any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding on all of the
Lenders; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required
to take any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability
or that is contrary to any Credit Document or applicable law or unless it shall
first be









<Page>


                                                                             110


indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking any such action.

         10.3. DEFAULTS.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or a Credit Party
specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a
notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, the Administrative
Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
shall (subject to Section 10.2 hereof) take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Required
Lenders (or such other Lenders as required by Section 11.6), provided THAT,
unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions,
the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action,
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

         10.4. RIGHTS AS A LENDER.

         With respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by it, JPMorgan Chase
Bank (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) in its capacity as a
Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the
context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. JPMorgan Chase Bank (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent)
and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Lender) accept
deposits from, lend money to, make investments in, provide services to, and
generally engage in any kind of lending, trust, or other business with any
Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as if it were not acting
as Administrative Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank (and any successor acting as
Administrative Agent) and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration
from any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for services in
connection with this Credit Agreement or otherwise without having to account for
the same to the Lenders.

         10.5. INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent
not reimbursed under Section 11.5 hereof, but without limiting the obligations
of the Credit Parties under such Section) ratably (in accordance with their
respective (i) Revolving Commitments (or, if the Revolving Commitments have been
terminated, the outstanding Revolving Loans and Participation Interests in
Letters of Credit (including the Participation Interests of the Issuing Lender
in Letters of Credit)) and (ii) outstanding Tranche B Term Loans (and
Participation Interests therein)) for, and hold the Administrative Agent
harmless from and against, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' fees), or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (including
by any Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit Document or
the transactions contemplated









<Page>


                                                                             111


thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under any
Credit Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly
upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or expenses payable by the Credit
Parties under Section 11.5, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not
promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Credit Parties. The
agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination
of the Commitments hereunder.

         10.6. NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries and decision to enter into this Credit
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit
Documents. Except for notices, reports, and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition, or business of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates.

         10.7. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 90 days prior
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Credit Parties. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right with the consent of the Borrower (not
to be unreasonably withheld) to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no
successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after
the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws
of the United States having combined capital and surplus of at least
$100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Section 10 shall continue in effect for its benefit in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
Administrative Agent. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days
following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become

                                                                             112


effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

         10.8. SYNDICATION AGENT.

         The Syndication Agent, in its capacity as such, shall have no rights,
powers, duties, liabilities, fiduciary relationships or obligations under this
Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

         10.9. CO-DOCUMENTATION AGENTS.

         The Co-Documentation Agents, in their capacity as such, shall have no
rights, powers, duties, liabilities, fiduciary relationships or obligations
under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents.

                                   SECTION XI

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default
under Section 9.1(a), each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, other than payroll or trust accounts) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender (or any of its
Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any
and all of the obligations of such Person then due and owing under this Credit
Agreement or under any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether such
Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder. Each Lender agrees
promptly to notify in writing any affected Credit Party after any such set-off
and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The
rights of each Lender under this Section 11.2 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such
Lender may have.

         11.3. BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT.

         (a) The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that
issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in
accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants
(to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent
expressly contemplated

hereby, the Indemnified Parties) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.

         (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below,
any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                  (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower
     shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender
     or an Approved Fund; and

                  (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the
     Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee
     that is a Lender, Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund immediately
     prior to giving effect to such assignment.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
     conditions:

                  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, Affiliate
     of a Lender, an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining
     amount of the assigning Lender's and its Affiliates' or Approved Funds'
     Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to
     each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
     Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
     Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of
     Revolving Commitments and $1,000,000 in the case of Tranche B Term Loans
     unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent;

                  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
     a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement in respect of the applicable class of Commitments or
     Loans; provided that this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit
     assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
     obligations in respect of one class of Commitments or Loans;

                  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
     to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

                  (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
     to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire; and

                  (E) in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a CLO managed
     by such Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender, unless such assignment (or
     an assignment to a CLO managed by such Lender or an Affiliate of such
     Lender) shall have been approved by the Borrower (the Borrower agreeing
     that such an approval, if requested, will not be








<Page>


                                                                             116


     unreasonably withheld or delayed), the assigning Lender shall retain the
     sole right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
     provision of this Agreement, provided that the Assignment and Acceptance
     between such Lender and such CLO may provide that such Lender will not,
     without the consent of such CLO, agree to any amendment, modification or
     waiver described in the first proviso to Section 11.6(a) that affects such
     CLO.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
     paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
     specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall
     be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
     Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
     under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
     extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be
     released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
     Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
     obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
     hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9,
     3.11, 3.12 and 11.5 for matters arising while such person was a Lender). If
     the assignee is not a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the
     Code, it shall deliver to the Credit Parties and the Administrative Agent
     certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of Taxes. Any
     assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
     Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.3 shall be treated for
     purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
     such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this
     Section.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
     agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
     Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
     recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment
     of, and principal amount of the Loans and LOC Obligations owing to, each
     Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The
     entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
     Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each
     Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
     as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding
     notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by
     the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and
     from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
     Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
     completed administrative questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already
     be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in
     paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
     required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall
     accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained
     therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of
     this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in
     this paragraph.

                                                                             117


                  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower,
     the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, sell
     participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
     all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
     Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans
     owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Credit
     Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
     responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
     obligations and (C) the Consolidated Parties, the Administrative Agent, the
     Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
     directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
     obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
     pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that
     such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Credit Documents and
     to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the
     Credit Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
     that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to
     any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
     Section 11.6(A) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii)
     of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
     entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 to the same extent
     as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant
     to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
     Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as
     though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
     Section 3.14 as though it were a Lender.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
     greater payment under Sections 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 than the applicable
     Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
     participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
     participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written
     consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender
     shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.11 unless the Borrower
     is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
     Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
     3.11(d) as though it were a Lender.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
     interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement
     (i) to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank as
     collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular
     issued by such Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to
     any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such
     pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any
     of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
     such Lender as a party hereto, (ii) in the case of any Lender which has
     made Tranche B Term Loans and is an investment fund, to the trustee under
     the indenture to which such fund is a party in support of its obligations
     to such trustee for the benefit of the applicable trust beneficiaries and
     (iii) to appropriate entities within the Farm Credit System, as collateral
     security.

                  (e) Any Lender may furnish any information concerning the
     Consolidated Parties in the possession of such Lender from time to time to
     assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and
     participants), subject, however, to the provisions of Section 11.14 hereof.

         11.4. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Administrative Agent or any
Lender and any of the Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or
thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5. EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a) The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to pay on demand all
reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the
syndication, preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and
amendment of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, and the other
documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent with
respect thereto and with respect to advising the Administrative Agent as to its
rights and responsibilities under the Credit Documents. The Credit Parties
further jointly and severally agree to pay on demand all reasonable costs and
expenses of the Administrative Agent and one counsel to all of the Lenders, if
any, in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings, or otherwise) of the Credit Documents and the other documents to be
delivered hereunder, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability,
cost, or expense results from the gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misconduct of the Person seeking reimbursement or a breach by such Person of its
obligations hereunder.

         The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each of their Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees and agents (each,
an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all claims, damages, actual
losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees of the Administrative Agent and, except as provided
below, one counsel to all of the Lenders and excluding taxes) that may be
incurred by or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out
of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in
connection with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding or preparation of
defense in connection therewith) the Credit Documents, any of the transactions
contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans,
except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense
results from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates or any their respective officers,
directors, trustees, employees or agents) or from a breach by such Indemnified
Party (or any of its Affiliates or any their respective officers, directors,
trustees, employees or agents) of its obligations hereunder. In the case of an
investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this
Section 11.5 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any of the








<Page>


                                                                             119


Credit Parties, their respective directors, shareholders or creditors or an
Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a
party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated. No party hereto shall assert any claim against any other party
hereto, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, trustees,
officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out
of or otherwise relating to the Credit Documents, any of the transactions
contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.
The Borrower shall be entitled to assume the defense of any action for which
indemnification is sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder with counsel of the
Borrower's choice at its expense (in which case the Borrower shall not
thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel
retained by an Indemnified Person except as set forth below); provided, however,
that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the election by the Borrower to assume the defense of any such
action, each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and to participate in the defense of such action, and the Borrower shall bear
the reasonable fees, costs, and expenses of such separate counsel, if (i) the
use of counsel chosen by the Borrower to represent such Indemnified Party would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential
defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the Borrower and such
Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or
additional to those available to the Borrower (in which case the Borrower shall
not have the right to assume the defense or such action on behalf of such
Indemnified Party); (iii) the Borrower shall not have employed counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to represent it within a
reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the
Borrower shall authorize such Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at
the Borrower's expense.

         (b) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit Parties
contained in this Section 11.5 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC
Obligations and other Credit Party Obligations and the termination of the
Commitments hereunder.

         11.6. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

         Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any of
the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in
writing entered into by, or approved in writing by, each of the Credit Parties
party thereto and the Required Lenders, provided, however, that:

         (a) without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby,
neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document may be amended,
changed, waived, discharged or terminated so as to

                  (i) extend any Commitment or the final maturity of any Loan or
     of any reimbursement obligation, or any portion thereof, arising from
     drawings under Letters of Credit, or extend or waive any Principal
     Amortization Payment of any Loan, or any portion thereof,

                                                                             120


                  (ii) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
     on any Loan or of any reimbursement obligation, or any portion thereof,
     arising from drawings under Letters of Credit (other than as a result of
     waiving the applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates)
     or of any Fees,

                  (iii) reduce or waive the principal amount of any Loan or of
     any reimbursement obligation, or any portion thereof, arising from drawings
     under Letters of Credit,

                  (iv) increase the Commitment of a Lender over the amount
     thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any
     condition precedent set forth in Section 5.2 or of any Default or Event of
     Default or mandatory reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute a
     change in the terms of any Commitment of any Lender),

                  (v) except as the result of or in connection with an Asset
     Disposition not prohibited by Section 8.5, release all or substantially all
     of the Collateral,

                  (vi) except as the result of or in connection with a
     dissolution, merger or disposition of a Consolidated Party not prohibited
     by Section 8.4 or Section 8.5, release the Borrower or substantially all of
     the other Credit Parties from its or their obligations under the Credit
     Documents,

                  (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section
     11.6 or Section 3.13(a),

                  (viii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of
     Required Lenders, or

                  (ix) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower or
     all or substantially all of the other Credit Parties of any of its or their
     rights and obligations under (or in respect of) the Credit Documents except
     as permitted hereby or thereby;

         (b) without the consent of Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders)
holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the outstanding Tranche B Term
Loans (and Participation Interests therein), Section 3.3(b)(vi) may not be
amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated so as to extend the time for
or change the amount or the manner of application of proceeds of any mandatory
prepayment required by Section 3.3(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) hereof;

         (c) without the consent of the Administrative Agent, no provision of
Section 10 may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated;

         (d) without the consent of the Issuing Lender, no provision of Section
2.2 may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated;

         (e) without the consent of the Swingline Lender, no provision of
Section 2.3 may be amended; and

                                                                             121


         (f) without the consent of Lenders holding in the aggregate at least
two-thirds of (i) the aggregate Revolving Commitments and the outstanding
Tranche B Loans or (ii) if all of the Revolving Commitments have been
terminated, the outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations (including, without
limitation, Participation Interests), amend this Section 11.6 to impose any
greater restriction on the ability of any Lender to assign any of its rights and
obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is required in
certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is entitled to vote as
such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the
Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein
and (y) the Required Lenders shall determine whether or not to allow a Credit
Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding and such determination shall be binding on all of the Lenders.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Credit Agreement may be amended (or
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to add one or more additional credit
facilities to this Credit Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from
time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect
thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Credit Agreement and the other
Credit Documents with the Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans and the
accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately
the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required
Lenders.

         In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Credit Agreement may
be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower
and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans (as defined below)
to permit the refinancing of all outstanding Tranche B Term Loans ("Refinanced
Term Loans") with a replacement "B" or "C" term loan tranche hereunder
("Replacement Term Loans"), provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of
such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of
such Refinanced Term Loans, (b) the weighted average life to maturity of such
Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the weighted average life to
maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such refinancing and (c)
all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially
identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term
Loans than, those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent
necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period
after the latest final maturity of the Refinanced Term Loans in effect
immediately prior to such refinancing.

         11.7. COUNTERPARTS.

         This Credit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in making
proof of this Credit Agreement to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart for each of the parties hereto. Delivery by facsimile by any of the
parties hereto of an executed counterpart of this Credit Agreement shall be as

representation that an original executed counterpart hereof will be delivered.

         11.8. HEADINGS.

         The headings of the sections hereof are provided for convenience only

this Credit Agreement.

         11.9. SURVIVAL.

         All indemnities set forth herein, including, without limitation, in
Section 2.2(i), 3.11, 3.12, 10.5 or 11.5 shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Credit Agreement, the making of the Loans, the issuance of the
Letters of Credit, the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations and other
obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments
hereunder, and all representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties

         11.10. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

         (a) THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
THEREIN, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Any legal
action or proceeding with respect to this Credit Agreement or any other Credit
Document may be brought in the courts of the State of New York in New York
County, or of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and, by
execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement, each of the Credit Parties
hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each of the

         11.15. SOURCE OF FUNDS.

         (a) no part of such funds constitutes assets allocated to any separate
account maintained by such Lender in which any employee benefit plan (or its
related trust) has any interest;

         (b) to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes assets
allocated to any separate account maintained by such Lender, such Lender has
disclosed to the Borrower the name of each employee benefit plan whose assets in
such account exceed 10% of the total assets of such account as of the date of
such purchase (and, for purposes of this clause (b), all employee benefit plans
maintained by the same employer or employee organization are deemed to be a
single plan);

         (c) to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes assets of an
insurance company's general account, such insurance company has complied with
all of the requirements of the regulations issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of
ERISA; or

         (d) such funds constitute assets of one or more specific benefit plans
which such Lender has identified in writing to the Borrower.

account" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3
of ERISA.

         11.16. REGULATION D.

it is a commercial lender, other financial institution or other "accredited"
investor (as defined in SEC Regulation D) which makes or acquires or loans in
the ordinary course of business and that it will make or acquire Loans for its
own account in the ordinary course of business.
