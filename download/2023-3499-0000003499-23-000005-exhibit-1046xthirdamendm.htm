In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) for purposes of the IBA setting LIBOR. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, LIBOR may no longer be available or deemed an appropriate 44 </FONT></DIV>

In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or Early Opt-In Election, Section 2.7(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 2.7(d) of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate of Eurodollar Borrowings is based.

Each party&#8217;s obligations under this Section 2.12 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 2.13 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (1) Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under Section 2.8, 2.9 or 2.12, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to Administrative Agent at its offices at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 201 North Central Avenue, Floor 14, Phoenix, Arizona 85004, Attn: Loan Servicing, Telecopy No. (602) 221-1116, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.12, 9.5 and 12.5 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable to the next succeeding Business Day. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. (2) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. (3) Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate reasonably determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. (4) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.2(2), 2.13(3) or 14.13, then Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 54 </FONT></DIV>

Borrower&#8217;s assets do not and, immediately following the making of the Loans will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted.  Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur Debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such Debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower). Section 7.12 Full and Accurate Disclosure. No statement of fact made by or on behalf of Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate, statement or questionnaire delivered by Borrower in connection with the Loans contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements contained herein or therein not misleading.

(4) Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Agreement, any modification or supplement of Article 14, or of any of the rights or duties of Administrative Agent hereunder shall require the consent of Administrative Agent. Section 12.3 Limitation on Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto to conform strictly to applicable usury laws. Accordingly, all agreements between Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the Loans are hereby expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender or charged by any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the money to be lent hereunder or otherwise, exceed the maximum amount allowed by law.  If the Loans would be usurious under applicable law (including the laws of the State and the laws of the United States of America), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Loan Documents: (1) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received under the Loan Documents shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law, and any excess shall be credited on the Notes by the holders thereof (or, if the Notes have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower); and (2) if maturity is accelerated by reason of an election by Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, or in the event of any prepayment, then any consideration which constitutes interest may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law.  In such case, excess interest, if any, provided for in the Loan Documents or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread from the date of advance until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform through the term hereof.  If such amortization, proration, allocation and spreading is not permitted under applicable law, then such excess interest shall be cancelled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the Notes (or, if the Notes have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms and provisions of this Section 12.3 shall control and supersede every other provision of the Loan Documents.  The Loan Documents are contracts made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State, except that if at any time the laws of the United States of America permit the Lenders to contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the laws of the State (whether such federal laws directly so provide or refer to the law of any state), then such federal laws shall to such extent govern as to the rate of interest which the Lenders may contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive under the Loan Documents. 111 </FONT></DIV>

(1) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each of the Lenders is, subject (as between the Lenders) to the provisions of subsection (3) of this Section 12.25, hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held, and other indebtedness at any time owing, by such Lender in any of its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, to or for the credit or the account of Borrower (but specifically excluding Guarantor or any other Affiliate of Borrower) against any and all of the respective obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or any other Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured and such deposits or indebtedness may be unmatured.  Each Lender hereby acknowledges that the exercise by any Lender of offset, set-off, banker&#8217;s lien, or similar rights against any deposit or other indebtedness of Borrower whether or not located in California or any other state with certain laws restricting lenders from pursuing multiple collection methods, could result under such laws in significant impairment of the ability of all the Lenders to recover any further amounts in respect of the Loan. Therefore, each Lender agrees that no Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off, banker&#8217;s lien, or otherwise, against any assets of Borrower (including all general or special, time or demand, provisional or other deposits and other indebtedness owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower) without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders. (2) Each Lender shall promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.  The rights of the Lenders under this Section 12.25 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which the Lenders may have. (3) If an Event of Default has resulted in the Loans becoming due and payable prior to the stated maturity thereof, each Lender agrees that it shall turn over to Administrative Agent any payment (whether voluntary or involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise) on account of the Loans held by it in excess of its ratable portion of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Lenders.

No such obligation or liability shall be personally binding upon, nor shall resort for the enforcement thereof be had to, the property of any of Administrative Agent&#8217;s or any Lender&#8217;s shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents, regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract, tort or otherwise. 121 </FONT></DIV>

If a Lender fails to fund its portion of any Borrowing, in whole or part, within three (3) Business Days after the date required hereunder and Administrative Agent shall not have funded the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s portion of the Borrowing under Section 2.2(2), Administrative Agent shall so notify the Lenders, and within three (3) Business Days after delivery of such notice, the Non-Defaulting Lenders shall have the right, but not the obligation, in their respective, sole and absolute discretion, to fund all or a portion of such deficiency (the amount so funded by any such Non-Defaulting Lenders being referred to herein as a &#8220;Special Advance&#8221;) to Borrower.  In such event, the Defaulting Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent for payment to the Non-Defaulting Lenders making the Special Advance, forthwith on demand such amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Defaulting Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by Administrative 129 </FONT></DIV>

Upon any such purchase of the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Future Commitment, the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s share in future Loans and its rights under the Loan Documents with respect thereto shall terminate on the date of purchase, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest and the Non-Defaulting Lenders acquiring such rights shall be obligated to fund the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s Future Commitment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

The Required Lenders may, upon notice to the Defaulting Lender and Administrative Agent, require the Defaulting Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.23) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Defaulting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); and (ii) Administrative Agent shall have received payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent or the other Lenders under this Agreement.  The Defaulting Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender. (ii) By Borrower.  If the Lender has become a Defaulting Lender due to a failure to fund its Loans hereunder, Borrower may at its option replace Defaulting Lender under Section 2.14(2). (f) Indemnification.  Each Defaulting Lender shall indemnify Administrative Agent, each Non-Defaulting Lender and Borrower from and against any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent, any Non-Defaulting Lender or Borrower with respect to the Loan Documents in any way relating to or arising out of such Lender&#8217;s status as a Defaulting Lender. The obligations of the Defaulting Lender under this clause (f) shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness, the termination of this Agreement and the Defaulting Lender&#8217;s reversion to a Non-Defaulting Lender under subsection (g) of this Section 14.11. 130 </FONT></DIV>

Except for the provisions of this Article 14 which expressly grant Borrower any rights, the provisions of this Article 14 are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights to rely on, enforce or consent to any waiver, modification or amendment of, any of the provisions hereof; provided, however, that Borrower (a) acknowledges and agrees to the limitations set forth in Section 12.2(1) on Administrative Agent&#8217;s ability to act unilaterally with respect to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and (b) agrees that Administrative Agent&#8217;s inability to deliver any consent to, or approval of, an action requested by Borrower due to lack of appropriate Lender consent where Lender consent is required in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.2(1) shall not constitute an unreasonable withholding or delay by Administrative Agent in the giving of such consent or approval.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall be entitled to rely on consents and approvals executed by Administrative Agent without investigation as to the existence of proper Lender authorization. Section 14.13 Indemnification by the Lenders. The Lenders agree to indemnify Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.5, but without limiting the obligations of Borrower under Section 12.5) ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by the Lenders (or, if no Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments), for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent (including by any Lender) arising out of or by reason of any investigation in or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses that Borrower is obligated to pay under Section 12.5, but excluding, unless a Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents. 131 </FONT></DIV>
