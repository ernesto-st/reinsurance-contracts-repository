information. While we do not believe that this non-public information is required to be publicly
disclosed by the Company under the applicable securities laws, that information does modify,
qualify and create exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Securities
Purchase Agreement. In addition, these representations and warranties were made as of the date of

and warranties may have changed since the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, which
subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the Company.
Moreover, representations and warranties are frequently utilized in Securities Purchase Agreements
as a means of allocating risks, both known and unknown, rather than to make affirmative factual
claims or statements. Accordingly, ONLY THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT SHOULD RELY ON THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS CURRENT CHARACTERIZATIONS OF FACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE
COMPANY OR THE PURCHASERS.
