         this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
         specified below:

                           "ABR", when used in reference to any Loan or
         Borrowing, refers to whether such Loan, or the Loans comprising such
         Borrowing, are bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to
         the Alternate Base Rate.

                           "Acquired Assets" means (a) with respect to any
         fiscal year, the consolidated tangible assets acquired pursuant to a
         Permitted Acquisition during such fiscal year determined in accordance
         with GAAP (the "Specified Amount"), provided that if such Permitted
         Acquisition is not consummated during the first quarter of such fiscal
         year, Acquired Assets shall be determined for purposes of this clause
         (a) by multiplying the Specified Amount by (i) .75 if such Permitted
         Acquisition is consummated during the second quarter of such fiscal
         year, (ii) .50 if such Permitted Acquisition is consummated during the
         third quarter of such fiscal year and (iii) .25 if such Permitted
         Acquisition is consummated during the fourth quarter of such fiscal
         year and (b) with respect to any fiscal year thereafter, the Specified
         Amount.

                           "Acquisition Lease Financing" means any sale or
         transfer by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Specified
         Acquired Property that is rented or leased by the Parent Borrower or
         such Subsidiary so long as (a) the proceeds from such transaction
         consist solely of cash, (b) such transaction is consummated within 90
         days after the completion of the applicable Permitted Acquisition and

         contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of May 17, 2002
         among Holdings, the Parent Borrower and Heartland Industrial Partners,
         L.P. and the related documentation.

                           "Type", when used in reference to any Loan or
         Borrowing, refers to whether the rate of interest on such Loan, or on
         the Loans comprising such Borrowing, is determined by reference to the
         Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate.

                           "Withdrawal Liability" means liability to a
         Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from
         such Multiemployer Plan, as such terms are defined in Part I of
         Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.

                           SECTION 1.02. Classification of Loans and Borrowings.
         For purposes of this Agreement, Loans may be classified and referred to
         by Class (e.g., a "Revolving Loan") or by Type (e.g., a "Eurocurrency
         Loan") or by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurocurrency Revolving Loan").
         Borrowings also may be classified and referred to by Class (e.g., a
         "Revolving Borrowing") or by Type (e.g., a "Eurocurrency Borrowing") or
         by Class and Type (e.g., a "Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing").

                           SECTION 1.03. Terms Generally. The definitions of
         terms herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of
         the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall
         include the corresponding mascu line, feminine and neuter forms. The
         words "include",

                                                                              53


         "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase
         "without limitation". The word "will" shall be construed to have the
         same meaning and effect as the word "shall". Unless the context
         requires otherwise (a) any definition of or reference to any agreement,
         instrument or other document herein shall be construed as referring to
         such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time
         amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any
         restrictions on such amendments, supplements or modifications set forth
         herein), (b) any reference herein to any Person shall be construed to
         include such Person's successors and assigns, (c) the words "herein",
         "hereof" and "hereunder", and words of similar import, shall be
         construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any
         particular provision hereof, (d) all references herein to Articles,
         Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be construed to refer to
         Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement
         and (e) the words "asset" and "property" shall be construed to have the
         same meaning and effect and to refer to any and all tangible and
         intangible assets and properties, including cash, securities, accounts
         and contract rights.

                           SECTION 1.04. Accounting Terms; GAAP. Except as
         otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or
         financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in
         effect from time to time; provided that, if the Parent Borrower
         notifies the Administrative Agent that the Parent Borrower requests an
         amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change
         occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof
         on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent
         notifies the Parent Borrower that the Required Lenders request an
         amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of
         whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or
         in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on
         the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such
         change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been
         withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith.

                           SECTION 1.05. Exchange Rates. (a) Not later than 1:00
         p.m., New York City time, on each Calculation Date beginning with the
         date on which the initial Foreign Currency Borrowing is made or the
         initial Foreign Currency Letter of Credit is issued, the Administrative
         Agent shall (i) determine the Exchange Rate as of such Calculation Date
         with respect to each Foreign Currency and (ii) give notice thereof to
         the Revolving Lenders and the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers). The

                                                                              54


         Exchange Rates so determined shall become effective on the first
         Business Day immediately following the relevant Calculation Date (a
         "Recalculation Date"), shall remain effective until the next succeeding
         Recalculation Date, and shall for all purposes of this Agreement (other
         than Section 9.01, Section 10.14 or any other provision expressly
         requiring the use of a current Exchange Rate) be the Exchange Rates
         employed in converting any amounts between dollars and Foreign
         Currencies.

                           (b) Not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
         each Recalculation Date and each date on which Revolving Loans
         denominated in any Foreign Currency are made, the Administrative Agent
         shall (i) determine the aggregate amount of the Dollar Equivalents of
         (A) the principal amounts of the Foreign Currency Loans then
         outstanding (after giving effect to any Foreign Currency Loans made or
         repaid on such date) (B) the face value of outstanding Foreign Currency
         Letters of Credit and (C) unreimbursed drawings in respect of Foreign
         Currency Letters of Credit and (ii) notify the Revolving Lenders and
         the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers) of the results of such determination.

                           SECTION 1.06. Redenomination of Certain Foreign
         Currencies. (a) Each obligation of any party to this Agreement to make
         a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state
         of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after
         the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such
         adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation). If, in relation to
         the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest
         expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be
         inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London Interbank
         Market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro,
         such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice
         with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as
         its lawful currency; provided that if any Foreign Currency Borrowing in
         the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to
         such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such
         Foreign Currency Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest
         Period.

                           (b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject
         to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent
         may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption
         of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant
         market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

                                   The Credits

                           SECTION 2.01. Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms
         and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees (i) to make a
         Tranche D Term Loan to the Parent Borrower on the Effective Date in a
         principal amount not exceeding its Tranche D Commitment and (ii) to
         make Revolving Loans to the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers, as the case may be, from time to time during the Revolving
         Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not
         result in such Lender's (A) Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender's
         Revolving Commitment or (B) Foreign Currency Exposure exceeding such
         Lender's Foreign Currency Commitment.

                           (b) Within the foregoing limits and subject to the
         terms and conditions set forth herein, the Parent Borrower and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case may be, may borrow, prepay
         and reborrow Revolving Loans. Amounts repaid in respect of Term Loans
         may not be reborrowed.

                           SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan
         (other than a Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing
         consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders
         ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the
         applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required
         to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations
         hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and
         no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make
         Loans as required.

                           (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing
         (other than Foreign Currency Borrowings) and Term Borrowing shall be
         comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the Parent
         Borrower may request in accordance herewith; provided that all
         Borrowings made on the Effective Date must be made as ABR Borrowings.
         All Foreign Currency Borrowings shall be comprised entirely of
         Eurocurrency Loans. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each
         Lender at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any
         domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
         Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the
         obligation of any Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the
         terms of this Agreement.

                           (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for
         any Eurocurrency Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
         amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or 1,000,000 units
         of the applicable Foreign Currency) and not less than $5,000,000 (or
         5,000,000 units in the applicable Foreign Currency. At the time that
         each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an
         aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not
         less than $5,000,000; provided that (i) an ABR Revolving Borrowing may
         be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of
         the total Revolving Commitments and (ii) an ABR Revolving Borrowing or
         a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, in the case of Foreign Currency
         Letters of Credit, may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the
         amount that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC
         Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each Swingline Loan
         shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not
         less than $500,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be
         outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time
         be more than a total of 12 Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding.

                           (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
         Agreement, none of the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
         continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect
         thereto would end after the Revolving Maturity Date or the Tranche D
         Maturity Date, as applicable.

                           SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a
         Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing, the Parent Borrower or, in the
         case of a Foreign Currency Borrowing, the applicable Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by
         telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than
         12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of
         the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not
         later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, one Business Day before the
         date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of an ABR
         Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement
         as contemplated by Section 2.05(e) may be given not later than 10:00
         a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each
         such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be
         confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative
         Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the
         Administrative Agent and signed by the Parent Borrower and, in the case
         of a Foreign Currency Borrowing, the applicable Foreign

                                                                              57


         Subsidiary Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request
         shall specify the following information in compliance with Section
         2.02:

                           (i) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a
                  Revolving Borrowing or a Tranche D Term Borrowing;

                           (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

                           (iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
                  Business Day;

                           (iv) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
                  or a Eurocurrency Borrowing, unless such Borrowing is a
                  Foreign Currency Borrowing;

                           (v) if such Borrowing is a Foreign Currency
                  Borrowing, the relevant Foreign Currency;

                           (vi) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the
                  initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall
                  be a period contemplated by the definition of the term
                  "Interest Period"; and

                           (vii) the location and number of the Parent
                  Borrower's or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower's, as
                  the case may be, account to which funds are to be disbursed,
                  which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06.

         If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the
         requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing, unless such Borrowing is
         a Foreign Currency Borrowing, in which case such Borrowing shall be a
         Eurocurrency Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect
         to any requested Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, then the Parent
         Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
         month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in
         accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise
         each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's
         Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

                           SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the
         terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to
         make Swingline Loans to the Parent Borrower from time to time during
         the Revolving Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at
         any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate
         principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $30,000,000
         or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Exposures exceeding the


<PAGE>
                                                                              58


         total Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall
         not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding
         Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms
         and conditions set forth herein, the Parent Borrower may borrow, prepay
         and reborrow Swingline Loans.

                           (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Parent Borrower
         shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone
         (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
         on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be
         irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a
         Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The
         Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any
         such notice received from the Parent Borrower. The Swingline Lender
         shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Parent Borrower by
         means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Parent Borrower
         with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to
         finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
         2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City
         time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

                           (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given
         to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
         time, on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire
         participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the
         Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate
         amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate.
         Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will
         give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice
         such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.
         Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees,
         upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative
         Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's
         Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving
         Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
         participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is
         absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
         circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a
         Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each
         such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
         or reduction whatsoever (provided that such payment shall not cause
         such Lender's Revolving Exposure to exceed such Lender's Revolving
         Commitment). Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation
         under this paragraph


<PAGE>
                                                                              59


         by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as
         provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and
         Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations
         of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
         pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
         Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent
         Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant
         to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline
         Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline
         Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Parent
         Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Parent Borrower) in respect
         of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the
         proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted
         to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
         Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative
         Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments
         pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their
         interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline
         Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Parent Borrower
         of any default in the payment thereof.

                           SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject
         to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Parent Borrower may
         request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account or the
         account of a Subsidiary and any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower may request
         the issuance of Foreign Currency Letters of Credit for its own account
         or the account of a Subsidiary of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, in
         each case in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent
         and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the
         Revolving Availability Period (provided that the Parent Borrower or a
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall be a co-
         applicant with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for the account
         of or in favor of a Subsidiary that is not a Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower). In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
         of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
         Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be,

         Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an
         outstanding Letter of Credit), the Parent Borrower or the applicable
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall hand deliver or
         telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for
         doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank
         and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested
         date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting
         the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit
         to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of
         issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business
         Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall
         comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter
         of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such
         other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or
         extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the
         Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the
         case may be, also shall submit a letter of credit application on the
         Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a
         Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed
         or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
         of each Letter of Credit the Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall be deemed to represent
         and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
         renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000,
         (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving
         Commitments and (iii) the total Foreign Currency Exposures shall not
         exceed the total Foreign Currency Commitments.

                           (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall
         expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the
         date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit
         (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after
         such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days
         prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

                           (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of
         Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount
         thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank
         or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving
         Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
         Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's
         Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn
         under such Letter of Credit. In


<PAGE>
                                                                              61


         consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving
         Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
         Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such
         Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the
         Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Parent Borrower or the
         applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, on the date
         due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
         reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Parent Borrower or
         the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, for any
         reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
         acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters
         of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
         any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
         extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of
         a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each
         such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
         or reduction whatsoever.

                           (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any
         LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Parent Borrower
         or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be,
         shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative
         Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00
         noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is
         made, if the Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower, as the case may be, shall have received notice of such LC
         Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time or London time (in
         the case of Foreign Currency Letters of Credit), on such date, or, if
         such notice has not been received by the Parent Borrower or the
         applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, prior to
         such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
         time or London time (in the case of Foreign Currency Letters of
         Credit), on (i) the Business Day that the Parent Borrower or the
         applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, receives
         such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York
         City time or London time (in the case of Foreign Currency Letters of
         Credit), on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately
         following the day that the Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, receives such notice, if such
         notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
         provided that (i) the Parent Borrower may, subject to the conditions to
         borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or
         2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or
         Swingline Loan in an equivalent


<PAGE>
                                                                              62


         amount and, to the extent so financed, the Parent Borrower's obligation
         to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting
         ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan and (ii) such Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set
         forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment
         be financed with a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent
         amount in the applicable Foreign Currency and, to the extent so
         financed, such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower's obligation to make such
         payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Eurocurrency
         Revolving Borrowing. If the Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, fails to make such payment
         when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender
         of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may
         be, in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.
         Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall
         pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the
         unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same manner as provided in Section
         2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall
         apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving
         Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
         Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.
         Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment
         from the Parent Borrower or any applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower,
         as the case may be, pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative
         Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the
         extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
         paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the
         Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a
         Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing
         Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving
         Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a
         Loan and shall not relieve the Parent Borrower or any applicable
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, of its obligation to
         reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                           (f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the
         Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to reimburse LC
         Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
         absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
         strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and
         all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of
         validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this


<PAGE>
                                                                              63


         Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other
         document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
         fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank
         under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
         document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit,
         or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
         similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of
         this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide
         a right of setoff against, the obligations of the Parent Borrower or
         any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereunder. Neither the Administrative
         Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related
         Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
         connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any
         payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any
         of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any
         error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or
         delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating
         to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
         drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or
         any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing
         Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
         Issuing Bank from liability to the Parent Borrower or any applicable
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, to the extent of any
         direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect
         of which are hereby waived by the Parent Borrower or any applicable
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Parent Borrower or any
         applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, that are
         caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
         whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit
         comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
         in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of
         the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care
         in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without
         limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect
         to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial
         compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may,
         in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such
         documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless
         of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
         make


<PAGE>
                                                                              64


         payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
         compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                           (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall,
         promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
         purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.
         The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the
         Parent Borrower or any applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the
         case may be, by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for
         payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC
         Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in
         giving such notice shall not relieve the Parent Borrower or any
         applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, of its
         obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with
         respect to any such LC Disbursement (other than with respect to the
         timing of such reimbursement obligation set forth in Section 2.05(e)).

                           (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make
         any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Parent Borrower or any applicable
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall reimburse such
         LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the
         unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and
         including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the
         date that the Parent Borrower or any applicable Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower, as the case may be, reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the
         rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that,
         if the Parent Borrower or any applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower,
         as the case may be, fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
         pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall
         apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the
         account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after
         the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e)
         of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account
         of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                           (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank; Additional
         Issuing Banks. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written
         agreement among the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers), the Administrative Agent, the replaced
         Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. One or more Lenders may be
         appointed as additional Issuing Banks by written agreement among the
         Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers), the Administrative Agent (whose consent will not be
         unreasonably withheld) and the


<PAGE>
                                                                              65


         Lender that is to be so appointed. The Administrative Agent shall
         notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank or any
         such additional Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall
         become effective, the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the
         account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From
         and after the effective date of any such replacement or addition, as
         applicable, (i) the successor or additional Issuing Bank shall have all
         the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement
         with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii)
         references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer
         to such successor or such addition or to any previous Issuing Bank, or
         to such successor or such addition and all previous Issuing Banks, as
         the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank
         hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and
         shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
         Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by
         it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue
         additional Letters of Credit. If at any time there is more than one
         Issuing Bank hereunder, the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) may, in its discretion, select which
         Issuing Bank is to issue any particular Letter of Credit.

                           (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default
         shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Parent
         Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower receives notice from the
         Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of
         the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure
         representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the
         deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent
         Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case may be,
         shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name
         of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an
         amount in cash in the applicable currency equal to the LC Exposure as
         of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided
         that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become
         effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due
         and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the
         occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Parent Borrower
         or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
         Article VII. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative
         Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations
         of the Parent Borrower and


<PAGE>
                                                                              66


         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement. The
         Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
         including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other
         than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which
         investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
         Administrative Agent and at the risk and expense of the Parent Borrower
         and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, such deposits shall not bear
         interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
         accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by
         the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
         Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent
         not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
         obligations of the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has
         been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with
         LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be
         applied to satisfy other obligations of the Parent Borrower and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement. If the Parent
         Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is required to provide an
         amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an
         Event of Default, such amount plus any accrued interest or realized
         profits of such amounts (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
         be returned to the Parent Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
         or waived. If the Parent Borrower is required to provide an amount of
         such collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(b), such amount plus
         any accrued interest or realized profits on account of such amount (to
         the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Parent
         Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return,
         the Parent Borrower would remain in compliance with Section 2.11(b) and
         no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                           SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender
         shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date
         thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon,
         New York City time, or in the case of Foreign Currency Borrowings,
         London time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
         designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided
         that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The
         Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may
         be, by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an

<PAGE>
                                                                              67


         account of the Parent Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as
         the case may be, maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
         City, or in the case of Foreign Currency Borrowings, London, and
         designated by the Parent Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower,
         in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans
         made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
         Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the
         Issuing Bank.

                           (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
         received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any
         Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the
         Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
         available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
         and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may
         be, a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
         made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
         Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may
         be, severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
         demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day
         from and including the date such amount is made available to the Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may
         be, to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent,
         at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of (x) the Federal Funds
         Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
         accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation,
         except with respect to Foreign Currency Borrowings, the applicable rate
         shall be determined as specified in clause (y) above, or (ii) in the
         case of the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, the
         interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount
         to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
         Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                           SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving
         Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified
         in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency
         Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
         Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Parent Borrower or the applicable
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, may elect to convert
         such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and,
         in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing,


<PAGE>
                                                                              68


         may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.
         The Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as
         the case may be, may elect different options with respect to different
         portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
         shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
         comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion
         shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply
         to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

                           (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
         Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the
         case may be, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by
         telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under
         Section 2.03 if the Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, were requesting a Revolving
         Borrowing or Term Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to
         be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
         Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
         promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a
         written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
         Administrative Agent and signed by the Parent Borrower or the
         applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be.

                           (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election
         Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
         Section 2.02:

                           (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election
                  Request applies and, if different options are being elected
                  with respect to different portions thereof, the portions
                  thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which
                  case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii)
                  and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
                  Borrowing);

                           (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant
                  to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business
                  Day;

                           (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an
                  ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

                           (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency
                  Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
                  giving effect to such election, which shall be a

                                                                              69


                  period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest
                  Period".

         If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing
         but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Parent Borrower or
         the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall
         be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                           (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest
         Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of
         the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting
         Borrowing.

                           (e) If an Interest Election Request with respect to a
         Eurocurrency Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the
         Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is
         repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such
         Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (unless such Borrowing
         is a Foreign Currency Borrowing, in which case such Borrowing shall
         become due and payable on the last day of such Interest Period).
         Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
         request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower (on
         behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers), then, so long
         as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing
         (other than a Foreign Currency Borrowing) may be converted to or
         continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
         Eurocurrency Borrowing (other than a Foreign Currency Borrowing) shall
         be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period
         applicable thereto.

                           SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of
         Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Tranche D
         Commitments shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
         Effective Date and (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on
         the Revolving Maturity Date.

                           (b) The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) may at any time terminate, or from time
         to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class (it being understood that
         reductions of Revolving Commitments will automatically reduce Foreign
         Currency Commitments on a pro rata basis); provided that (i) each
         reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is
         an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and
         (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall not be terminated or reduced if,
         after giving effect


<PAGE>
                                                                              70


         to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with
         Section 2.11, the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total
         Revolving Commitments.

                           (c) The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) shall notify the Administrative Agent of
         any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b)
         of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective
         date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the
         effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
         Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.
         Each notice delivered by the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) pursuant to this Section shall be
         irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving
         Commitments delivered by the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) may state that such notice is
         conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the
         occurrence of another transaction, in which case such notice may be
         revoked by the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrowers) (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or
         prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
         satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class
         shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class
         shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
         respective Commitments of such Class.

                           SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
         (a) The Parent Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (with
         respect to Foreign Currency Loans made to such Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower) hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
         principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving
         Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
         Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of such
         Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline Lender
         the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier
         of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline
         Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at
         least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided
         that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing (other than a Foreign
         Currency Borrowing) is made, the Parent Borrower shall repay all
         Swingline Loans that were outstanding on the date such Borrowing was
         requested.

                                                                              71


                           (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
         usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
         the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers to such Lender
         resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
         principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to
         time hereunder.

                           (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts
         in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder,
         the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto,
         (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
         become due and payable from the Parent Borrower and the Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of
         any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account
         of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

                           (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained
         pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie
         evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded
         therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
         Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
         manner affect the obligation of the Parent Borrower and the Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of
         this Agreement.

                           (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class
         made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may
         be, shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note
         payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender,
         to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by
         the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
         promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including
         after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or
         more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee
         named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to
         such payee and its registered assigns).

                           SECTION 2.10. Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject
         to adjustment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, the Parent
         Borrower shall repay Tranche D Term Borrowings on each date set forth
         below in the aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such date:

                           (b) To the extent not previously paid, all Tranche D
         Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche D Maturity Date.

                           (c) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing shall be
         applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term
         Borrowings to be made pursuant to this Section ratably. Notwithstanding
         the foregoing, any prepayment of Eurocurrency Term Borrowings made
         pursuant to Section 2.11(a) on a date that is (x) the last day of an
         Interest Period and (y) no more than five days prior to a scheduled
         amortization payment pursuant to this Section shall be applied, first,
         to reduce such scheduled payment, and any excess shall be applied as
         required by the first sentence of this Section 2.10(c).

                           (d) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings
         hereunder, the Parent Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings
         to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
         (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m.,
         New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of
         such repayment. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably
         to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of Term
         Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount
         repaid.

                           SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Parent
         Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case may be,
         shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
         Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of this
         Section.

                           (b) In the event and on such occasion that the sum of
         the Revolving Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the
         Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case may
         be, shall prepay Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if
         no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an
         account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in
         an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

                           (c) In the event that the sum of the Foreign Currency
         Exposures exceeds (i) 105% of the total Foreign Currency Commitments
         solely as a result of currency fluctuations or (ii) the total Foreign
         Currency Commitments (other than as a result of currency fluctuations),
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers shall prepay Foreign Currency
         Borrowings (or if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash
         collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to
         Section 2.05(j)) in an amount equal to the amount by which the sum of
         Foreign Currency Exposures exceed the total Foreign Currency
         Commitments no later than in the case of clause (i) above the next
         Interest Payment Date and in the case of clause (ii), the first
         Business Day that such excess exists.

                           (d)(1) In the event and on each occasion that any Net
         Proceeds are received by or on behalf of Holdings, the Parent Borrower
         or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment Event (other than TriMas
         Available Proceeds and TriMas Specified Proceeds), the Parent Borrower
         shall, within three Business Days after such Net Proceeds are received,
         prepay Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to such Net
         Proceeds; provided that, in the case of any event described in clause
         (a) of the definition of the term Prepayment Event, if Holdings or the
         Parent Borrower shall deliver, within such three Business Days, to the
         Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect
         that Holdings, the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries intend to apply
         the Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof specified in
         such certificate), within 365 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds,
         to acquire real property, equipment or other tangible assets to be used
         in the business of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and
         certifying that no Default has occurred and is continuing, then no
         prepayment shall be required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
         the Net Proceeds in


<PAGE>
                                                                              74


         respect of such event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in
         such certificate, if applicable) except to the extent of any such Net
         Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of such
         365-day period, at which time a prepayment shall be required in an
         amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied.

                           (2) In the event that $205,000,000 of the TriMas
         Specified Proceeds are not applied to repurchase, redeem, repay or
         otherwise retire the Convertible Debentures or an irrevocable notice of
         redemption and deposit of such proceeds has not been delivered to the
         trustee thereunder within 90 days of the date that the TriMas
         Transaction is consummated, the Parent Borrower shall promptly
         thereafter apply the amount of TriMas Specified Proceeds not so used to
         prepay Term Borrowings.

                           (e) In the event and on each occasion that any Net
         Proceeds are received by or on behalf of Holdings, the Parent Borrower
         or any Subsidiary in respect of any Specified Prepayment Event, the
         Parent Borrower shall, within three Business Days after such Net
         Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount
         equal to such Net Proceeds.

                           (f) Following the end of each fiscal year of the
         Parent Borrower, commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31,
         2001, the Parent Borrower shall prepay Term Borrowings in an aggregate
         amount equal to 75% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year; provided
         that such percentage shall be reduced from 75% to 50% with respect to
         the prepayment under this paragraph (f), if the Parent Borrower's
         Leverage Ratio as of the last fiscal quarter preceding the applicable
         prepayment date is less than 3.00 to 1.00. Each prepayment pursuant to
         this paragraph shall be made on or before the date on which financial
         statements are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the
         fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and in any
         event within 95 days after the end of such fiscal year).

                           (g) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of
         Borrowings hereunder, the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings
         to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such
         prepayment pursuant to paragraph (h) of this Section.

                           (h) The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) shall notify the Administrative Agent
         (and, in the case of prepayment of a

                                                                              75


         Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by
         telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of
         a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
         time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the
         case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New
         York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii)
         in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00
         noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice
         shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the
         principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid
         and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed
         calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a
         notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional
         notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by
         Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such
         notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08.
         Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice
         relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administra tive Agent shall
         advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of
         any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case
         of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section
         2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a
         mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
         ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
         shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by
         Section 2.13.

                           SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The Parent Borrower (on
         behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) agrees to pay to
         the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment
         fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily
         unused amount of each Commitment of such Lender during the period from
         and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which
         such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in
         arrears (i) in the case of commitment fees in respect of the Revolving
         Commitments, on the last day of March, June, September and December of
         each year and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate,
         commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof and
         (ii) in the case of commitment fees in respect of the Tranche D Term
         Commitments, on the Effective Date or any earlier date on which such
         Commitments terminate. All commitment fees shall be computed on the
         basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number
         of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
         For purposes of computing commitment fees with

                                                                              76


         respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender
         shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving
         Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of
         such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).

                           (b) The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative
         Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with
         respect to its participa tions in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue
         at the same Applicable Rate as interest on Eurocurrency Revolving Loans
         on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
         portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during
         the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
         later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving Commitment
         terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC
         Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall
         accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of
         the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
         unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
         Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of
         the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any
         LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect
         to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
         Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and
         fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March,
         June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third
         Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date
         to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be
         payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and
         any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving
         Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
         payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable
         within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees
         shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
         payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
         but excluding the last day).

                           (c) The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) agrees to pay to the Administrative
         Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the
         times separately agreed upon between the Parent Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent.

                           (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the
         dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent
         (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for
         distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to
         the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under
         any circumstances.

                           SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each
         ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at
         the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

                           (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing
         shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period
         in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

                           (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal
         of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the
         Parent Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case may
         be, hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon
         acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
         after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in
         the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise
         applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this
         Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
         applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
         Section.

                           (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in
         arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of
         Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments;
         provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
         Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment
         or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving
         Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availabil ity Period), accrued
         interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on
         the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
         conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current
         Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be
         payable on the effective date of such conversion.

                           (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the
         basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on a Foreign
         Currency Borrowing denominated in Sterling and (ii) interest computed
         by reference to the Alternate Base

         Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate
         shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a
         leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of
         days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
         applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be
         determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error.

                           SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to
         the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing
         denominated in any currency:

                           (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which
                  determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that
                  adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
                  the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

                           (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the
                  Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest
                  Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
                  Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such
                  Borrowing for such Interest Period;

         then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent
         Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) and
         the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
         thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent
         Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) and
         the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
         exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion
         of any Borrowing denominated in such currency to, or continuation of
         any Borrowing denominated in such currency as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing
         shall be ineffective, and any Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in
         such currency that is requested to be continued (A) if such currency is
         the dollar, shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing on the last day of
         the Interest Period applicable thereto and (B) if such currency is a
         Foreign Currency, shall be repaid on the last day of the Interest
         Period applicable thereto and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a
         Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such currency (A) if such
         currency is the dollar, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR
         Borrowing and (B) if such currency is a Foreign Currency, such
         Borrowing Request shall be ineffective.

                           SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in
         Law shall:

                           (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
                  special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
                  deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
                  any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in
                  the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                           (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
                  London interbank market any other condition affecting this
                  Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any
                  Letter of Credit or participation therein;

         and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
         such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of
         maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the
         cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
         maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum
         received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder
         (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Parent Borrower
         or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case may be,
         will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
         additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the
         Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or
         reduction suffered.

                           (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that
         any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the
         effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing
         Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
         holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
         Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such
         Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level
         below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or
         the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such
         Change in Law (taking into considera tion such Lender's or the Issuing
         Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
         holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to
         time the Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers, as the case may be, will pay to such Lender or the Issuing
         Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
         compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the
         Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                           (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank
         setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender
         or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as
         specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to
         the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Parent
         Borrower or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, as the case
         may be, shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
         the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
         receipt thereof.

                           (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
         Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
         constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to
         demand such compensation; provided that neither the Parent Borrower nor
         any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall be required to compensate a
         Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased
         costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that
         such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the
         Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers) of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
         reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to
         claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in
         Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
         then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include
         the period of retroactive effect thereof.

                           SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of
         (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocur rency Loan other than
         on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as
         a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any
         Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
         applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
         prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
         notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may
         be revoked under Section 2.11(h) and is revoked in accordance
         therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on
         the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
         request by the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Parent Borrower
         or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be,
         shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
         attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such
         loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an
         amount

                                                                              81


         determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount
         of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such
         Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
         have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such
         event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or,
         in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period
         that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
         amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such
         period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid,
         at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable
         currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the
         Eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
         amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to
         this Section shall be delivered to the Parent Borrower (on behalf of
         itself and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) and shall be conclusive
         absent manifest error. The Parent Borrower or the applicable Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall pay such Lender the
         amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
         receipt thereof.

                           SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or
         on account of any obligation of the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
         made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes
         or Other Taxes; provided that if the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes
         or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
         increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
         (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
         Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case
         may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
         no such deductions been made, (ii) the Parent Borrower or such Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall make such deductions and
         (iii) the Parent Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the
         case may be, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
         Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                           (b) In addition, the Parent Borrower and each Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
         Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                           (c) The Parent Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower, as the case may be, shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
         each Lender and the Issuing Bank,

                                                                              82


         within 10 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full
         amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
         Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
         be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any
         obligation of the Parent Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower,
         as the case may be, hereunder or under any other Loan Document
         (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
         attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties,
         interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
         thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
         correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
         Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
         delivered to the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as
         the case may be, by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
         Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the
         Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                           (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of
         Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Parent Borrower or
         such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall deliver to
         the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
         issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
         of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
         reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                           (e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
         or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in
         which the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the
         case may be, is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
         party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to
         the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers) (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or
         times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
         executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
         requested by the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrowers) as will permit such payments to be made without
         withholding or at a reduced rate.

                           (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender (or a
         transferee) determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a
         refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
         by the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or with
         respect to which the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary

                                                                              83


         Borrowers) has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17,
         it shall pay over such refund to the Parent Borrower (but only to the
         extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the
         Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower under this Section
         2.17 with respect to the Taxes or the Other Taxes giving rise to such
         refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent
         or such Lender (or Transferee) and without interest (other than any
         interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
         such refund); provided, however, that the Parent Borrower or any
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative
         Agent or such Lender (or Transferee), agrees to repay the amount paid
         over to the Parent Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other
         charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) in the event the
         Administrative Agent or such Lender (or Transferee) is required to
         repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in
         this Section 2.17(f) shall require the Administrative Agent or any
         Lender to make available its tax returns or any other information
         relating to its taxes which it deems confidential to the Parent
         Borrower or any other person.

                           SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment;
         Sharing of Set-offs. (a) The Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) shall make each payment required to
         be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of
         principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of
         amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) on or
         before the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan
         Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required,
         prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, or if the applicable Loan is a
         Foreign Currency Loan, London time), on the date when due, in
         immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
         amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of
         the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next
         succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.
         All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
         offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York (unless otherwise
         instructed in the case of Foreign Currency Loans), except payments to
         be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly
         provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15,
         2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled
         thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to
         the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent

                                                                              84


         shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of
         any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
         receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on
         a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be
         extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
         payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
         period of such extension. Subject to Section 9.01, all payments under
         each Loan Document of principal or interest in respect of any Loan or
         LC Disbursement shall be made in the currency of such Loan or LC
         Disbursement; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan
         Document shall be made in dollars.

                           (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by
         and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of
         principal, unreimbursed LC Disburse ments, interest and fees then due
         hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
         interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
         entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
         then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
         and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the
         parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal
         and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                           (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
         set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
         principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or
         participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such
         Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate
         amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
         Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
         proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
         greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
         participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in
         LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent
         necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by
         the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of
         principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans,
         Term Loans and participa tions in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
         provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or
         any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
         participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to
         the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions
         of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
         by the Parent

                                                                              85


         Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to and in
         accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
         obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of
         a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC
         Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Parent
         Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the
         provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Parent Borrower and each
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
         the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
         Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements
         may exercise against the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower, as the case may be, rights of set-off and counterclaim with
         respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
         creditor of the Parent Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in
         the amount of such participation.

                           (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
         received notice from the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) prior to the date on which any payment is
         due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the
         Issuing Bank hereunder that the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, will not make such payment,
         the Administrative Agent may assume that the Parent Borrower or such
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, has made such payment
         on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
         assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case
         may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Parent Borrower or such
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made
         such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case
         may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
         on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with
         interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount
         is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
         Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
         Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
         with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                           (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment
         required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e),
         2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its
         discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
         amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account
         of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such


<PAGE>
                                                                              86


         Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

                           SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of
         Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or
         if the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is required
         to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
         Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then
         such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
         lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign
         its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
         branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
         designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable
         pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and
         (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense
         and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Parent
         Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers)
         hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any
         Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

                           (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section
         2.15, or if the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is
         required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
         Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if
         any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
         Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers) may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
         Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
         delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
         restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and
         obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by the Parent
         Borrower that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be
         another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i)
         the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers) shall have received the prior written consent of the
         Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned,
         the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not
         unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment
         of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
         participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued
         interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
         hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
         principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Parent Borrower and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers (in the case


<PAGE>
                                                                              87


         of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
         resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments
         required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will
         result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A
         Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation
         if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,
         the circumstances entitling the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to
         apply.

                           SECTION 2.20. Additional Reserve Costs. (a) If and so
         long as any Revolving Lender is required to make special deposits with
         the Bank of England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees,
         in each case in respect of such Revolving Lender's Foreign Currency
         Loans, such Revolving Lender may require the relevant Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of
         interest on each of such Foreign Currency Loans, additional interest on
         such Foreign Currency Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory
         Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner
         set forth in Exhibit I hereto.

                           (b) If and so long as any Revolving Lender is
         required to comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other
         requirements of any monetary or other authority (including any such
         requirement imposed by the European Central Bank or the European System
         of Central Banks, but excluding requirements reflected in the Statutory
         Reserve Rate or the Mandatory Costs Rate) in respect of any of such
         Revolving Lender's Foreign Currency Loans, such Revolving Lender may
         require the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to pay,
         contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such
         Revolving Lender's Foreign Currency Loans subject to such requirements,
         additional interest on such Foreign Currency Loan at a rate per annum
         specified by such Revolving Lender to be the cost to such Revolving
         Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Foreign
         Currency Loan.

                           (c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to
         paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be determined by the relevant
         Revolving Lender, which determination shall be conclusive absent
         manifest error, and notified to the Parent Borrower (on behalf of the
         relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower) (with a copy to the
         Administrative Agent)) at least five Business Days before each date on
         which interest is payable for the relevant Foreign Currency Loan, and
         such additional interest so notified by such Revolving Lender shall be
         payable to the Administrative Agent for the account


<PAGE>
                                                                              88


         of such Revolving Lender on each date on which interest is payable for
         such Foreign Currency Loan.

                           SECTION 2.21. Designation of Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers. The Parent Borrower may at any time and from time to time
         designate any Foreign Subsidiary as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, by
         delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrowing
         Agreement executed by such Foreign Subsidiary and the Parent Borrower,
         and upon such delivery such Foreign Subsidiary shall for all purposes
         of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents be a Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower until the Parent Borrower shall terminate such designation
         pursuant to a termination agreement satisfactory to the Administrative
         Agent, whereupon such Foreign Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement and any other
         applicable Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no
         such termination will become effective as to any Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to
         such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is outstanding. As soon as practicable
         upon receipt of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrowing Agreement, the
         Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.

                           SECTION 2.22. Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Costs. (a)
         If the cost to any Revolving Lender of making or maintaining any
         Foreign Currency Loan to a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is increased (or
         the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Revolving Lender
         (or its applicable lending office) is reduced) by an amount deemed in
         good faith by such Revolving Lender to be material, by reason of the
         fact that such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is incorporated in, or
         conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the United States, such
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify such Revolving Lender for
         such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such
         Revolving Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). A
         certificate of such Revolving Lender claiming compensation under this
         paragraph and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid
         to it hereunder (and the basis for the calculation of such amount or
         amounts) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                           (b) Each Revolving Lender will promptly notify the
         Parent Borrower (on behalf of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower)
         and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge
         that will entitle such Revolving Lender to additional interest or
         payments pursuant to paragraph (a) above, but in any event within 45

         thereof; provided that (i) if any Revolving Lender fails to give such
         notice within 45 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an
         event, such Revolving Lender shall, with respect to compensation
         payable pursuant to this Section 2.21 in respect of any costs resulting
         from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 2.21
         for costs incurred from and after the date 45 days prior to the date
         that such Revolving Lender does give such notice and (ii) each
         Revolving Lender will designate a different applicable lending office,
         if, in the judgment of such Revolving Lender, such designation will
         avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will
         not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Revolving Lender.

                         Representations and Warranties

                           Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and each
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (as to itself only) represents and warrants

         under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
         requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted
         and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the

         Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing
         in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

         and the Parent Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document
         to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered
         by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
         obligation of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or such Loan Party (as the
         case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other

                           SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.
         The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of,

         not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or
         other organizational documents of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any
         of its Subsidiaries (including the Receivables Subsidiary) or any order
         of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a
         default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon
         Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
         Receivables Subsidiary) or its assets, or give rise to a right
         thereunder to require any payment to be made by Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Receivables
         Subsidiary), except for violations, defaults or the creation of such
         rights that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition
         of any Lien on any asset of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries (including the Receivables Subsidiary), except Liens
         created under the Loan Documents and Liens permitted by Section 6.02.

                           SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material

         dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end

         referred to above or the notes thereto or in the Information
         Memorandum, except for the Disclosed Matters and except for liabilities

         (including


<PAGE>
                                                                              91


         the Receivables Subsidiary and the Saturn Subsidiary) has, as of the
         Effective Date, any contingent liabilities that would be material to
         Holdings, the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries (including the
         Receivables Subsidiary and the Saturn Subsidiary), taken as a whole.

                           (c) Since December 31, 2001, there has been no event,
         change or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
         could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                           SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of Holdings, the
         Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid
         leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to
         its business (including its Mortgaged Properties), except for minor
         defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its
         business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their
         intended purposes.

                           (b) Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames,
         copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its
         business, and the use thereof by Holdings, the Parent Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person,
         except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
         aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                           (c) As of the Effective Date, neither Holdings, the
         Parent Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
         of any pending or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any
         Mortgaged Property or any sale or disposition thereof in lieu of
         condemnation. Neither any Mortgaged Property nor any interest therein
         is subject to any right of first refusal, option or other contractual
         right to purchase such Mortgaged Property or interest therein.

                           SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters.
         (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any
         arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the

         affecting Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         (including the Receivables Subsidiary) (i) as to which there is a
         reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
         adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in
         the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the
         Disclosed Matters) or


<PAGE>
                                                                              92


         (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

                           (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with
         respect to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect, neither Holdings, the Parent Borrower nor any of its
         Subsidiaries (including the Receivables Subsidiary) (i) has failed to
         comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with
         any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental

                           (c) Since the date of the Original Credit Agreement,
         there has been no change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that,
         individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in, or materially
         increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect.

                           SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agree ments.
         Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including
         the Receivables Subsidiary) is in compliance with all laws, regulations
         and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
         property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding
         upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so,
         individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is
         continuing.

                           SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status.
         Neither Holdings, the Parent Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
         (including the Receivables Subsidiary) is (a) an "investment company"
         as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company
         Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to
         regula tion under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

                           SECTION 3.09. Taxes. Each of Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including the Receivables Subsidiary)

         Holdings, the Parent Borrower or such Subsidiary (including the
         Receivables Subsidiaries), as applicable, has set aside on its books
         adequate reserves or (b) to the


<PAGE>
                                                                              93


         extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                           SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or
         is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all
         other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to
         occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect. As of the Recapitalization Date, the present value of all
         accumulated benefit obligations under any one Plan (based on the
         assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
         Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
         statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $23,000,000 the
         fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of
         all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
         the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
         Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
         statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $40,000,000 the
         fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

                           SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. Each of Holdings and the
         Parent Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all agreements,
         instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which Holdings, the
         Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Receivables
         Subsidiary) is subject, and all other matters known to any of them,
         that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
         result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information Memorandum
         nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or
         other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation
         of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or
         thereunder (as modified or supple mented by other information so
         furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state
         any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
         light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
         provided that, with respect to projected financial information,
         Holdings and the Parent Borrower represent only that such information
         was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
         reasonable at the time such projections were prepared.

                           SECTION 3.12. Subsidiaries. Holdings does not have
         any subsidiaries other than the Parent Borrower, the Saturn Subsidiary
         and the Parent Borrower's Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the
         name of, and the ownership interest of the Parent Borrower in, each
         Subsidiary of the


<PAGE>
                                                                              94


         Parent Borrower and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary
         Loan Party, in each case as of the Effective Date.

                           SECTION 3.13. Insurance. As of the Effective Date,
         all premiums due in respect of material insurance policies maintained
         by or on behalf of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries
         as of the Effective Date have been paid.

                           SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Effective
         Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against Holdings, the
         Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of
         Holdings or the Parent Borrower, threatened that could reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All payments due from
         Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim
         may be made against Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, on
         account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other
         benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of
         Holdings, the Parent Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of
         the Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or
         right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective
         bargaining agreement to which Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any
         Subsidiary is bound.

                           SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the
         consummation of the Transactions to occur on the Effective Date and
         immediately following the making of each Loan made on the Effective
         Date and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such
         Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of each Loan Party, at a fair
         valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
         contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the
         property of each Loan Party will be greater than the amount that will
         be required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other
         liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
         other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will
         be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
         otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured;
         and (d) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis, will not have
         unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which
         it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be
         conducted following the Effective Date.

                           SECTION 3.16.  Senior Indebtedness.  To
         the extent any Subordinated Debt is outstanding, the Obligations



<PAGE>
                                                                              95


         constitute "Senior Indebtedness" under and as defined in the
         Subordinated Debt Documents.

                           SECTION 3.17. Security Documents. (a) The Pledge
         Agreement is effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for
         the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable
         security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Pledge
         Agreement) and, when such Collateral is delivered to the Collateral
         Agent and for so long as the Collateral Agent remains in possession of
         such Collateral, the security interest created by the Pledge Agreement
         shall constitute a perfected first priority security interest in all
         right, title and interest of the pledgor thereunder in such Collateral,
         in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person.

                           (b) The Security Agreement is effective to create in
         favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties,
         a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as
         defined in the Security Agreement) and, when financing statements in
         appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 6 to
         the Perfection Certificate, the security interest created by the
         Security Agreement shall constitute a perfected security interest in
         all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such
         Collateral (other than the Intellectual Property (as defined in the
         Security Agreement)), in each case prior and superior in right to any
         other Person, other than with respect to Liens permitted by Section
         6.02.

                           (c) When the Security Agreement (or a summary
         thereof) is filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
         the United States Copyright Office and the financing statements
         referred to in Section 3.17(b) above are appropriately filed, the
         security interest created by the Security Agreement shall constitute a
         perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of the
         grantors thereunder in the Intellectual Property (as defined in the
         Security Agreement) in which a security interest may be perfected by
         filing, recording or registering a security agreement, financing
         statement or analogous document in the United States Patent and
         Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, as applicable,
         in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person (it being
         understood that subsequent recordings in the United States Patent and
         Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office and subsequent
         UCC filings may be necessary to perfect a lien on registered
         trademarks, trademark applications and copyrights acquired by the Loan
         Parties after the Effective Date), other than with respect to Liens
         permitted by Section 6.02.

                           (d) The Mortgages are effective to create, subject to
         the exceptions listed in each title insurance policy covering such
         Mortgage, in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the
         Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of the
         applicable mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to the
         Mortgaged Properties thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and when the
         Mortgages are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 3.17(d), the
         Lien created by each Mortgage shall constitute a perfected Lien on all
         right, title and interest of the applicable mortgagor in such Mortgaged
         Properties and the proceeds thereof, in each case prior and superior in
         right to any other Person, other than with respect to the rights of
         Persons pursuant to Liens permitted by Section 6.02.

                           (e) Following the execution of any Foreign Security
         Document pursuant to Section 4.03, each Foreign Security Document shall
         be effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the
         benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security
         interest in the applicable collateral covered by such Foreign Security
         Document, and when the actions specified in such Foreign Security
         Document, if any, are completed, the security interest created by such
         Foreign Security Document shall constitute a perfected security
         interest in all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in

                           form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
                           Agent and its counsel.

         times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected
         security interest in all the Collateral.

                           (b) Each year, at the time of delivery of annual

         confirming that there has been no change in such information since the
         date of the Perfection Certificate delivered on the Effective Date or
         the date of the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this
         Section and (ii) certifying that all Uniform Commercial Code financing
         statements (including fixture filings, as applicable) or other

         any merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under
         Section 6.03 or disposition by Section 6.05. Holdings and the Parent

         obligation and the enforcement of any Lien securing such obligation and
         (d) the failure to make payment pending such contest could not
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.03

         financially sound and reputable insurance companies, except that a

         portion of such insurance program (not to exceed that which is
         customary in the case of companies engaged in the same or similar
         business or having similar properties similarly situated) may be
         effected through self-insurance, provided adequate reserves therefor,
         in accordance with GAAP, are maintained. In addition, each of Holdings,
         the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers will, and will
         cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain all insurance required to
         be maintained pursuant to the Security Documents. The Parent Borrower

         Lenders may reasonably request, to cause the Collateral and Guarantee
         Requirement to be and remain satisfied, all at the expense of the Loan
         Parties. Holdings, the Parent Borrower and the Foreign

         improvements thereto or any interest therein) having a book value or
         fair market value of $1,000,000 or more in the aggregate are acquired
         by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party after the Effective

                  any such judgment;

                           (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the
                  opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all
                  other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be
                  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Holdings,
                  the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries;

                           (m) any Lien covering property having a book value or
                  fair market value of $1,000,000 or more purported to be
                  created under any Security Document shall cease to be, or
                  shall be asserted by any Loan Party not to be, a valid and
                  perfected Lien on any Collateral, except (i) as a result of
                  the sale or other disposition of the applicable Collateral in
                  a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or (ii) as a
                  result of the Administrative Agent's failure to maintain
                  possession of any stock certificates, promissory notes or
                  other instruments delivered to it under the Collateral
                  Agreement;

                           (n) the Guarantee Agreement shall cease to
                  be, or shall have been asserted not to be, in full
                  force and effect;

                           (o) the Parent Borrower, Holdings or any Subsidiary
                  shall challenge the subordination provisions of the
                  Subordinated Debt or assert that such provisions are invalid
                  or unenforceable or that the Obligations of the Parent
                  Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, or the
                  Obligations of Holdings or any Subsidiary under the Guarantee
                  Agreement, are not senior indebtedness under the subordination
                  provisions of the Subordinated Debt, or any court, tribunal or
                  government authority of competent jurisdiction shall judge the
                  subordination provisions of the Subordinated Debt to be
                  invalid or unenforceable or such Obligations to be not senior
                  indebtedness under such subordination provisions or otherwise
                  cease to be, or shall be asserted not to be, legal, valid and
                  binding obligations of the parties thereto, enforceable in
                  accordance with their terms; or

                           (p) a Change in Control shall occur;

         then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the
         Parent Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at
         any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the
         Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders
         shall, by notice to the Parent Borrower, take either or both of the
         following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
         Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately,
         and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in
         whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be
         due and payable may there after be declared to be due and payable), and
         thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable,
         together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
         obligations of the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without
         presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
         are hereby waived by the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers; and in case of any event with respect to the Parent Borrower
         or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
         this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the
         principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest
         thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Parent Borrower or
         any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically
         become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other
         notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Parent
         Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                           Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby
         irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (it being understood that
         reference in this Article VIII to the Administrative Agent shall be
         deemed to include the Collateral Agent) as its agent and authorizes the
         Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to
         exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by
         the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers
         as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                           The bank serving as the Administrative Agent
         hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
         Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
         not the Administrative Agent, and


<PAGE>
                                                                             131


         such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
         and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not
         the Administrative Agent hereunder.

                           The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
         obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.
         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the
         Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other
         implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
         continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
         take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers,
         except discretionary rights and powers expressly contem plated by the
         Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in
         writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
         the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided
         in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan
         Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
         disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
         information relating to Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
         Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
         Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not
         taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
         (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
         necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in
         the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The
         Administrative Agent shall not be deemed not to have knowledge of any
         Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
         Administrative Agent by Holdings, the Parent Borrower, a Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not
         be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)
         any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with
         any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or
         other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii)
         the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
         other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the
         validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan
         Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
         satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in
         any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
         required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                           The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely
         upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice,
         request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
         writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by
         the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any
         statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be
         made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
         relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal
         counsel (who may be counsel for the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
         selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
         taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel,
         accountants or experts.

                           The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its
         duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more
         sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
         Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and
         exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related
         Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall
         apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each
         Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
         respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
         facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative
         Agent.

                           Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
         successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the
         Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders,
         the Issuing Bank and the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and the
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers). Upon any such resignation, the Required
         Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Parent Borrower
         and, if applicable, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, to
         appoint a successor from among the Lenders. If no successor shall have
         been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
         appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
         gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent
         may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor
         Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York,
         New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
         appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such
         successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
         powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
         the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
         and obligations


<PAGE>
                                                                             133


         hereunder. The fees payable by the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself
         and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) to a successor Administrative
         Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
         otherwise agreed between the Parent Borrower (on behalf of itself and
         the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) and such successor. After the
         Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
         Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of
         such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective
         Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken
         by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                           Each Lender acknowledges that it has, indepen dently
         and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender
         and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
         appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
         this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,
         independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
         other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall
         from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions
         in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any
         other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished
         hereunder or thereunder.

                           The Lenders identified in this Agreement as the
         Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents shall not have any
         right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
         Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders. Without limiting
         the foregoing, none of the Syndication Agent or the Documentation
         Agents shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with
         any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with
         respect to the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents as it
         makes with respect to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender in
         this Article VIII.

                         Collection Allocation Mechanism

                           SECTION 9.01. Implementation of CAM. (a) On the CAM
         Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments shall automatically and without
         further act be terminated as provided in Article VII, (ii) all Foreign
         Currency Borrowings and the Commitments to make Foreign Currency Loans
         shall be converted into, and all such amounts due thereunder shall
         accrue and be payable in, dollars at the Exchange Rate on such date and
         (iii) the Lenders shall automatically and


<PAGE>
                                                                             134


         without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section
         10.04) be deemed to have exchanged interests in the Credit Facilities
         such that in lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Credit
         Facility in which it shall participate as of such date (including such
         Lender's interest in the Specified Obligations of each Loan Party in
         respect of each such Credit Facility), such Lender shall hold an
         interest in every one of the Credit Facilities (including the Specified
         Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of each such Credit Facility
         and each LC Reserve Account established pursuant to Section 9.02
         below), whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated
         therein, equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage thereof. Each Lender and
         each Loan Party hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and
         each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its
         successors and assigns and any person that acquires a participation in
         its interests in any Credit Facility. Each Loan Party agrees from time
         to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all
         promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the
         Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm
         the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM
         Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes
         originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the
         Administrative Agent against delivery of new promissory notes
         evidencing its interests in the Credit Facilities; provided, however,
         that the failure of any Loan Party to execute or deliver or of any
         Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall
         not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.

                           (b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after
         the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative
         Agent or the Collateral Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect
         of the Specified Obligations, and each distribution made by the
         Collateral Agent pursuant to any Security Documents in respect of the
         Specified Obliga tions, shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in
         accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment
         received by a Lender upon or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by
         way of setoff, in respect of a Specified Obligation shall be paid over
         to the Administra tive Agent for distribution to the Lenders in
         accordance herewith.

                           SECTION 9.02. Letters of Credit. (a) In the event
         that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding
         and undrawn in whole or in part, or any amount drawn under a Letter of
         Credit shall not have been reimbursed either by the Parent Borrower or
         any Foreign


<PAGE>
                                                                             135


         Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, or with the proceeds of a
         Revolving Borrowing, each Revolving Lender shall promptly pay over to
         the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds and in the
         currency that such Letters of Credit are denominated, an amount equal
         to such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage (as notified to such
         Lender by the Administrative Agent) of such Letter of Credit's undrawn
         face amount or (to the extent it has not already done so) such Letter
         of Credit's unreimbursed drawing, together with interest thereon from
         the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to
         the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at the
         time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to such
         amount, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall establish a
         separate account or accounts for each Lender (each, an "LC Reserve
         Account") for the amounts received with respect to each such Letter of
         Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Administrative Agent
         shall deposit in each Lender's LC Reserve Account such Lender's CAM
         Percentage of the amounts received from the Revolving Lenders as
         provided above. The Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and
         control over each LC Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in each
         LC Reserve Account shall be held in such LC Reserve Account until
         withdrawn as provided in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) below. The
         Administrative Agent shall maintain records enabling it to determine
         the amounts paid over to it and deposited in the LC Reserve Accounts in
         respect of each Letter of Credit and the amounts on deposit in respect
         of each Letter of Credit attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage.
         The amounts held in each Lender's LC Reserve Account shall be held as a
         reserve against the LC Exposure, shall be the property of such Lender,
         shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against
         any Loan Party and shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of
         the Parent Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers to pay interest
         to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in
         respect of Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings
         are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05.

                           (b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any
         drawing shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit, the
         Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Issuing Bank withdraw
         from the LC Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to the
         amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing, deposited in
         respect of such Letter of Credit and remaining on deposit and deliver
         such amounts to the Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement
         obligations of the Revolving Lenders under Section 2.05(e) (but not of
         the Parent Borrower and the


<PAGE>
                                                                             136


         Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers under Section 2.05(f), respectively). In
         the event any Revolving Lender shall default on its obligation to pay
         over any amount to the Administrative Agent in respect of any Letter of
         Credit as provided in this Section 9.02, the Issuing Bank shall, in the
         event of a drawing thereunder, have a claim against such Revolving
         Lender to the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its
         obligations under Section 2.05(e), but shall have no claim against any
         other Lender in respect of such defaulted amount, notwithstanding the
         exchange of interests in the reimbursement obligations pursuant to
         Section 9.01. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such
         defaulting Revolving Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result
         of such default, including, in the event such Letter of Credit shall
         expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the defaulted amount.

                           (c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any
         Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, the Administra tive Agent shall
         withdraw from the LC Reserve Account of each Lender the amount
         remaining on deposit therein in respect of such Letter of Credit and
         distribute such amount to such Lender.

                           (d) With the prior written approval of the
         Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, any Lender may withdraw the
         amount held in its LC Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount
         of any Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be
         unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a
         drawing under such Letter of Credit, to pay over to the Administrative
         Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank on demand, its CAM
         Percentage of such drawing.

                           (e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any
         amounts from its LC Reserve Account as contemplated by the above
         paragraphs, the Administrative Agent will, at the direction of such
         Lender and subject to such rules as the Administrative Agent may
         prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest such amounts in
         Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its CAM
         Percentage of amounts in its LC Reserve Account as provided in para
         graph (d) above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified
         by the Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so
         made by the Administrative Agent with amounts in its LC Reserve Account
         and to retain such earnings for its own account.

         Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices
         and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
         hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto
         in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to
         have been given on the date of receipt.

                           SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or
         delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in
         exercising any right or power here under or under any other Loan
         Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
         partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
         discontinu ance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any
         other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or
         power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
         cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they
         would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document
         or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any
         event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b)
         of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
         only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan
         or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of
         any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender
         or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at
         the time.

                           (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan
         Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or
         modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an
         agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower, each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (but only to the extent such
         waiver, amendment or modification relates to such Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower) and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan
         Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
         into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties
         that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required
         Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the
         Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender,
         (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or
         reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable
         hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
         (iii) postpone the maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of
         payment of the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.10, or
         the required

                                                                             139


         date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any date for the
         payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount
         of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of
         expiration of any Commitment or postpone the scheduled date of
         expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Maturity Date,
         without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv)
         change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
         sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of
         each Lender, (v) change the percentage set forth in the definition of
         "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document
         (including this Section) specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
         (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights
         thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder,
         without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such
         Class, as the case may be), (vi) release Holdings or any Subsidiary
         Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement (except as
         expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement), or limit its liability
         in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each
         Lender, (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from
         the Liens of the Security Documents, without the written consent of
         each Lender or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a
         manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of
         payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than
         those holding Loans of any other Class, without the written consent of
         Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and
         unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided further that (A) no
         such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
         duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
         Lender without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
         the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B)
         any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its
         terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the
         Revolving Lenders (but not the Tranche D Lenders) or the Tranche D
         Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders), may be effected by an
         agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower, each Foreign

                                                                             140

         Subsidiary Parent Borrower (but only to the extent such waiver,
         amendment or modification relates to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower)
         and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders
         that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if such
         Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be
         amended by an agreement in writing entered into by Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower, each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (but only to the extent such
         waiver, amendment or modification relates to such Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrower), the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if
         their rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Bank and
         the Swingline Lender) if (i) by the terms of such agreement the
         Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for
         therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and
         (ii) at the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not
         consenting thereto receives payment in full of the principal of and
         interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other amounts owing to
         it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

                           SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
         (a) Holdings, the Parent Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower,
         jointly and severally, shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
         expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates,
         including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel
         in each applicable jurisdiction for the Administrative Agent, in
         connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
         herein, due diligence investigation, the preparation and administration
         of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of
         the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated
         hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable
         out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with
         the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
         or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket
         expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
         Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
         for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in
         connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
         connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this
         Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit
         issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred
         during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
         Loans or Letters of Credit.

                           (b) Holdings, the Parent Borrower and each Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each
         Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being
         called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless
         from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related
         expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
         for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any


<PAGE>
                                                                             141


         Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i)
         the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement
         or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to
         the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the
         consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
         hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds
         therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand
         for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in
         connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of
         such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release
         of Hazardous Materials on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other
         property currently or formerly owned or operated by the Parent Borrower
         or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in
         any way to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any
         actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
         relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or
         any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party
         thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee,
         be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
         liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
         the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                           (c) To the extent that Holdings, the Parent Borrower
         and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers fail to pay any amount required to
         be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
         Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each
         Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
         Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro
         rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
         expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided
         that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
         liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
         asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
         Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a
         Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of
         the sum of the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and
         unused Commitments at the time.

                           (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, none
         of Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee,
         on any theory of


<PAGE>
                                                                             142


         liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
         opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection
         with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
         contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or
         the use of the proceeds thereof.

                           (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be
         payable promptly after written demand therefor.

                           (f) Neither Heartland nor any director, officer,
         employee, stockholder or member, as such, of any Loan Party or
         Heartland shall have any liability for the Obligations or for any claim
         based on, in respect of or by reason of the Obligations or their
         creation; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to relieve
         any Loan Party of its Obligations under any Loan Document.

                           SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The
         provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
         benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
         assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank
         that issues any Letter of Credit), except that none of Holdings, the
         Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower may assign or
         otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
         the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment
         or transfer by the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this
         Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
         Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
         assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank
         that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly
         contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative
         Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right,
         remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                           (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees
         all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
         (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time
         owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to
         a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of the Parent Borrower, each
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (but only to the extent such assignment
         relates to Foreign Currency Commitments or Foreign Currency Loans
         relating to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower) and the Administrative
         Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a
         Revolving Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC
         Exposure or

         Swingline Exposure, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender) must
         give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case
         of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of
         the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or
         Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender
         subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
         Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
         to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than (x) in the case of
         Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans, $5,000,000, and (y) in the
         case of Tranche D Commitments and Tranche D Loans, $1,000,000 unless
         each of the Parent Borrower, each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (but only
         to the extent such assignment relates to Foreign Currency Commitments
         or Foreign Currency Loans relating to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower)
         and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
         assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of
         all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
         except that this clause (iii) shall not be construed to prohibit the
         assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans, (iv)
         notwithstanding anything to the contrary, assignments by any Revolving
         Lender of any portion of its Revolving Commitments or any portion of
         Revolving Loans must include a ratable portion of its Foreign Currency
         Commitments and ratable portion of its Foreign Currency Loans and visa
         versa, (v) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
         the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
         processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (vi) the assignee, if it
         shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
         Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that any consent of
         the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower otherwise
         required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of
         Default under Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Subject to
         acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
         Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
         and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to
         the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
         have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement
         (provided that any liability of the Parent Borrower or any Foreign
         Subsidiary Borrower to such assignee under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17
         shall be limited to the amount, if any, that would have been payable
         thereunder by the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in
         the absence of such assignment), and the assigning Lender thereunder
         shall, to

                                                                             144


         the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
         be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case
         of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
         rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
         be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
         Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
         Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
         comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
         Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
         and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

                           (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose
         as an agent of the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York
         a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register
         for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
         Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements
         owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
         (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and
         Holdings, the Parent Borrower, the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, the
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each
         Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
         hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
         for inspection by the Parent Borrower, the Foreign Subsidiary
         Borrowers, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and
         from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                           (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment
         and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
         assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee
         shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation
         fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written
         consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section,
         the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance
         and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
         assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it
         has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                           (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Parent
         Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
         the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or
         more banks or other

                                                                             145


         entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
         Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
         obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
         Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
         the performance of such obligations and (iii) Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower, the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, the Administrative Agent,
         the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely
         and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
         pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
         that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan
         Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
         provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or
         instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent
         of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
         described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such
         Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Parent
         Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers agree that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16
         and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
         interest by assignment pursuant to para graph (b) of this Section. To
         the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
         the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such
         Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a
         Lender.

                           (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive
         any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable
         Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
         participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
         participation to such Participant is made with the prior written
         consent of the Parent Borrower and, to the extent applicable, each
         relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. A Participant that would be a
         Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
         benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Parent Borrower and, to the extent
         applicable, each relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is notified of
         the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees,
         for the benefit of the Parent Borrower and, to the extent applicable,
         each relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, to comply with Section
         2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

                           (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
         security interest in all or any portion of its rights under


<PAGE>
                                                                             146


         this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
         pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank,
         and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
         security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a
         security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
         hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
         a party hereto.

                           SECTION 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agree ments,
         representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan
         Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
         connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
         Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other
         parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan
         Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of
         Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or
         on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the
         Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
         Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit
         is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
         long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee
         or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and
         unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the
         Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections
         2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
         full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the
         expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments
         or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                           SECTION 10.06. Counterparts; Integration;
         Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by
         different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which
         shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
         shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan
         Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
         payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract
         among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
         any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,
         relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section
         4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
         executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Admini strative Agent
         shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together,
         bear the signatures of each of


<PAGE>
                                                                             147


         the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and
         inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
         successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
         signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as
         delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                           SECTION 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this
         Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
         jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
         extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
         affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
         provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a
         particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any
         other jurisdiction.

                           SECTION 10.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of
         its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time,
         to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
         all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
         at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender
         or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Parent Borrower
         or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower against any of and all the
         obligations of the Parent Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
         now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
         irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand
         under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured.
         The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other
         rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such
         Lender may have.

                           SECTION 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent
         to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in
         accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

                           (b) Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and each
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction
         of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
         County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District
         of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
         proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for
         recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
         hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
         respect of any


<PAGE>
                                                                             148


         such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York
         State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each
         of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action
         or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
         jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
         by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
         affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
         Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
         this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower, any of the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or their properties
         in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                           (c) Each of Holdings, the Parent Borrower and each
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
         waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
         objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
         any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in
         paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
         irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
         of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
         proceeding in any such court.

                           (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents
         to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
         10.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect
         the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
         manner permitted by law.

                           SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY
         HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
         LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
         DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
         ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
         (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY
         HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
         OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
         PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
         FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
         HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
         THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                           SECTION 10.11. Headings. Article and Section headings

         Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
         consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                           SECTION 10.12. Confidentiality. Each of the
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to
         maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
         except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Lender
         Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
         accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that
         the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
         confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
         Information confidential pursuant to the terms hereof), (b) to the
         extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent
         required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
         similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
         connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
         action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
         Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f)
         subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
         those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
         prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or
         obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective
         counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
         relating to the Parent Borrower, any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and
         their respective obligations or (iii) any direct or indirect
         contractual counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap transaction
         relating to a Lender's obligations hereunder, (g) with the consent of
         the Parent Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) is
         publicly available at the time of disclosure or becomes publicly
         available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii)
         becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
         Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Holdings,
         the Parent Borrower or


<PAGE>
                                                                             150


         any Subsidiary (including the Receivables Subsidiary and the Saturn
         Subsidiary). For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all
         information received from Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any
         Subsidiary (including the Receivables Subsidiary and the Saturn
         Subsidiary) relating to Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary
         (including the Receivables Subsidiary and the Saturn Subsidiary) or its
         business, other than any such information that is available to the
         Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a
         nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Holdings, the Parent
         Borrower or any Subsidiary (including the Receivables Subsidiary and
         the Saturn Subsidiary); provided that, in the case of information
         received from Holdings, the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary
         (including the Receivables Subsidiary and the Saturn Subsidiary) after
         the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of
         delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
         confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
         considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person
         has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality
         of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
         information.

                           SECTION 10.13. Interest Rate Limitation.
         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the
         interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges
         and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under
         applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum
         lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
         taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
         accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect
         of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect
         thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent
         lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in
         respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation
         of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable
         to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
         (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
         together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to
         the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                           SECTION 10.14. Judgment Currency. (a) The obligations
         hereunder of the Parent Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers
         and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in Dollars or in
         the Foreign Currencies, as the case may be, (the "Obligation Currency")
         shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant
         to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency other than
         the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or
         recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent,
         the Collateral Agent or a Lender of the full amount of the Obligation
         Currency expressed to be payable to the Administrative Agent,
         Collateral Agent or Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan
         Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment
         against the Parent Borrower, any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or any
         other Loan Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes
         necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the
         Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to
         as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due in the Obligation


<PAGE>
                                                                             151


         Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the Dollar Equivalent of
         such amount, in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the day
         on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter
         referred to as the "Judgment Currency Conversion Date").

                           (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange
         prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date
         of actual payment of the amount due, the Parent Borrower and each
         Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, covenants and agrees
         to pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if any (but in
         any event not a lesser amount), as may be necessary to ensure that the
         amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate of
         exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of
         the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount
         of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial award at
