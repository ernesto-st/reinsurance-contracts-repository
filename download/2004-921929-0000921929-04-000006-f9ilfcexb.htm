         <b><u>ARTICLE 4</u></b>             <b><u>PLACE AND DATE OF DELIVERY</u></b>

4.1             <b><u>Place of Delivery</u></b>.    LESSOR will deliver the Aircraft to LESSEE at Manufacturer's
facility at Hamburg, Germany or such other place as may be agreed in writing between the parties
(the "<b><u>Delivery Location</u></b>").

4.2             <b><u>Scheduled Delivery Date</u></b>.    As of the date of this Lease, Delivery of the Aircraft
from Manufacturer to LESSOR is scheduled to occur in the month of [SEE PARAGRAPH 1 OF EXHIBIT C.].
LESSOR will notify LESSEE from time to time and in a timely manner but no later than ninety (90)
days prior to the scheduled month of delivery of the scheduled week of delivery and no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the exact date on which LESSOR expects Delivery to take place (the
"<b><u>Scheduled Delivery Date</u></b>").

4.3             <b><u>Delivery Subject to Manufacturer Delivery</u></b>.    Subject to the provisions of this
Article 3, LESSOR and LESSEE expressly acknowledge that Delivery of the Aircraft to LESSEE is
subject to and conditioned upon delivery of the Aircraft by Manufacturer to LESSOR.

4.4             <b><u>No LESSOR Liability</u></b>.    LESSOR will not be liable for any loss or expense, or
any loss of profit, arising from any delay or failure in Delivery to LESSEE unless such delay or
failure arises as a direct consequence of the willful misconduct of LESSOR or the breach by
LESSOR of its obligations under the purchase agreement with respect to the Aircraft, and in no
event will LESSOR be liable for any delay or failure which is caused by any breach or delay on
the part of Manufacturer or any BFE supplier.

4.5             <b><u>Total Loss of Aircraft Prior to Delivery</u></b>.    If a Total Loss of the Aircraft
occurs prior to Delivery, neither party will have any further liability to the other except
that LESSOR will return to LESSEE the Security Deposit in accordance with ARTICLE 5.1.3 and
any prepaid Rent, whereupon this Lease shall terminate.

4.6             <b><u>Cancellation for Delay</u></b>.

4.6.1    Promptly after LESSOR becomes aware that in Manufacturer's opinion a delay will cause
                Delivery to be delayed beyond [SEE PARAGRAPH 2 OF EXHIBIT C.] (the "<b><u>Outside</u></b>
                <b><u>Delivery Date</u></b>"), LESSOR will notify LESSEE.  By written notice given within
                thirty (30) days after the first to occur of (i) LESSEE's receipt of such
                LESSOR notice or (ii) the Outside Delivery Date, either party may by written
                notice to the other party terminate this Lease and this Lease will terminate
                on the date of receipt of such notice, provided however that LESSOR shall not
                so terminate this Lease unless it has cancelled its purchase of the Aircraft
                from the Manufacturer.  If neither party gives notice of termination within
                such thirty (30) day period, then the period for termination shall be deemed
                to be extended for an additional one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
                expiration of such thirty (30) day period.  In the event that neither party
                gives a notice of termination within such one hundred and eighty (180) day
                period, the Lease will automatically terminate upon the expiration of such
                period, and LESSOR will return to LESSEE the Security Deposit and any prepaid
                Rent as provided above.

4.6.2    In the event that Delivery is delayed more than sixty (60) days beyond the Scheduled
                Delivery Date due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of LESSOR,
                LESSEE shall have the right to terminate this Lease by written notice to LESSOR,
                and this Lease will terminate on the date that is thirty (30) days after LESSOR's
                receipt of such notice of termination.

4.6.3    In the event of any termination of this Lease pursuant to Article 3.6.1 or Article
                3.6.2, neither party will have any further liability to the other party except
                that LESSOR will return to LESSEE the Security Deposit in accordance with
                ARTICLE 5.1.3 and any prepaid Rent.

4.7             <b><u>Delay</u></b>.    In the event that the Delivery of the Aircraft is delayed beyond
the Scheduled Delivery Date, then LESSEE and LESSOR will meet to discuss the action that they
will take against Manufacturer or any vendor as a result of such delay and what compensation
they desire from the Manufacturer or such vendor.  In the event that LESSOR receives compensation
from Manufacturer as a result of any delay, LESSOR after deducting its costs and expenses
resulting from such delay will provide to LESSEE the balance of such compensation received from
Manufacturer.  In the event that LESSOR receives an abatement or other concession by Manufacturer
in respect of Manufacturer's Escalation Rate as a result of any delay, LESSOR will pass through
such abatement or concession to LESSEE.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 5</u></b>             <b><u>LEASE TERM</u></b>


5.1             <b><u>Lease Term</u></b>.    The term of leasing of the Aircraft will commence on the
Delivery Date and continue for a term of [SEE PARAGRAPH 3 OF EXHIBIT C.] ("<b><u>Lease Term</u></b>").

5.2             "<b><u>Expiration Date</u></b>.    "<b><u>Expiration Date</u></b>" means the date on which LESSEE is
required to redeliver the Aircraft to LESSOR in the condition required by this Lease on the
last day of the Lease Term.

5.3             "<b><u>Termination Date</u></b>.    If LESSEE returns the Aircraft to LESSOR on the
Expiration Date in the condition required by Article 23, then "<b><u>Termination Date</u></b>" has the same
meaning as "Expiration Date".  If LESSEE does not do so, then "<b><u>Termination Date</u></b>" means the date
on which the first of the following events occurs:

                (a)    there is a Total Loss of the Aircraft prior to Delivery pursuant to
                Article 3.5;

                (b)    cancellation of this Lease occurs pursuant to Article 3.6;

                (c)    there is a Total Loss of the Aircraft and payment is made to LESSOR in
                accordance with Article 19.3;

                (d)    an Event of Default occurs and LESSOR repossesses the Aircraft or
                otherwise terminates this Lease pursuant to Article 25.3 prior to the
                Expiration Date and recovers possession and control of the Aircraft;

                (e)    an Event of Default occurs hereunder due to LESSEE returning the
                Aircraft after the Expiration Date in the condition required by this Lease; or

                (f)    an Event of Default occurs and LESSOR repossesses the Aircraft or
                otherwise terminates this Lease pursuant to Article 25.3 after the Expiration
                Date and recovers possession and control of the Aircraft.

6.5             <b><u>[Redacted]</u></b>.    SEE PARAGRAPH 8 OF EXHIBIT C.

6.6             <b><u>LESSOR's Bank Account</u></b>.    The Security Deposit, Transaction Fee, Rent,
Reserves and any other payment due under this Lease will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. Dollar funds to LESSOR's bank account at:

                       International Lease Finance Corporation
                       Account No. 910-274-9067

                       ABA# 021000021

or to such other bank account as LESSOR may from time to time designate by written notice
("<b><u>LESSOR's Bank</u></b>").  When it is stated in this Lease that an installment of the Security Deposit,
the monthly Rent, Reserves or any other payment is due or must be paid or made by LESSEE by a
specific date, then such payment actually must be received by LESSOR's Bank on or before such
specific date, even if, in order for such payment to be received by LESSOR's Bank by such
specific date, LESSEE must initiate the wire transfer prior to such specific date.

6.7             <b><u>Default Interest</u></b>.    If LESSOR's Bank does not receive the Rent or any other
amount on or before the specific date when due, LESSOR will suffer loss and damage the exact
nature and amount of which are difficult or impossible to ascertain.  LESSEE will pay LESSOR
as supplemental Rent (by way of agreed compensation and not as a penalty) interest on any due
and unpaid amounts payable by LESSEE under this Lease calculated at a per annum rate (based on
a 360 day year) equal to [SEE PARAGRAPH 9 OF EXHIBIT C.] plus the Prime Rate in effect on the
date on which the amount was originally due for the period from the date the amount originally
was due through the date the amount actually is received at LESSOR's Bank or, in the case of
LESSOR's performance of LESSEE's obligations hereunder, from the date of payment by LESSOR
through the date of LESSEE's repayment to LESSOR ("<b><u>Default Interest</u></b>"). Default Interest will
accrue on a day-to-day basis and be compounded monthly.

6.8             <b><u>No Deductions or Withholdings</u></b>.    Provided that LESSOR has not breached its
covenant of quiet enjoyment as set forth in Article 21.2, all payments by LESSEE under this
Lease, including the Security Deposit, Transaction Fee, Rent, Reserves, Default Interest, fees,
indemnities or any other item, will be made in full without any deduction or withholding whether
in respect of set-off, counterclaim, duties, or Taxes (as defined in Article 16) imposed in the
State of Registration or any jurisdiction from which such payments are made except to the extent
otherwise required by Law, in which event LESSEE will pay any additional amount such that the net
payment received by LESSOR after any required deduction or withholding equals the amount that
LESSOR would have received if such withholding had not been required; provided, however, that if
LESSEE pays any such additional amount to compensate for the withholding of any LESSOR Taxes,
LESSOR shall pay to LESSEE promptly after receipt of LESSEE's written request therefor (which
request shall include a description in reasonable detail of the LESSOR Taxes involved and the
calculation of the amounts to be paid) such amounts as are necessary so that the net additional
amounts received by LESSOR under this Article 5.8 do not exceed the amounts that LESSOR would
have received if no amounts in respect of LESSOR Taxes had been required to be withheld or
deducted by LESSEE.

6.9             <b><u>Value Added Taxes</u></b>.    The Rent and other amounts payable by LESSEE under this
Lease are exclusive of any value added tax, turnover tax or similar tax or duty.

6.10            <b><u>Wire Transfer Disbursement Report</u></b>.    At the time of each Rent or other payment,
LESSEE will advise LESSOR in writing of the amount of the payment being made by LESSEE and the
allocation of such payment to the Security Deposit, Rent, Reserves, Default Interest and other
charges.  Notwithstanding the allocation set forth in LESSEE's report, in the event an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing under this Lease, LESSOR will have complete discretion
to allocate LESSEE's payments as LESSOR determines.

6.11            <b><u>Net Lease</u></b>.

6.11.1          This Lease is a net lease and LESSEE's obligation to pay Rent and make other
                payments in accordance with this Lease will be absolute and unconditional under
                any and all circumstances and regardless of other events, including the following:

                (a)    any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
                (including any right of reimbursement) which LESSEE may have against LESSOR,
                Manufacturer, the Engine manufacturer or any other person for any reason,
                including any claim LESSEE may have for the foregoing;

                (b)    unavailability or interruption in use of the Aircraft for any reason,
                including a requisition thereof or any prohibition or interference with or other
                restriction against LESSEE's use, operation or possession of the Aircraft (whether
                by Law or otherwise), any defect in title, airworthiness, merchantability, fitness
                for any purpose, condition, design, specification or operation of any kind or
                nature of the Aircraft, the ineligibility of the Aircraft for any particular use
                or trade or for registration under the Laws of any jurisdiction or Total Loss
                of the Aircraft;

                (c)    insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt,
                dissolution, liquidation, receivership, administration or similar proceedings by
                or against LESSOR, LESSEE, Manufacturer, the Engine manufacturer or any other Person;

                (d)    invalidity or unenforceability or lack of due authorization of or other
                defect in this Lease;

                (e)    failure or delay on the part of any party to perform its obligations
                under this Lease; or

                (f)    any other circumstance which but for this provision would or might have
                the effect of terminating or in any other way affecting any obligation of LESSEE
                hereunder.

6.11.2          Nothing in Article 5.11 will be construed (a) to limit LESSEE's rights and
                remedies in the event of LESSOR's breach of its warranty of quiet enjoyment set
                forth in Article 21.2 or LESSOR's breach of its warranty of U.S. citizenship set
                forth in Article 21.3 or (b) to limit LESSEE's rights and remedies to institute
                legal or other proceedings or pursue any claim it may have against LESSOR or
                any other Person; provided, however, that LESSEE will have no obligation to pay
                Rent as aforesaid, except in respect of Rent accrued at the time, for the number
                of days that LESSEE is deprived of the possession and use of the Aircraft as the
                result of the breach by LESSOR of its warranty of quiet enjoyment obligations set
                forth Article 21.2.

6.12            <b><u>LESSOR Performance of LESSEE Obligation</u></b>.    If LESSEE fails to make any payment
due under this Lease to a third party in connection with the Aircraft or fails to perform any
other obligation required under this Lease, LESSOR may (but is not required to) at its election
and without waiver of its rights perform such obligation and/or pay such amount.

6.12.1          <u>LESSEE's Right to Contest in Good Faith</u>.    Notwithstanding the terms of Article
         5.12, if LESSEE reasonably contests its obligation to make a payment to a third party,
         LESSOR will not exercise its right to make such payment so long as (i) no other Event
         of Default under this Lease exists and is continuing, (ii) no Security Interest in the
         Aircraft (other than Permitted Liens) has arisen as a result of such non-payment, and
         (iii) there is no significant risk of prejudice to any of the rights or interests of
         LESSOR or any LESSOR's Lender with respect to the Aircraft or the Lease as a result
         of such non-payment.

6.12.2          <u>LESSOR's Right to Repayment</u>.     Within five (5) Business Days after written
         notice to LESSEE of the amount paid by LESSOR on behalf of LESSEE pursuant to Article
         5.12, LESSEE will repay such amount to LESSOR together with Default Interest. Such
         payment to LESSOR will constitute additional Rent payable by LESSEE to LESSOR hereunder.
         Any payment, performance or compliance by LESSOR of a LESSEE obligation hereunder will
         not affect the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default.

6.13            <u>Consideration for Rent and Other Amounts</u>.    The amount of the Rent and other
         payments contained herein are in consideration of LESSEE's waiver of warranties and
         indemnities set forth in Articles 8 and 17, respectively, and the other provisions of
         this Lease.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 7</u></b>            <b><u>INVOLVEMENT WITH AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER</u></b>


7.1             <b><u>LESSEE Selection of Aircraft</u></b>.    LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE
AIRCRAFT SET FORTH IN THIS LEASE IS BASED UPON INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY MANUFACTURER.  LESSEE
COVENANTS TO LESSOR THAT LESSEE HAS USED ITS OWN JUDGMENT IN SELECTING THE AIRCRAFT AND HAS DONE
SO BASED ON ITS SIZE, DESIGN AND TYPE.  LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LESSOR IS NOT A MANUFACTURER,
REPAIRER OR SERVICING AGENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

7.2             <b><u>Participation Agreement</u></b>.    LESSEE shall have the right to inspect the Aircraft
during the manufacture process and to attend and observe the acceptance tests of the Aircraft
pursuant to the terms of a Participation Agreement to be entered into between LESSEE and LESSOR
in the form set forth in Exhibit D.

7.3             <b><u>Procurement of BFE</u></b>.    LESSEE's and LESSOR's technical representatives will
meet and determine which of LESSEE or LESSOR will provide specific items of BFE.  Such BFE will
then be provided to Manufacturer by LESSEE or LESSOR, as applicable, within the time frames
required by Manufacturer.

7.4             <b><u>LESSEE Inspection of Aircraft</u></b>.    During the course of final assembly of the
Aircraft, and at Delivery, LESSEE may have its own representative present to inspect the Aircraft
and to ensure its conformity with LESSEE's needs and the terms of this Lease.  LESSEE will have
ground inspection and acceptance flight rights with respect to the Aircraft.  If LESSEE's
inspection reveals that the Aircraft does not comply in any respect with the terms of this Lease,
LESSOR will (for its own behalf and at LESSEE's request) promptly cause the Manufacturer to
correct any such defects and make the Aircraft available for reinspection to LESSEE, and to
conduct such further demonstration flights as may be necessary to verify compliance with the
requirements of this Lease, including but not limited to Exhibit A attached hereto.  LESSEE
acknowledges that, as between LESSEE and LESSOR, in accepting the Aircraft LESSEE is relying
on its own inspection and knowledge of the Aircraft in determining whether the Aircraft meets
the requirements of this Lease.

7.5             <b><u>Aircraft at Delivery</u></b>.    At Delivery, the Aircraft will be as set forth in
Exhibit A, as such description may be modified by any change requests agreed to among LESSEE,
LESSOR and Manufacturer (which will be reflected in amendment(s) to this Lease).  In the event
of any discrepancies, LESSEE and LESSOR will cooperate in good faith with one another and with
Manufacturer and Engine manufacturer, as applicable, in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable
resolution of any such discrepancies.

7.6             <b><u>Delivery of the Aircraft to LESSEE</u></b>.    Subject to LESSEE having performed all
of the conditions precedent to Delivery set forth herein, immediately following delivery of the
Aircraft from Manufacturer to LESSOR, LESSOR will tender the Aircraft to LESSEE at the Delivery
Location.  Provided that the Aircraft is in the condition required by Article 6.5 and provided
that LESSOR shall have performed all conditions precedent noted in Article 7.2 hereof, upon the
tender of the Aircraft by LESSOR to LESSEE, LESSEE will accept the Aircraft by executing and
delivering to LESSOR the Estoppel and Acceptance Certificate, whereupon Delivery will be deemed
to have occurred for all purposes under this Lease (hereinafter, "Delivery"), including, but not
limited to, the commencement of LESSEE's obligation to pay Rent hereunder.

7.7             <b><u>LESSEE Acceptance of Aircraft</u></b>.    If LESSEE fails to (a) comply with the
conditions contained in Articles 7.1 and 7.3 so as to allow Delivery to take place immediately
following delivery of the Aircraft by Manufacturer to LESSOR or (b) take delivery of the Aircraft
when properly tendered for delivery by LESSOR in the condition required hereunder, LESSEE will
indemnify LESSOR for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by LESSOR as a
direct result thereof including (but without limitation) any payments other than the purchase
price which LESSOR becomes obliged to make to Manufacturer.

AND EXECUTION OF THE ESTOPPEL AND ACCEPTANCE CERTIFICATE.  AFTER SUCH TIME, THEN AS BETWEEN
LESSOR AND LESSEE:

9.1             "<b><u>As Is, Where Is</u></b>.    LESSEE AGREES THAT IT IS LEASING THE AIRCRAFT "AS IS,
WHERE IS".  LESSEE UNCONDITIONALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NEITHER LESSOR NOR ANY OF ITS
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE MADE OR WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY
TERM, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (WHETHER STATUTORY OR
OTHERWISE) AS TO (a) THE CAPACITY, AGE, AIRWORTHINESS, VALUE, QUALITY, DURABILITY, CONFORMITY

ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE OR (d) ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY PART THEREOF,
ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED AND EXTINGUISHED EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN

LESSEE MAY HAVE AGAINST LESSOR BASED UPON THE FAILURE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO CONFORM WITH SUCH
DESCRIPTION AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 10508
THROUGH 10522 OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL CODE.  EVEN IF AT ANY TIME THE FAILURE OF THE
AIRCRAFT TO CONFORM TO SUCH DESCRIPTION SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRS THE VALUE AND UTILITY OF THE
AIRCRAFT AND EITHER (i) LESSEE ACCEPTED THE AIRCRAFT BASED ON A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION THAT
THE NONCONFORMITY WOULD BE CURED AND IT WAS NOT SEASONABLY CURED OR (ii) LESSEE ACCEPTED THE

THE FAILURE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO CONFORM TO SUCH DESCRIPTION.

9.3             <b><u>LESSEE Waiver</u></b>.    LESSEE hereby waives as between itself and LESSOR and agrees
not to seek to establish or enforce any rights and remedies, express or implied (whether statutory
or otherwise) against LESSOR or the Aircraft relating to any of the matters mentioned in Articles
8.1 or 8.2 and the leasing thereof by LESSOR to LESSEE.

9.4             <b><u>Conclusive Proof</u></b>.    DELIVERY BY LESSEE TO LESSOR OF THE ESTOPPEL AND ACCEPTANCE

HAVE EXAMINED AND INVESTIGATED THE AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING THE ENGINES AND THE AIRCRAFT DOCUMENTATION
AND THAT EACH IS IN THE CONDITION REQUIRED HEREUNDER (EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN SUCH
CERTIFICATE), AND OTHERWISE IN EVERY WAY SATISFACTORY TO LESSEE.

9.5             <b><u>No LESSOR Liability for Losses</u></b>.    LESSEE agrees that LESSOR will not be liable
to LESSEE, any sublessee or any Person, whether in contract or tort and however arising, for

whether or not due in whole or in part to an act or omission or the active or passive negligence
of LESSOR.

9.6             <b><u>No Liability to Repair or Replace</u></b>.    LESSOR will not be liable for any expense
in repairing or replacing any item of the Aircraft or be liable to supply another aircraft or

destroyed or otherwise rendered unfit for use.

9.7             <b><u>No Waiver</u></b>.    Nothing in this Article 8 or elsewhere in this Lease will be deemed
to be a waiver by LESSEE of any rights it may have against Manufacturer, the Engine manufacturer

<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 19; page: 19" -->


         <b><u>ARTICLE 10</u></b>           <b><u>MANUFACTURERS' AND VENDORS' WARRANTIES</u></b>


10.1            <b><u>Warranties</u></b>.    Effective upon Delivery LESSOR will assign to LESSEE for the
duration of the Lease Term the benefit of all warranties and indemnities given to LESSOR by
Manufacturer and the Engine manufacturer pursuant to the Airframe Warranty Assignment and the
Engine Warranty Assignment, respectively.  Effective on the Delivery Date, all other assignable
vendor warranties with respect to the Aircraft are hereby assigned by LESSOR to LESSEE.

10.2            <b><u>Non-Assignable Warranties</u></b>.    To the extent that any warranty or indemnity given
to LESSOR by Manufacturer and others with respect to the Aircraft cannot be assigned, LESSEE
will be entitled to take such action to enforce such warranty or indemnity in the name of
LESSOR against Manufacturer and such other parties as LESSEE sees fit (and, notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary in Article 8.3, LESSOR will reasonably cooperate with LESSEE in
pursuit of the same), but subject to LESSEE first ensuring that LESSOR is indemnified and secured
to LESSOR's reasonable satisfaction against all losses, damage, costs, expenses and liabilities
thereby incurred or reasonably likely to be incurred.

10.3            <b><u>Reassignment</u></b>.    On the Termination Date, the benefit of any warranty assigned
by LESSOR to LESSEE will be reassigned automatically to LESSOR or its designee.  LESSEE's rights
to receive payment under any such warranties will revert to LESSOR during any period in which
an Event of Default is continuing.  LESSEE at its own cost and expense will do all such things
and execute such documents as may be reasonably required for this purpose.

10.4            <b><u>Warranty Claims</u></b>.    LESSEE will diligently and promptly pursue any valid claims
it may have against Manufacturer and others under such warranties with respect to the Aircraft.
If there are any outstanding warranty claims at the time of return, LESSEE will provide notice
of the same to LESSOR.


<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 20; page: 20" -->


         <b><u>ARTICLE 11</u></b>           <b><u>OPERATION OF AIRCRAFT</u></b>


11.1            <b><u>Costs of Operation</u></b>.    LESSEE will pay all costs incurred in the operation of
the Aircraft during the Lease Term, for profit or otherwise, including the costs of flight crews,
cabin personnel, fuel, oil, lubricants, maintenance, insurance, storage, landing and navigation
fees, airport charges, passenger service and any and all other expenses of any kind or nature,
directly or indirectly, in connection with or related to the use, movement and operation of the
Aircraft.  The obligations, covenants and liabilities of LESSEE under this paragraph arising
prior to return of the Aircraft to LESSOR will continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding
the termination of this Lease or expiration of the Lease Term.

11.2            <b><u>Compliance with Laws</u></b>.    Except as expressly provided in this Lease, LESSEE
agrees throughout the Lease Term to maintain operational control of the Aircraft and use the
Aircraft in accordance with applicable Laws of the State of Registration and of any country,
state, territory or municipality into or over which LESSEE may operate the Aircraft.  LESSEE
will not employ, suffer or cause the Aircraft to be used in any business which is forbidden
by Law or in any manner which will render it liable to condemnation, destruction, seizure, or
confiscation by any authority.  Unless due to emergency, LESSEE will not permit the Aircraft
to fly to any airport or country if so doing would cause LESSEE to be in violation of any Law
applicable to LESSEE or the Aircraft.

11.3            <b><u>Training</u></b>.    LESSEE will not use the Aircraft for testing or for training of
flight crew members other than LESSEE crew members or as otherwise may be required by the
Aviation Authority and, from and after the date on which it obtains other A319 aircraft, it
will not use the Aircraft for training any more than it utilizes for training the other A319
aircraft in its fleet.

11.4            <b><u>No Violation of Insurance Policies</u></b>.    LESSEE will not use or permit the Aircraft
to be used in any manner or for any purpose which is not covered by the insurance policies LESSEE
is required to carry and maintain as set forth in this Lease.  LESSEE will not carry any goods of
any description excepted or exempted from such policies or do any other act or permit to be done
anything which could reasonably be expected by LESSEE to invalidate or limit any such insurance
policy.

11.5            Flight Charges.    LESSEE will pay promptly when due all en route navigation
charges, navigation service charges and all other charges payable by LESSEE for the use of or
for services provided at any airport, whether in respect of the Aircraft or any other aircraft
of LESSEE, and will indemnify and hold LESSOR harmless in respect of the same.  This indemnity
will continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the
Lease Term for any reason or the return of the Aircraft.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 12</u></b>           <b><u>SUBLEASES</u></b>


12.1            <b><u>No Sublease without LESSOR Consent</u></b>.    LESSEE WILL NOT SUBLEASE OR PART WITH
POSSESSION OF THE AIRCRAFT (EXCEPT FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR) AT ANY TIME WITHOUT THE PRIOR
WRITTEN CONSENT OF LESSOR (NOT TO BE UNREASONABLY WITHHELD OR DELAYED) EXCEPT FOR A SUBLEASE
TO A PERMITTED SUBLESSEE PRE-APPROVED IN ARTICLE 11.1.1 BELOW, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH
REQUIREMENTS AS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE AGREED IN WRITING BETWEEN LESSOR AND LESSEE.  The wet
leasing of the Aircraft during the Lease Term (in which LESSEE and its crews retain operational
control of the Aircraft) will not be considered a sublease of the Aircraft.

12.1.1          LESSEE may sublease the Aircraft without LESSOR's prior consent to any operator
                which is then currently a lessee of LESSOR ("<b><u>Permitted Sublessee</u></b>"), provided
                that such operator is not then in default and has not been in default at any
                time during the preceding ninety (90) days under any aircraft lease agreement
                between such operator and LESSOR.  Any such sublease will be subject to the
                provisions of this Article 11, including the provisions of Article 11.2 below.

12.2            <b><u>LESSOR Costs</u></b>.    LESSEE will indemnify LESSOR on demand for all reasonable and
actual out-of-pocket expenses (including legal fees) incurred in connection with LESSOR's
assessment of the subleasing proposal (whether or not LESSOR's consent to such sublease is
ultimately given), review of the sublease documentation and implementation of the sublease.

12.3            <b><u>Any Approved Sublease</u></b>.    Any sublease to a Permitted Sublessee, and any other
sublease approved by LESSOR will be for a term no greater than the remaining Lease Term and
contain provisions consistent with this Lease protecting LESSOR's title to the Aircraft,
providing appropriate LESSOR indemnities, regarding the maintenance and repair standards for
the Aircraft, concerning the insurances which will be carried by the sublessee and the
circumstances which constitute a Total Loss of the Aircraft.  Any such sublease will be subject
and subordinate to this Lease.  In its sole discretion, LESSOR may require an opinion of counsel
in connection with such sublease, including LESSOR's right to repossess the Aircraft in the event
of an Event of Default hereunder or under the sublease.  LESSEE will not amend the terms of any
approved sublease which, if so amended, would have a material adverse effect on LESSOR's right,
title or interest in the Aircraft or this Lease, without the prior written consent of LESSOR,
which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
LESSOR agrees that even if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder, so long
as the approved sublessee fully performs all of the obligations of LESSEE hereunder and agrees
to do so on a going forward basis and there is no risk to LESSOR of an impairment to LESSOR's
unencumbered title to the Aircraft, LESSOR will not interfere with such sublessee's quiet use
and enjoyment of the Aircraft.

12.4            <b><u>Assignment of Sublease</u></b>.    Any approved sublease will be assigned to LESSOR as
security for LESSEE's obligations under this Lease.  LESSEE will deliver the original counterpart
of the sublease to LESSOR and make any filings necessary to protect LESSOR's security interest.

12.5            <b><u>Wet Leases</u></b>.    The wet leasing of the Aircraft during the Lease Term (in which
LESSEE and its crews retain operational control of the Aircraft) will not be considered a sublease
of the Aircraft and will be permitted without LESSOR's consent, provided that (a) the Aircraft
remains registered in the State of Registration, (b) the Aircraft will neither be based in nor
operated in or to a Prohibited Country, (c) LESSEE provides LESSOR with either (i) a certified
copy of the applicable provisions from the wet lease agreement, (ii) a certified copy or original
of an insurance certificate confirming the maintenance of insurance coverage as required by
Article 18 and Exhibit E, or (iii) an officer's certificate indicating whether LESSEE or the wet
lessee will be responsible for maintaining the primary passenger, baggage and cargo liability
insurance relating to operation under the wet lease, and (d) LESSEE complies with Article 18.8.

12.6            Continued Responsibility of LESSEE.    LESSEE will continue to be responsible
or performance of its obligations under this Lease during any period of sublease.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 13</u></b>           <b><u>MAINTENANCE OF AIRCRAFT</u></b>


13.1            <b><u>General Obligation</u></b>.

13.1.1          During the Lease Term and until the Aircraft is returned to LESSOR in the
                condition required by this Lease, LESSEE alone has the obligation, at its
                expense, to maintain and repair the Aircraft, Engines, and all of the Parts (a)
                in accordance with the Maintenance Program, (b) in accordance with the rules
                and regulations of the Aviation Authority, (c) in accordance with Manufacturer's
                type design, (d) in accordance with any other regulations or requirements
                necessary in order to maintain a valid Certificate of Airworthiness for the
                Aircraft and meet the requirements at all times during the Lease Term and upon
                return of the Aircraft to LESSOR for issuance of a Standard Certificate of
                Airworthiness for transport category aircraft issued by the FAA in accordance
                with FAR Part 21 (except during those periods when (i) the Aircraft is undergoing
                maintenance, Overhaul, modification, or repairs as required or permitted by this
                Lease and to the extent in conflict with the requirements of the Aviation Authority
                or (ii) the Aircraft type has been grounded by the FAA, the DGAC or other
                applicable Aviation Authority) and (e) in the same manner and with the same care
                as used by LESSEE with respect to similar aircraft and engines operated by LESSEE
                and without in any way discriminating against the Aircraft.

13.1.2          No Engine will remain in an unserviceable condition for more than three (3) months.

13.1.3          [SEE PARAGRAPH 10 OF EXHIBIT C.]

13.1.4          [SEE PARAGRAPH 11 OF EXHIBIT C.]

13.1.5          LESSEE will not enter into any Engine maintenance cost per flight hour, power-
                by-the-hour or similar agreement with respect to the Engines ("MCPH Agreement")
                with the Engine manufacturer or any other Engine maintenance facility or
                organization without LESSOR's prior written consent, which shall not be
                unreasonably withheld.  At a minimum, any MCPH Agreement must provide that the
                MCPH provider will not place or enforce any lien upon any Engine covered by the
                MCPH program for any amounts owed by LESSEE.  In all events, LESSEE will at its
                cost be responsible for performing all work necessary to meet the return conditions
                with respect to the Engines set forth in Article 23 even if such work is not
                covered by LESSEE's MCPH Agreement.

13.2            <b><u>Specific Obligations</u></b>.    Without limiting Article 12.1, LESSEE agrees that such
maintenance and repairs will include but will not be limited to each of the following specific
items:

                and non-routine maintenance work;

                applicable to the Aircraft;

                (c)    incorporation in the Aircraft of all alert service bulletins of Manufacturer,
                Engine manufacturer and other vendors or manufacturers of Parts installed on the
                Aircraft which are applicable to the Aircraft and any service bulletins which
                must be performed in order to maintain the warranties on the Aircraft, Engines,
                and Parts;

                (d)    [SEE PARAGRAPH 12 OF EXHIBIT C.]

                (e)    compliance with a corrosion prevention and control program including the
                correction of any discrepancies in accordance with the Maintenance Program.  In
                addition, all inspected areas will be properly treated with corrosion inhibitor
                in accordance with the Maintenance Program;

                (f)    maintaining in English and keeping in an up-to-date status the records

                tags from the manufacturer of such Part or a repair facility which evidence
                that such Part is new or overhauled and establish authenticity in accordance
                with FAA requirements, total time in service and time since overhaul for such
                Part), the hours and cycles the Aircraft and Engines operate and all maintenance
                and repairs performed on the Aircraft; and

                (h)    properly documenting all repairs, Modifications and alterations and the
                addition, removal or replacement of equipment, systems or components in accordance
                with the rules and regulations of the Aviation Authority and reflecting such items
                in the Aircraft Documentation.  In addition, all repairs to the Aircraft will be
                accomplished in accordance with either (i) Manufacturer's Structural Repair Manual
                (or DGAC-approved Repair Approval Sheets) or (ii) FAA-approved data (such as FAA
                Form 8110 or equivalent).  All Modifications and alterations will be accomplished
                in accordance with FAA-approved data (such as FAA Form 8110 or equivalent).

13.3            <b><u>Replacement of Parts</u></b>.

13.3.1          LESSEE, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may
                from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated,
                damaged beyond repair or rendered unfit or beyond economical repair (BER) for
                use for any reason.  In the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair,
                overhaul or testing, LESSEE may remove any Part provided that LESSEE replaces
                such Part as promptly as practicable.  All replacement Parts will (a) be free
                and clear of all Security Interests (except Permitted Liens) of any kind or
                description, (b) be in condition approved for return to service and of at least
                equivalent model, service bulletin and modification status and have a value and
                utility at least equal to the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were
                in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof and
               (c) have a current "serviceable tag" of the manufacturer or maintenance facility
                providing such items to LESSEE, indicating that such Parts are new, serviceable
                or Overhauled. So long as a substitution meets the requirements of the Maintenance
                Program and the Aviation Authority, LESSEE may substitute for any Part a part
                that does not meet the requirements of the foregoing sentence if a complying Part
                cannot be procured or installed within the available ground time of the Aircraft
                and as soon as practicable the noncomplying part is removed and replaced by a
                complying Part.  With respect to replacement modules in an Engine, (x) the life
                limited Part that is due to be removed earliest in such replacement module will
                have no less life remaining than the life limited Part that is due to be removed
                earliest in the replaced module and (y) the average life remaining for all life
                limited Parts in the replacement module will be no less than the average life
                remaining for the life limited Parts in the replaced module.

13.3.2          All Parts removed from the Airframe or any Engine will remain the property of
                LESSOR and subject to this Lease no matter where located, until such time as
                such Parts have been replaced by Parts (which have been incorporated or installed
                in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine) which meet the requirements for
                replacement Parts specified above and title to such replacement Parts has passed
                to LESSOR under the Laws of the State of Registration and <i>lex situs</i>.  To the
                extent permitted by the Laws of the State of Registration and the lex situs it
                is the intent of LESSOR and LESSEE that without further act and immediately upon
                any replacement Part becoming incorporated, installed or attached to the Airframe
                or an Engine as above provided, (a) title to the removed Part will thereupon vest
                in LESSEE, free and clear of all rights of LESSOR and LESSOR's Liens, (b) title
                to the replacement Part will thereupon vest in LESSOR free and clear of all rights
                of LESSEE (other than LESSEE's rights under this Lease) and (c) such replacement
                Part will become subject to this Lease and be deemed to be a Part hereunder to
                the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached
                to the Airframe or such Engine.

13.4            <b><u>Removal of Engines</u></b>.

13.4.1          If an Engine is removed for testing, service, repair, maintenance, Overhaul work,
                alterations or modifications, title to such Engine will at all times remain
                vested in LESSOR.

13.4.2          LESSEE will be entitled to remove any of the Engines from the Aircraft and
                install another engine or engines on the Aircraft, provided that LESSEE complies
                with each of the following obligations:

                (a)    the insurance requirements set forth in Article 18 and Exhibit E are
                in place;

                (b)    LESSEE ensures that the identification plates referred to in Article 15
                are not removed from any Engine upon such Engine being detached from the Aircraft;
                and

                (c)    title to the Engine remains with LESSOR free from all Security Interests
                (except Permitted Liens) regardless of the location of the Engine or its
                attachment to or detachment from the Aircraft.

13.5            <b><u>Pooling of Engines and Parts</u></b>.    LESSEE may subject the Engines and Parts to
normal interchange or pooling agreements with responsible international scheduled commercial
air carriers customary in the airline industry and entered into by LESSEE in the ordinary
course of its business with respect to its entire Airbus narrow body (A318, A319, A320 and/or
A321) fleet so long as (a) in the case of pooling of an Engine, such Engine is returned to
LESSEE within four (4) months, (b) no transfer of title to the Engine occurs, (c) all other
terms of this Lease continue to be observed with respect to the Engines or Parts, including but
not limited to Articles 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 and (d) LESSEE continues to be
fully responsible to LESSOR for the performance of all of its obligations hereunder.

13.6            <b><u>Installation of Engines on Other aircraft</u></b>.    Any Engine removed from the
Aircraft may be installed on another aircraft in LESSEE's fleet which utilizes engines of the
same type as the Engine only if one of the situations described in this Article 12.6 exists:

13.6.1          LESSEE or LESSOR has title to such other aircraft free and clear of all
                Security Interests (except Permitted Liens).

13.6.2          LESSEE, LESSOR and all of the Creditors of LESSEE of such aircraft enter into
                an engines cooperation agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
                LESSOR in which each party agrees to recognize one another's rights in the engines.
                LESSEE will reimburse LESSOR and LESSOR's Lender for their reasonable attorneys'
                fees and costs in negotiating and finalizing engine cooperation agreement
                arrangements with LESSEE and its Creditors.

13.6.3          Such other aircraft is subject to a Creditor Agreement (but no other Security
                Interests except Permitted Liens) which by its terms expressly or effectively
                states that such Creditor and its successors and assigns will not acquire any
                right, title or interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine being installed
                on such aircraft.   LESSEE hereby agrees that if LESSOR's title to an Engine
                is in fact impaired under any such Creditor Agreement, such impairment will be
                deemed to be a Total Loss of such Engine and the provisions of Article 19.5 will
                apply unless, no later than thirty (30) days after the impairment arose, (a)
                the impairment has ceased to exist or (b) LESSEE has provided LESSOR with a bond,
                bank guarantee, or other form of protection acceptable to LESSOR in its sole
                discretion.  To the extent another Creditor Agreement contains such provisions,
                then LESSOR hereby agrees for the benefit of the Creditor of such Creditor
                Agreement that neither LESSOR nor its successors or assigns will acquire or
                claim any right, title or interest in any engine in which LESSEE or another
                Creditor has an interest as a result of such engine being installed on the
                Airframe.

13.7            <b><u>Engine Thrust Rating</u></b>.    No Engine shall be utilized at a thrust rating greater
than the thrust rating set forth in Exhibit A, absent LESSOR's express written consent.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 23; page: 23" -->


13.8            <b><u>Modifications</u></b>.

13.8.1          No modification, alteration, addition, or removal to or from the Aircraft
                ("<b><u>Modification</u></b>") expected to cost over [SEE PARAGRAPH 13 OF EXHIBIT
                C.] or deviation from the Aircraft's original type design or configuration will
                be made without the prior written consent of LESSOR, which consent will not be
                unreasonably withheld or delayed. "Modification" does not include any modification,
                alteration, addition or removal (a) performed in accordance with Airworthiness
                Directives, (b) performed in accordance with recommended or alert service bulletins
                of the Manufacturer or the manufacturer of any Engine or other Part or (c) of any
                Parts which are owned by LESSEE, leased or conditionally sold to LESSEE (other
                than by LESSOR) including, without limitation, entertainment and passenger service
                equipment such as audio-visual equipment, personal computers, fax machines,
                telephones or other communications equipment (collectively, the "<b><u>Passenger Service</u></b>
                <b><u>Equipment</u></b>"), for which LESSOR's consent is not required.

13.8.2          LESSOR may review LESSEE's proposed designs, plans, engineering drawings and
                diagrams, and flight and maintenance manual revisions for any proposed Modification.
                If requested by LESSOR, LESSEE will furnish LESSOR (at LESSEE's expense) with
                such documents in final form and any other documents required by Law, relating to
                such Modification. All Modifications incorporated on the Aircraft will be properly
                documented in the Aircraft Documentation and be fully approved by the Aviation
                Authority.

13.8.3          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, no Modification will be made
                which has the effect of decreasing the utility or value of the Aircraft or
                invalidating any warranty applicable to the Aircraft.

13.8.4          No Modification (except as permitted under Articles 12.8.1(A) and 12.8.1(B))
                will be made by LESSEE if an Event of Default exists and is continuing hereunder.

13.8.5          Unless otherwise agreed by LESSOR in writing, all permanent or structural
                Modifications will forthwith become a part of the Aircraft and LESSEE
                relinquishes to LESSOR all rights and title thereto.  However, all (i) temporary
                and non-structural Modifications and (ii) all Passenger Service Equipment so
                long as such equipment can be removed without causing material damage to the
                Aircraft, will remain the property of LESSEE and, at LESSOR's request and LESSEE's
                cost, will be removed from the Aircraft prior to return of the Aircraft, with
                LESSEE restoring the Aircraft to the condition and configuration it was in prior
                to the Modification or installation of Passenger Service Equipment in a manner
                cosmetically acceptable to LESSOR.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such removal
                will be permitted without LESSOR's permission during the occurrence of an Event
                of Default hereunder and immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
                hereunder, without the requirement of any further act or notice, all right, title
                and interest in such Modifications and Passenger Service Equipment will immediately
                vest in LESSOR; provided however, that in the event of such an Event of Default,
                with respect to any Passenger Service Equipment, LESSOR will use commercially
                reasonable efforts to reach agreement with any vendors or suppliers holding title
                to the Passenger Service Equipment in order to protect the mutual interests of
                LESSOR and such parties.

13.8.6          LESSOR will bear no liability for the cost of Modifications of the Aircraft
                whether in the event of grounding or suspensions of certification, or for any
                other cause.

13.8.7          <u>Inflight Equipment</u>.    LESSOR acknowledges that LESSEE may at any time during
         the Lease Term install on the Aircraft a telephone system and/or a Live TV system or other
         severable equipment for passenger use (collectively, the "Inflight Equipment", which term
         shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, include the video system or any equipment installed
         on the seats at Delivery and purchased and paid for by LESSOR, which shall remain the
         property of LESSOR), which Inflight Equipment may be owned either by LESSEE or by a third
         party provided that:

                (a)    LESSEE shall give LESSOR notice of the installation of any Inflight
                Equipment on the Aircraft and the name and address of the owner of such Inflight
                Equipment (which may be LESSEE), and a copy of the supplementary type certificate
                relating to the installation thereof; and

                (b)    the owner of the Inflight Equipment and LESSOR will enter into an agreement,
                in form and substance reasonably acceptable to LESSEE, which agreement will provide:

                       (i)    that such owner shall not have any lien, security interest, claim
                       or other encumbrance on or against the Aircraft or any Part or Parts thereof,

                       (ii)   that such owner's only right with respect to the Aircraft shall be
                       to remove the Inflight Equipment from the aircraft not later than the earlier
                       of (A) thirty (30) days after notice from LESSOR that it has repossessed
                       the Aircraft because of the occurrence of an Event of Default, and (B)
                       the Lease Termination Date,

                       (iii)  that such right of removal is made subject to and conditional upon
                       such owner, at no expense to LESSOR or to any subsequent owner or operator
                       of the Aircraft, removing and repairing (or causing LESSEE to remove and
                       repair) all alterations made to the Aircraft in connection with the
                       installation of the Inflight Equipment so as to eliminate all evidence of
                       the installation of such Inflight Equipment and to restore the Aircraft to
                       its condition prior to the installation thereof (ordinary wear and tear
                       excepted) in accordance with an Airframe Manufacturer's service bulletin, and

                       (iv)   that such removal and repair shall be conducted at such times and in
                       such a manner as not to interfere in any way with the commercial operation
                       of the Aircraft and completed within the time period set forth in Article
                       12.8.7(B)(II).

13.9            <b><u>Performance of Work by Third Parties</u></b>.    Whenever maintenance and repair work on
the Aircraft or Engines will be regularly performed by a Person other than LESSEE, such Person will
be an FAA-authorized repair station.

14.6            <b><u>Reimbursement Adjustment</u></b>.    By way of example, among the exclusions from
reimbursement are those items resulting from repairs covered by LESSEE's or a third party's
insurance (deductibles being for the account of LESSEE), or warranties or required as a result
of an Airworthiness Directive, manufacturer's service bulletin, faulty maintenance or installation,
improper operations, misuse, neglect, accident, incident, ingestion, or other accidental cause.
Reimbursement from the Reserves will not be available for the APU, quick engine change (QEC) Parts,
thrust reversers, or any of their associated components.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
if the Airframe, any Engine or any Landing Gear undergoes a repair or inspection that is otherwise
excluded from reimbursement pursuant to this Article 13.6, and if, in the course of such repair or
inspection, LESSEE performs additional work that (a) constitutes an Eligible Structural Check, an
Eligible Shop Visit, or an Overhaul of any Landing Gear or (b) results in an increase in the time
remaining until the next Eligible Structural Check, Eligible Shop Visit, or Overhaul of any Landing
Gear, then LESSEE shall be entitled to reimbursement for the cost of such additional work and the
same will not be excluded from reimbursement hereunder from the Airframe Reserves, Engine Performance
Restoration Reserves, Engine LLP Reserves or Landing Gear Reserves, as applicable.  All invoices
subject to reimbursement from LESSOR will be reduced (by adjustment between LESSEE and LESSOR
retroactively if necessary) by the actual amounts received by LESSEE on account of such work from
responsible third parties or other sources, such as insurance proceeds, manufacturer's warranties,
guarantees, concessions and credits actually received from such sources (including, with respect
to Engines, credits due to life remaining on any removed Engine Parts).

14.7            <b><u>Costs in Excess of Reserves</u></b>.    LESSEE will be responsible for payment of all
costs in excess of the amounts reimbursed hereunder.  If on any occasion the balance in the
Airframe Reserves, Engine Performance Restoration Reserves, Engine LLP Reserves or Landing Gear
Reserves for a particular Engine or Landing Gear (at the time of the structural check, in the
case of the Airframe, or at the time of removal, in the case of an Engine or the Landing Gear)
is insufficient to satisfy a claim for reimbursement in respect of the Airframe, such Engine
or the Landing Gear, as applicable, the shortfall may not be carried forward or made the
subject of any further claim for reimbursement.

14.8            Reimbursement after Termination Date.    LESSEE may not submit any invoice for
reimbursement from the Reserves after the Termination Date unless on or prior to such date LESSEE
has notified LESSOR in writing that such outstanding invoice will be submitted after the
Termination Date and the anticipated amount of such invoice.  So long as LESSEE has provided
such notice to LESSOR, LESSEE may then submit such outstanding invoice at any time within six
(6) months after the Termination Date.  In the event of the Total Loss of the Aircraft and
provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the unreimbursed Reserves
held by LESSOR will be paid to LESSEE.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 17</u></b>           <b><u>TAXES</u></b>


17.1            <b><u>General Obligation of LESSEE</u></b>.    Except as set forth in Article 16.2, LESSEE
agrees to pay promptly when due, and to indemnify and hold harmless LESSOR on a full indemnity
basis from, all license and registration fees and all taxes, fees, levies, imposts, duties,
charges, deductions or withholdings of any nature (including without limitation any value added,
franchise, transfer, sales, gross receipts, use, business, excise, turnover, personal property,
stamp or other tax) together with any assessments, penalties, fines, additions to tax or
interest thereon, however or wherever imposed (whether imposed upon LESSEE, LESSOR, on all or
part of the Aircraft, the Engines or otherwise), by any Government Entity or taxing authority
in the U.S. (including without limitation the City or County of Los Angeles), or any foreign
country or by any international taxing authority, upon or with respect to, based upon or
measured by any of the following (collectively, "<b><u>Taxes</u></b>"):

                (a)    the Aircraft, Engines or any Parts;

                (b)    the use, operation or maintenance of the Aircraft or carriage of
                       passengers or freight during the Lease Term;

                (c)    this Lease, the payments due hereunder and the terms and conditions
                       hereof; and

                (d)    the delivery under lease, import, export, or return of the Aircraft
                       or payment of Total Loss Proceeds.

17.2            Exceptions to Indemnity.    The indemnity provided for in Article 16.1 does
not extend to any of the following Taxes (hereinafter referred to as "<b><u>LESSOR's Taxes</u></b>"):

                (a)    Taxes imposed by the U.S. or by any Government Entity within the U.S.
                on the net income, profits or gains, accumulated or undistributed earnings or
                income, gross receipts, capital or net worth of LESSOR;

                (b)    Taxes attributable to the period, or an event occurring, prior to
                Delivery or after return of the Aircraft to LESSOR in accordance with this Lease;

                (c)    Taxes attributable to LESSOR's gross negligence, willful misconduct or
                breach of this Lease;

                (d)    Taxes which LESSEE is contesting in good faith in accordance with
                Article 16.5;

                (e)    Taxes imposed by any country other than the U.S. on the net income,
                gross receipts, capital or net worth of LESSOR but only to the extent that
               (i) such Taxes were not in any way connected with, due to or arising out of this
                Lease, LESSEE's business operations or office locations in any such country or
                LESSEE's use and operation of the Aircraft and (ii) such Taxes would be other-
                wise payable by LESSOR notwithstanding this Lease, LESSEE's business operations
                or office locations in any such country or LESSEE's use and operation of the
                Aircraft;

                (f)    Taxes imposed as a result of LESSOR's voluntary or involuntary transfer,
                pledge, assignment, financing, or other similar disposition of the Aircraft,
                Engines, any Parts, or this Lease or any interest in any of the foregoing
                (except a transfer or sale following LESSOR's exercise of any of its rights or
                remedies provided in Article 25.3) provided that LESSEE remains responsible for
                payment of any Taxes and the specific amount of such Taxes that it would have
                been required to indemnify for had such voluntary or involuntary transfer not
                occurred;

                (g)    Taxes consisting of any Taxes, interest, penalties or additions to Tax
                imposed on LESSOR as a result, in whole or in part, of a failure of LESSOR to
                file any Tax return or Tax-related registration properly and timely, unless such
                failure shall be caused by the failure of LESSEE to fulfill any obligations of
                LESSEE under Section 16.7 with respect to such Tax return; or

                (h)    Taxes resulting from, or that would not have been imposed but for, any
                LESSOR's Lien arising as a result of claims against, or acts or omissions of,
                or otherwise attributable to, LESSOR or any related party.

17.3            <b><u>After-Tax Basis</u></b>.    The amount which LESSEE is required to pay with respect to
any Taxes indemnified against under Article 16.1 is an amount sufficient to restore LESSOR on
an after-tax basis to the same position LESSOR would have been in had such Taxes not been
incurred.  If LESSOR determines in good faith that it has realized a Tax benefit (by way of
deduction, credit or otherwise) as a result of any payment for which LESSEE is liable under
Section 5.7 or 16.1 of this Lease, and such benefit was not previously taken into account in
calculating the amount of such payment on an after-tax basis in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence of this Article 16.3, LESSOR will pay to LESSEE an amount that is reasonably
sufficient to ensure that LESSOR is in no better an after-tax position than it would have been
in if the event giving rise to LESSEE's liability for payment had not occurred.

17.4            <b><u>Timing of Payment</u></b>.    Any amount payable to LESSOR pursuant to this Article 16
will be paid within ten (10) days after receipt of a written demand therefor from LESSOR
accompanied by a written statement describing in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity
and the computation of the amount so payable provided, however, that such amount need not be
paid by LESSEE prior to the earlier of (a) the date any Tax is payable to the appropriate
Government Entity or taxing authority or (b) in the case of amounts which are being contested
by LESSEE in good faith or by LESSOR pursuant to Article 16.5, the date such contest is finally
resolved.

17.5            <b><u>Contests</u></b>.    If claim is made against LESSOR for Taxes with respect to which
LESSEE is liable for a payment or indemnity under this Lease, LESSOR will promptly give LESSEE
notice in writing of such claim provided, however, that LESSOR's failure to give notice will
not relieve LESSEE of its obligations hereunder unless such failure materially impairs or
precludes LESSEE's ability to contest the claim.  So long as (a) a contest of such Taxes does
not involve any material risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft or any interest
therein, (b) if LESSOR so requests, LESSEE has provided LESSOR with an opinion of independent
tax counsel that a reasonable basis exists for contesting such claim and (c) adequate reserves
have been made for such Taxes or, if required, an adequate bond has been posted, then LESSOR
at LESSEE's written request will in good faith, with due diligence and at LESSEE's expense,
contest (or permit LESSEE to contest in the name of LESSEE or LESSOR) the validity,
applicability or amount of such Taxes.

17.6            <b><u>Refunds</u></b>.    Upon receipt by LESSOR of a refund of all or any part of any Taxes
(including any deductions or withholdings referred to in Article 5.8) which LESSEE has paid,
LESSOR will promptly pay to LESSEE the amount of such Taxes refunded, to the extent that the
underlying Tax liability has been extinguished.

17.7            <b><u>Cooperation in Filing Tax Returns</u></b>.    LESSEE and LESSOR will cooperate with
one another in providing information which may be reasonably required to fulfill each party's
tax filing requirements and any audit information request arising from such filing.

17.8            <b><u>Survival of Obligations</u></b>.    The indemnity obligations and other agreements of
LESSEE as set forth in this Article 16 will survive the Termination Date.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 30; page: 30" -->


         <b><u>ARTICLE 18</u></b>           <b><u>INDEMNITIES</u></b>


18.1            <b><u>General Indemnity</u></b>.    Except as set forth in Article 17.2 and Article 28.18,
LESSEE agrees to indemnify and hold harmless LESSOR and its officers, directors, employees,
agents and shareholders (individually an "<b><u>Indemnitee</u></b>" and collectively "<b><u>Indemnitees</u></b>") from
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits,
costs, disbursements and expenses (including legal fees, costs and related expenses) of every
kind and nature, whether or not any of the transactions contemplated by this Lease are
consummated (collectively "<b><u>Expenses</u></b>"), which are imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee and which are in any way relating to, based on or arising out of any of the following:

                (a)    this Lease or any transactions contemplated hereby;

                (b)    the operation, possession, use, non-use, control, leasing, subleasing,
                maintenance, storage, overhaul, testing, inspections or acceptance flights at
                return of the Aircraft, any Engine, or any Part during the Lease Term by LESSEE,
                any sublessee or any other Person, whether or not the same is in compliance with
                the terms of this Lease, including without limitation claims for death, personal
                injury, property damage, other loss or harm to any Person and claims relating
                to any Laws, including without limitation environmental control, noise and
                pollution laws, rules or regulations;

                (c)    the manufacture, design, acceptance, rejection, delivery, return, import,
                export, condition, repair, modification, servicing, rebuilding, enforcement of
                warranties whether in LESSOR's or LESSEE's name, any sale of the Aircraft in
                connection with the exercise of any of LESSOR's remedies provided in Article
                25.3, customer and product support provided by Manufacturer and other vendors,
                airworthiness, registration, reregistration, performance, sublease, merchantability,
                fitness for use, substitution or replacement of the Aircraft, Engine, or any Part
                under this Lease or other transfer of use or possession of the Aircraft, Engine,
                or any Part, including under a pooling or interchange arrangement, including
                without limitation latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable and
                patent, trademark or copyright infringement;

                (d)    any non-compliance by LESSEE with any term of this Lease or the falsity
                or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of LESSEE set forth herein;

                (e)    the prevention or attempt to prevent the lawful arrest, confiscation,
                seizure, taking in execution, impounding, forfeiture or detention of the Aircraft,
                or in securing the lawful release of the Aircraft; or

                (f)    as a consequence of any Default in payment by LESSEE of any sum to be
                paid by LESSEE when due under this Lease or any other Default by LESSEE in the
                due and punctual performance of its obligations under this Lease.

The foregoing indemnity by LESSEE is intended to include and cover any Expense to which an
Indemnitee may be subject (in contract, tort, strict liability or under any other theory)
regardless of the negligence, active or passive or any other type, of such Indemnitee, so
long as such Expense does not fall within any of the exceptions listed in Article 17.2.

18.2            <b><u>Exceptions to General Indemnities</u></b>.    The indemnity provided for in Article
17.1 will not extend to Expenses of any Indemnitee to the extent resulting from or arising out
of any of the following:

                (a)    Expenses which LESSEE and LESSOR mutually agree or, absent mutual agreement,
                are judicially determined to have resulted from the willful misconduct of such
                Indemnitee;

                (b)    Expenses which LESSEE and LESSOR mutually agree or, absent mutual agreement,
                are judicially determined to be attributable to incidents, accidents or occurrences
                prior to the Delivery Date, but only where both the act or omission which gave
                rise to the incident, accident or occurrence and the incident, accident or
                occurrence itself occurred prior to the Delivery Date;

                (c)    Expenses which LESSEE and LESSOR mutually agree or, absent mutual agreement,
                are judicially determined to be attributable to acts or events which occur after
                the Termination Date and return of the Aircraft to LESSOR in the condition required
                hereunder, but in any such case only to the extent not attributable to acts or
                omissions of LESSEE;

                (d)    Expenses representing Taxes, it being acknowledged that the terms of
                Article 16 apply exclusively to LESSEE's indemnity obligations with respect to
                Taxes;

                (e)    Expenses due to the breach by LESSOR of its covenant of quiet enjoyment
                pursuant to Article 21.2;

                (f)    Expenses arising directly from the willful misconduct of an Indemnitee;

                (g)    Expenses related to LESSOR Taxes or a LESSOR's Lien;

                (h)    Expenses that LESSOR has expressly agreed to pay under this Lease;

                (i)    Expenses which are attributable to the assignment, pledge, financing
                or other related activity of LESSOR or any Indemnitee with respect to the Aircraft
                or this Lease;

                (j)    Expenses of any Indemnitee which are ordinary and customary operating,
                overhead or administrative expenses;

                (k)    Expenses which are attributable to LESSOR'S failure to maintain U.S.
                citizenship as required by Article 21.3; and

                (l)    Expenses which are attributable to any Indemnitee's default or failure
                to perform under any financing or related agreement with respect to the Aircraft.

18.3            <b><u>After-Tax Basis</u></b>.    The amount which LESSEE will be required to pay with respect
to any Expense indemnified against under Article 17.1 will be an amount sufficient to restore
the Indemnitee, on an after-tax basis, to the same position such Indemnitee would have been in
had such Expense not been incurred.

18.4            <b><u>Timing of Payment</u></b>.    Subject to Article 17.8 and LESSEE's right to defend any
claims that are subject to this ARTICLE 17, it is the intent of the parties that each Indemnitee
will have the right to indemnification for Expenses hereunder as soon as a claim is made and
as soon as an Expense is incurred.  LESSEE will pay an Indemnitee for Expenses pursuant to this
Article 17 within ten (10) days after receipt of a written demand therefor from such Indemnitee
accompanied by a written statement describing in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity,
the actual Expense which is claimed, and the computation of the amount payable.

18.5            <b><u>Subrogation</u></b>.    Upon the payment in full of any indemnity pursuant to this
Article 17 by LESSEE, LESSEE will be subrogated to any right of the Indemnitee in respect of
the matter against which such indemnity has been made.

18.6            <b><u>Notice</u></b>.    Each Indemnitee and LESSEE will give prompt written notice one to
the other of any liability of which such party has knowledge for which LESSEE is, or may be,
liable under Article 17.1 provided, however, that failure to give such notice will not terminate
any of the rights of Indemnitees under this Article 17 except to the extent that LESSEE has
been materially prejudiced by the failure to provide such notice.

18.7            <b><u>Refunds</u></b>.    If any Indemnitee obtains a recovery of all or any part of any
amount which LESSEE has paid to such indemnitee, such Indemnitee will promptly pay to LESSEE the
net amount recovered by such Indemnitee.

18.8            <b><u>Defense of Claims</u></b>.    Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
LESSEE and its insurers will have the right (in each such case at LESSEE's sole expense) to
investigate or defend or compromise any claim covered by insurance for which indemnification is
sought pursuant to Article 17.1, provided that if LESSEE or its insurers have reserved the right
to dispute liability with respect to any insurance policies pursuant to which coverage is sought,
then LESSEE shall be obliged to ensure that its indemnity obligations are adequately secured to
the reasonable satisfaction of LESSOR.   Each Indemnitee will cooperate with LESSEE or its
insurers with respect to any such defense of claims.  If LESSEE or its insurers are retaining
attorneys to handle any such claim, such counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitees.  If not, the Indemnitees will have the right to retain counsel of their choice at
LESSEE's expense.

18.9            <b><u>Survival of Obligation</u></b>.    Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the
contrary, the provisions of this Article 17 will survive the Termination Date and continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding any breach by LESSOR or LESSEE of the terms of this Lease,
the termination of the lease of the Aircraft to LESSEE under this Lease or the repudiation by
LESSOR or LESSEE of this Lease.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 31; page: 31" -->


         <b><u>ARTICLE 19</u></b>           <b><u>INSURANCE</u></b>


19.1            <b><u>Categories of Insurance</u></b>.    Throughout the Lease Term and until the Termination
Date, LESSEE will, at its own expense, effect and maintain in full force and effect the types
of insurance and amounts of insurance (including deductibles) described in Exhibit E through
brokers and insurers of recognized standing in the London or New York insurance markets or, in
the event of a sublease to a Permitted Sublessee, with such brokers and with such insurers in
the London or New York markets as may be approved by LESSOR, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld.

19.2            <b><u>Third Party War Liability Insurance</u></b>.    LESSEE will provide evidence to LESSOR
that the U.S. government indemnity for third party (non-passenger) war liability covers LESSEE
and its operation of the Aircraft, up to the limits of coverage specified in Exhibit E for
Aircraft Third Party, Passenger, Baggage, Cargo and Mail Liability and Airline General Third
Party Liability.  For so long as such U.S. government indemnity is in effect and LESSEE is
covered thereby with respect to the Aircraft, LESSOR agrees that LESSEE may substitute such
indemnity for Extended Coverage Endorsement AVN 52D and the excess coverage required by Exhibit
E.  In the event that LESSEE is no longer covered by such U.S. government indemnity, LESSEE
will carry Extended Coverage Endorsement AVN 52D and excess third party war liability insurance
coverage in the amount required by Exhibit E.

19.3            <b><u>Installation of Third Party Engine</u></b>.    If LESSEE installs an engine not owned
by LESSOR on the Aircraft, either (a) LESSEE's hull insurance on the Aircraft will automatically
increase to such higher amount as is necessary in order to satisfy both LESSOR's requirement to
receive the Agreed Value in the event of a Total Loss and the amount required by the third party
engine owner or (b) separate additional insurance on such engine will attach in order to satisfy
separately the requirements of the LESSEE to such third party engine owner.

19.4            <b><u>Insurance for Indemnities</u></b>.    The insurance referred to in Article 18.1 will
in each case include and insure (to the extent of the risks covered by the policies) the
indemnity provisions of Article 17 and LESSEE will maintain such insurance of the indemnities
for a minimum of two (2) years following the Termination Date.

19.5            <b><u>Renewal</u></b>.    Not less than five (5) Business Days before the expiration or
termination date of any insurance required hereunder, LESSEE will provide LESSOR with fax
confirmation from LESSEE's insurance brokers that renewed certificates of insurance evidencing
the renewal or replacement of such insurance and complying with Exhibit E will be issued on
the termination date of the prior certificate.  Prior to such termination date, LESSEE's
insurance brokers will provide LESSOR with fax confirmation that such renewed certificates
have been issued.  Within seven (7) days after such renewal, LESSEE will furnish its brokers'
certificates of insurance to LESSOR.

19.6            <b><u>Assignment of Rights by LESSOR</u></b>.    If LESSOR assigns all or any of its rights
under this Lease as permitted by this Lease or otherwise disposes of any interest in the Aircraft
to any other Person, LESSEE will, upon request, procure that such Person hereunder be added as
loss payee and/or additional assured in the policies effected hereunder and enjoy the same
rights and insurance enjoyed by LESSOR under such policies.  LESSOR will nevertheless continue
to be covered by such policies.

19.7            <b><u>Deductibles</u></b>.    If there has been a Payment Default and there is a material
adverse change in the financial condition of LESSEE which LESSOR reasonably believes will cause
LESSEE to be unable to pay the deductible upon the occurrence of a partial loss of the Aircraft
or an Engine, then LESSOR may require LESSEE at LESSEE's expense to lower its deductibles on
the insurance maintained hereunder to a level which is available on commercially reasonable
terms in the insurance market.

19.8            <b><u>Insurance for Wet Lease Operations</u></b>.    In the event LESSEE is performing wet
lease operations with the Aircraft pursuant to Article 11.5 and the wet lessee is carrying
the primary passenger, baggage and cargo liability insurance with respect to the flights, then
such insurance must meet the requirements of Exhibit E, including with respect to the amounts
of coverage, naming of LESSOR as an additional insured and inclusion of the other endorsements
set forth in Exhibit E.  Moreover, LESSEE will at all times carry contingent passenger, baggage
and cargo liability insurances for such flights.  Prior to commencement of wet lease operations
for a particular wet lessee, LESSOR will receive certificates of insurance from the insurance
brokers for LESSEE and, if applicable, the wet lessee evidencing such coverages.

19.9            <b><u>Other Insurance</u></b>.    LESSOR may from time to time by notice to LESSEE require
LESSEE at LESSEE's expense to effect such other insurance or such variations to the terms of
the existing insurance as may then be customary in the airline industry for aircraft of the
same type as the Aircraft and at the time commonly available in the insurance market.

19.10           <b><u>Information</u></b>.    LESSEE will provide LESSOR with any information reasonably
requested by LESSOR from time to time concerning the insurance maintained with respect to the
Aircraft or in connection with any claim being made or proposed to be made thereunder.

19.11           <b><u>Currency</u></b>.    All proceeds of insurance pursuant to this Lease will be payable
in Dollars except as may be otherwise agreed by LESSOR.

19.12           <b><u>Grounding of Aircraft</u></b>.    If at any time any of the insurance required pursuant
to this Lease will cease to be in full force and effect, LESSEE will forthwith ground the
Aircraft and keep the Aircraft grounded until such time as such insurance is in full force
and effect again.

19.13           <b><u>Failure to Insure</u></b>.    If at any time LESSEE fails to maintain insurance in
compliance with this Article 18, LESSOR will be entitled but not bound to do any of the following
(without prejudice to any other rights which it may have under this Lease by reason of such
failure):

                (a)    to pay any premiums due or to effect or maintain insurance reasonably
                satisfactory to LESSOR or otherwise remedy such failure in such manner as
                LESSOR considers appropriate (and LESSEE will upon demand reimburse LESSOR in
                full for any amount so expended in that connection); or

                (b)    at any time while such failure is continuing, to require the Aircraft
                to remain at any airport or (as the case may be), proceed to and remain at any
                airport designated by LESSOR, until such failure is remedied to LESSOR's
                satisfaction.

19.14           <b><u>Reinsurance</u></b>.    In the event that the Aircraft is subleased to a Permitted
Sublessee located outside of the U.S., any reinsurance will be maintained with reinsurers and
brokers approved by LESSOR.  Such reinsurance will contain each of the following terms and
will in all other respects (including amount) be satisfactory to LESSOR:

                (a)    the same terms as the original insurance;

                (b)    a cut-through and assignment clause satisfactory to LESSOR; and

                (c)    payment will be made notwithstanding (i) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
                liquidation or dissolution of any of the original insurers and/or (ii) that
                the original insurers have made no payment under the original insurance policies.

                In the event that LESSEE and other, similarly situated commercial air carriers
in the U.S. change the structure of their insurance coverage with respect to reinsurance,
LESSEE and LESSOR will discuss in good faith whether the foregoing provisions relating to
reinsurance should apply to this Lease.

19.15           <b><u>Limit on Hull in Favor of LESSEE</u></b>.    LESSEE may carry hull all risks or hull
war and allied perils on the Aircraft in excess of the Agreed Value (which is payable to LESSOR)
only to the extent such excess insurance which would be payable to LESSEE in the event of a
Total Loss does not exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Agreed Value and only to the
extent that such additional insurance will not prejudice the insurances required herein or the
recovery by LESSOR thereunder.  LESSEE agrees that it will not create or permit to exist any
liens or encumbrances over the insurances, or its interest therein, except as constituted by
this Lease.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 20</u></b>           <b><u>LOSS, DAMAGE AND REQUISITION</u></b>


                Throughout the Lease Term and until the Termination Date, LESSEE will bear all
risk of loss, theft, damage and destruction to the Aircraft.

20.1            <b><u>Definitions</u></b>.    In this Article 19 and throughout this Lease:

                "<b><u>Agreed Value</u></b>" has the meaning set forth in Paragraph 14 of Exhibit C.

                "<b><u>Net Total Loss Proceeds</u></b>" means the Total Loss Proceeds actually received by
LESSOR following a Total Loss, less any legal and other out-of-pocket expenses, taxes or duties
incurred by LESSOR in connection with the collection of such proceeds.

                "<b><u>Total Loss</u></b>" means any of the following in relation to the Aircraft, Airframe
or any Engine, and "<b><u>Total Loss Date</u></b>" means the date set forth in parenthesis after each Total Loss:

                (a)    destruction, damage beyond repair or being rendered permanently unfit for
                normal use for any reason (the date such event occurs or, if not known, the date
                on which the Aircraft, Airframe or Engine was last heard of);

                (b)    actual or constructive total loss (including any damage to the Aircraft
                which results in an insurance settlement on the basis of a total loss) (the
                earlier of the date on which the loss occurs or thirty (30) days after the
                date of notice to LESSEE's brokers or insurers claiming such total loss);

                (c)    requisition of title, confiscation, forfeiture or any compulsory
                acquisition or other similar event (the date on which the same takes effect);

                (d)    sequestration, detention, seizure or any similar event for more than
                sixty (60) consecutive days or one-hundred eighty (180) consecutive days if
                the Aircraft is located in the U.S. for such entire period (the earlier of the
                date on which insurers make payment on the basis of a total loss or the date
                of expiration of such period);

                (e)    requisition for use for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
                days, except as set forth in ARTICLE 19.8 (the earlier of the date on which
                the insurers make payment on the basis of a total loss or the date of expiration
                of such period); or

                (f)    in the case of an Engine, the event described in Article 12.6.3 (the
                date on which the same takes effect).

                "<b><u>Total Loss Proceeds</u></b>" means the proceeds of any insurance or any compensation
or similar payment arising in respect of a Total Loss.

20.2            <b><u>Notice of Total Loss</u></b>.    LESSEE will notify LESSOR in writing within two (2)
Business Days after a Total Loss Date of the Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine.

20.3            <b><u>Total Loss of Aircraft or Airframe</u></b>.    If the Total Loss of the Aircraft or
Airframe occurs during the Lease Term, the following will occur:

20.3.1          After the Total Loss Date and until receipt by LESSOR of the Agreed Value and
                all other amounts then due under this Lease, LESSEE will continue to pay Rent
                and the parties will perform, to the extent possible, all of their other
                obligations under this Lease.

20.3.2          On the date which is the earlier of the following dates:

                       (a)    the date on which the Total Loss Proceeds of the Aircraft or the
                       Airframe are paid by LESSEE's insurance underwriters or brokers and

                       (b)    the date which falls sixty (60) days after the Total Loss Date,

                LESSEE will pay to LESSOR an amount equal to the sum of:

                       (a)    the Agreed Value and

                       (b)    all other amounts then due under this Lease,

                less an amount equal to the Net Total Loss Proceeds received by LESSOR by such date.

20.3.3          LESSOR will apply the Net Total Loss Proceeds and any amounts received from
                LESSEE pursuant to Article 19.3.2 as follows:

                       (a)    first, in discharge of any unpaid Rent and any other amounts accrued
                       and unpaid up to the date of LESSOR's receipt of the Agreed Value;

                       (b)    second, in discharge of the Agreed Value; and

                       (c)    third, payment of the balance, if any, to LESSEE.

20.3.4          Upon receipt by LESSOR of all monies payable by LESSEE in Article 19.3, this
                Lease will terminate except for LESSEE's obligations under Articles 10.5, 16
                and 17 which survive the Termination Date, and LESSOR will relinquish title to
                the Aircraft to the insurance underwriters or LESSEE, as appropriate.

FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE AGREED VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT WILL BE PAYABLE TO LESSOR PURSUANT TO
THIS ARTICLE 19.3 WHEN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE AIRFRAME OCCURS EVEN IF THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOTAL
LOSS OF AN ENGINE OR ENGINES.

20.4            <b><u>Surviving Engine(s)</u></b>.    If a Total Loss of the Airframe occurs and there has
not been a Total Loss of an Engine or Engines, then, provided no Default has occurred and is
continuing, at the request of LESSEE (subject to agreement of relevant insurers) and on receipt
of all monies due under Article 19.3 and payment by LESSEE of all airport, navigation and other
charges on the Aircraft, LESSOR will transfer all its right, title and interest in the surviving
Engine(s) to LESSEE, but without any responsibility, condition or warranty on the part of LESSOR
other than as to freedom from any LESSOR's Lien.

20.5            <b><u>Total Loss of Engine and Not Airframe</u></b>.

20.5.1          Upon a Total Loss of any Engine not installed on the Airframe or a Total Loss
                of an Engine installed on the Airframe not involving a Total Loss of the Airframe,
                LESSEE will replace such Engine as soon as reasonably possible by duly conveying
                to LESSOR title to another engine (a) free and clear of all Security Interests
                (except Permitted Liens) of any kind or description, (b) in airworthy condition
                and of the same or improved model, service bulletin and modification status and
                having a value and utility at least equal to the Engine which sustained the Total
                Loss, (c) in the same or better operating condition as the Engine which sustained
                a Total Loss, including time in service, hours and cycles since new and hours and
                cycles available to the next inspection, Overhaul or scheduled or anticipated
                removal.  In all circumstances, with respect to life limited Parts in any
                replacement engine, (x) the life limited Part that is due to be removed earliest
                in such replacement engine will have no less life remaining than the life limited
                Part that was due to be removed earliest in the Engine which sustained the Total
                Loss and (y) the average life remaining for all life limited Parts in the
                replacement engine will be no less than the average life remaining for the life
                limited Parts in the Engine which sustained the Total Loss.  Such replacement
                engine will be an Engine as defined herein and the Engine which sustained such
                Total Loss will cease to be an Engine; whereupon, subject to agreement of relevant
                insurers, LESSOR will transfer all of its right, title and interest in and to
                the Engine which sustained the Total Loss to LESSEE, but without any responsibility,
                condition or warranty on the part of LESSOR other than as to title and freedom
                from any LESSOR's Lien.

20.5.2          LESSEE agrees at its own expense to take such action as LESSOR may reasonably
                request in order that any such replacement Engine becomes the property of LESSOR
                and is leased hereunder on the same terms as the destroyed Engine. LESSEE's
                obligation to pay Rent will continue in full force and effect, but an amount
                equal to the Net Total Loss Proceeds received by LESSOR with respect to such
                destroyed Engine will, subject to LESSOR's right to deduct therefrom any amounts
                then due and payable by LESSEE under this Lease, be paid to LESSEE.

20.6            <b><u>Other Loss or Damage</u></b>.

20.6.1          If the Aircraft or any Part thereof suffers loss or damage not constituting a
                Total Loss of the Aircraft or the Airframe or any Engine, all the obligations
                of LESSEE under this Lease (including payment of Rent) will continue in full
                force.

20.6.2          In the event of any loss or damage to the Aircraft or Airframe which does not
                constitute a Total Loss of the Aircraft or the Airframe, or any loss or damage
                to an Engine which does not constitute a Total Loss of such Engine, LESSEE will
                at its sole cost and expense fully repair the Aircraft, Engine or APU in order
                that the Aircraft or Engine is placed in an airworthy condition and substantially
                the same condition as it was prior to such loss or damage.  All repairs will be
                performed in a manner which preserves and maintains, to the extent possible, all
                warranties and service life policies to the same extent as they existed prior
                to such loss or damage.  LESSEE will notify LESSOR forthwith of any loss, theft
                or damage to the Aircraft for which the cost of repairs is estimated to exceed
                [SEE PARAGRAPH 15 OF EXHIBIT C.], together with LESSEE's proposal for carrying
                out the repair.  In the event that LESSOR does not agree with LESSEE's proposals
                for repair, LESSOR will so notify LESSEE within two (2) Business Days after its
                receipt of such proposal.  Upon receipt of such notice from LESSOR, LESSEE and
                LESSOR will then consult with Manufacturer and LESSEE and LESSOR agree to accept
                as conclusive, and be bound by, Manufacturer's directions or recommendations as to
                the manner in which to carry out such repairs.  If Manufacturer declines to give
                directions or recommendations, LESSEE will carry out the repairs in accordance
                with the directions of LESSOR.

20.6.3          To the extent insurance proceeds received by LESSEE directly from its insurers
                do not cover the cost of such repair work on the Aircraft or Engine and LESSOR
                has received additional insurance proceeds from LESSEE's insurers with respect
                to such repair work, LESSOR will (subject to LESSOR's right to deduct therefrom
                any amounts then due and payable by LESSEE under this Lease and submission by
                LESSEE of reasonable documentation in support of such excess repair costs) pay
                to LESSEE insurance proceeds received by LESSOR as and when such repair work is
                performed on the Aircraft.

20.7            <b><u>Copy of Insurance Policy</u></b>.    Promptly after the occurrence of a partial loss or
Total Loss of the Aircraft or an Engine, at the request of LESSOR (and then only in the event
reasonably required by LESSOR in connection with insurance policies pursuant to which coverage
is sought) LESSEE will provide LESSOR with a copy of the relevant portions of LESSEE's insurance
policy. LESSEE's insurance policy will be confidential between LESSOR and LESSEE and will not
be disclosed by LESSOR to third parties other than LESSOR's professional advisors and except as
necessary in respect of proceedings relating to such insurance claim.

20.8            <b><u>Government Requisition</u></b>.    If the Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine is
requisitioned for use by any Government Entity, LESSEE will promptly notify LESSOR of such
requisition.  All of LESSEE's obligations hereunder will continue as if such requisition had
not occurred.  So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all payments
received by LESSOR or LESSEE from such Government Entity will be paid over to or retained by
LESSEE.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all payments received by LESSEE
or LESSOR from such Government Entity may be used by LESSOR to satisfy any obligations owing by
LESSEE.

20.9            <b><u>Return of Security Deposit and other Amounts</u></b>.    For avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that in the event of the Total Loss of the Airframe, upon receipt by LESSOR of
all monies payable by LESSEE in accordance with Article 19.3, and subject always to the terms
of Articles 5.1.3 and 13.8, LESSOR will (a) return to LESSEE the amount of the Security Deposit
then held by LESSOR and any prepaid Rent and (b) pay to LESSEE an amount equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the Reserves then held by LESSOR and which are not subject to a claim for
reimbursement pursuant to Article 13.5.

documents described in Exhibit M in one central room at the Aircraft return location.

24.5            <b><u>Aircraft Inspection</u></b>.

24.5.1          During the maintenance checks performed immediately prior to the proposed
                redelivery ("<b><u>Final Check</u></b>") and at the actual return of the Aircraft, LESSOR
                and/or its representatives will have an opportunity to conduct a full systems
                functional and operational inspection of the Aircraft (and other types of
                reasonable inspections based upon the Aircraft type, age, use and other known
                factors with respect to the Aircraft; provided that LESSOR's access for
                inspection shall be limited to those areas of the Aircraft that are exposed on
                the Aircraft during the course of performance of the Final Check and without
                opening or removing panels, compartments or bays unless (a) such opening or
                removal is specified as part of the Final Check or (b) LESSOR has reasonable
                visual grounds to suspect corrosion and a full inspection of the Aircraft
                Documentation (including records and manuals), all to LESSOR's reasonable
                satisfaction.  Any deficiencies from the Aircraft return condition requirements
                set forth in this Article 23 will be corrected by LESSEE at its cost prior to
                the acceptance flight described in Article 23.5.2.

24.5.2          Immediately prior to the proposed redelivery of the Aircraft, LESSEE will carry

                of LESSEE.  Any deficiencies from the Aircraft return condition requirements
                set forth in this Article 23 will be corrected by LESSEE at its cost prior to
                return of the Aircraft.

24.5.3          To the extent that the ground inspection and acceptance flight extend beyond
                the Expiration Date, the Lease Term will be deemed to have been automatically
                extended and the obligations of LESSEE hereunder (including Article 23.11.3)
                will continue on a day-to-day basis until the Aircraft is accepted by LESSOR
                as being in the condition required hereunder, which acceptance shall be
                evidenced by LESSOR executing and delivering to LESSEE the Return Acceptance
                Receipt in the form of Exhibit K.


24.6            <b><u>Certificate of Airworthiness Matters</u></b>.

24.6.1          The Aircraft will possess a current Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the
                Aviation Authority (although this Certificate of Airworthiness may be
                substituted by an Export Certificate of Airworthiness or equivalent if requested
                by LESSOR pursuant to Article 23.6.3).  In addition, even if LESSEE must perform
                engineering, maintenance and repair work on the Aircraft beyond the requirements
                of Article 12, the Aircraft at return must be in the condition required in order
                to meet the requirements for issuance of a U.S. Standard Certificate of
                Airworthiness for transport category aircraft issued by the FAA in accordance
                with FAR Part 21 and, in addition, to meet the operating requirements of FAR
                Part 121.

24.6.2          If the Aircraft is registered in a country other than the U.S. at time of return,
                LESSEE at its cost will demonstrate that the Aircraft meets the requirements
                for issuance of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Airworthiness for transport
                category aircraft specified in Article 23.6.1 by delivering to LESSOR at its
                option either an actual U.S. Standard Certificate of Airworthiness (if the
                Aircraft is to be registered in the U.S.) or a letter reasonably acceptable to
                LESSOR signed by an FAA Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR) or another
                Person reasonably acceptable to LESSOR stating that the DAR or such Person has
                inspected the Aircraft and Aircraft Documentation (including records and manuals)
                and has found that the Aircraft meets the requirements for issuance of a U.S.
                Standard Certificate of Airworthiness for transport category aircraft in
                accordance with FAR Part 21 and, in addition, meets the operating requirements
                of FAR Part 121.

24.6.3          If the Aircraft is to be registered in a country other than in the U.S. after
                return from LESSEE, LESSOR may in its sole discretion waive the requirements
                of Article 23.6.1 and instead require that LESSEE at its expense (to the extent
                such expense is no greater than that which LESSEE would have incurred pursuant
                to Article 23.6.1, with any additional expenses being for LESSOR's account):

                (a)    obtain an Export Certificate of Airworthiness from the State of
                Registration, and

                (b)    subject to LESSEE's capacity, resources, and technical capability, put
                the Aircraft in a condition to meet the requirements for issuance of a
                Certificate of Airworthiness of the Aviation Authority of the next country of
                register, provided that if solely as a result of such work the Aircraft is
                returned after the scheduled redelivery date, LESSEE will not be liable for
                payment of Rent in respect of the period following the date the Aircraft would
                have been returned following completion of the requirements of this Article 23,
                but for the provisions of this Article 23.6.3.

24.7.15         If any waivers, deviations, dispensations, alternate means of compliance,
                extensions or carry-overs with respect to maintenance or operating requirements,
                repairs or Airworthiness Directives are granted by the Aviation Authority or
                permitted by the Maintenance Program, LESSEE at its sole cost and expense will
                nonetheless perform such maintenance or operating requirements, repairs or
                Airworthiness Directives as if such waivers, deviations, dispensations, alternate
                means of compliance, or extensions or carry-overs did not exist, unless such
                waivers, deviations, dispensations, alternate means of compliance, extensions
                or carry-overs are applicable to all A319 aircraft and operators of such
                aircraft worldwide.

24.7.16         The Aircraft will be free from any Security Interest except LESSOR's Liens
                and no circumstance will have so arisen whereby the Aircraft is or could become
                subject to any Security Interest or right of detention or sale in favor of the
                Aviation Authority, any airport authority, or any other authority.

24.7.17         All no-charge vendor and Manufacturer's service bulletin kits received by
                LESSEE for the Aircraft but not installed thereon will be on board the Aircraft
                as cargo.  At LESSOR's request, any other service bulletin kit which LESSEE paid
                for will also be delivered to LESSOR on board the Aircraft, but LESSOR will
                reimburse LESSEE for its actual out-of-pocket costs for such kit, unless LESSEE
                purchased such kit as part of its implementation of a service bulletin on its
                fleet of aircraft of the same type as the Aircraft but had not yet installed
                such kit on the Aircraft, in which case such kit will be furnished free of
                charge to LESSOR.

24.7.18         The Aircraft will be free of any leaks and any damage resulting therefrom.  All
                repairs will have been performed on a permanent basis in accordance with the
                applicable manufacturer's instructions.

24.7.19         The Aircraft fluid reservoirs (including oil, oxygen, hydraulic and water) will
                be serviced to full and the waste tank serviced in accordance with Manufacturer's
                instructions.  Fuel tanks will be at least as full as at Delivery.

24.8            <b><u>Checks Prior to Return</u></b>.    Immediately prior to return of the Aircraft to LESSOR,
                LESSEE at its expense will do each of the following:

24.8.1          Have performed, by LESSEE or any other FAA-approved repair station, the next
                due full and complete zonal, systems and structural check ("C" or its equivalent),
                the corresponding lower checks ("A" and "B" or equivalent) and any other
                maintenance and inspections tasks, all in accordance with the then-current MPD
                (save only for those MPD tasks which are (a) non-MRB tasks (as defined in the MPD)
                and (b) which arise from information service bulletins and/or service information
                letters that relate to service bulletins and/or modifications that have not been
                incorporated in the Aircraft), sufficient to clear the Aircraft for operation
                until the next-scheduled full and complete zonal, systems and structural check
                under the then-current MPD (which in any event will not be less than fifteen (15)
                months). LESSEE will also weigh the Aircraft.  Any discrepancies revealed during
                such inspection will be corrected in accordance with Manufacturer's maintenance
                and repair manuals or FAA-approved data.  Subject to LESSEE's capacity, resources,
                and technical capability, LESSEE agrees to perform during such check any other
                work reasonably required by LESSOR (and not otherwise required under this Lease)
                and LESSOR will reimburse LESSEE for such work at LESSEE's preferred customer rates.

24.8.2          Remove LESSEE's exterior markings, including all exterior paint, by stripping (or,
                at LESSOR's option, pneumatically scuff/sanding) the paint from the fuselage,
                empennage, wings and Engine cowlings, and clean, reseal, refinish, prepare
                (including application of alodine or another corrosion inhibitor) and prime the
                surfaces to be painted, all in accordance with Manufacturer's and paint
                manufacturer's recommendations.  LESSEE will then repaint the fuselage, empennage,
                wings and Engine cowlings in the colors and logo specified by LESSOR provided,
                however, that if such colors and logo are substantially more complex than those
                of LESSEE, at LESSOR's discretion, LESSOR will either (i) pay to LESSEE an amount
                equal to the incremental cost of repainting the Aircraft in such complex colors
                and logo over and above the cost of repainting the Aircraft in LESSEE's colors
                and logo at such time or (ii) permit LESSEE to return the Aircraft repainted
                white and to pay LESSOR an amount equal to the incremental cost of painting the
                colors and logo required by LESSOR's next operator, up to an amount equal to
                the amount that would have been required to paint the Aircraft in LESSEE's livery.
                Such painting will be accomplished in such a manner as to result in a uniformly
                smooth and cosmetically acceptable aerodynamic surface.  All external placards,
                signs and markings will be properly attached, free from damage, clean and legible.

24.8.3          Clean the exterior and interior of the Aircraft.

24.8.4          If reasonably requested by LESSOR, repaint the flight deck and replace placards
                of the Aircraft.

24.8.5          In accordance with Article 23.7.7, permanently repair damage to the Aircraft
                that exceeds Manufacturer's limits and replace any non-flush structural patch
                repairs installed on the Aircraft with flush-type repairs unless Manufacturer
                does not recommend a flush-type repair.

24.8.6          With LESSOR or its representatives present, perform a full and complete hot
                and cold section videotape borescope on each Engine and its modules in accordance
                with the Engine manufacturer's maintenance manual.

24.8.7          If the Engine historical and technical records and/or condition trend monitoring
                data of any Engine (including the APU, if such data are available) indicate an
                acceleration in the rate of deterioration in performance, such that the Engine
                will not meet the requirements of Article 23.9.2 in light of the Engine
                manufacturer's data, LESSEE will correct, to LESSOR's reasonable satisfaction,
                such conditions which are determined to be causing such accelerated rate
                of deterioration.

24.8.8          With LESSOR or its representatives present, accomplish a power assurance run
                (if reasonably requested by LESSOR), acceleration and bleed valve scheduling
                checks on the Engines.  LESSEE will evaluate the Engine performance and record
                the Engine power assurance test conditions and results on the Return Acceptance
                Receipt.

24.8.9          If the Engine historical and technical records, borescope inspection, trend
                monitoring and other checks specified in Article 23.8.8 reveal any condition
                which would cause the Engines or any module to be unserviceable, beyond
                serviceable limits or serviceable with an increased frequency of inspection or
                with calendar time, flight hour or flight cycle restrictions under the Engine
                manufacturer's maintenance manual LESSEE will correct such discrepancies in
                accordance with the guidelines set out by the Engine manufacturer which may be
                discovered during such inspections.

24.8.10         In the event the Engine historical and technical records, borescope inspection,
                trend monitoring and other checks specified in Article 23.8.8 result in a dispute
                regarding the conformity of an Engine with the requirements of this Article 23,
                LESSEE and LESSOR will consult with Engine manufacturer and follow Engine
                manufacturer's recommendations (including the accomplishment of an Engine test
                cell operational check) with regard to determining if such Engine complies with
                the requirements of this Article 23 and the manner in which any discrepancies
                from the requirements of this Article 23 will be rectified.

24.10           <b><u>Export and Deregistration of Aircraft</u></b>.    At LESSOR's request by notice at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the Expiration Date, LESSEE will (a) pursuant to the terms of
Article 23.6.3, provide an Export Certificate of Airworthiness or its equivalent from the State
of Registration for the country designated by LESSOR, (b) assist with deregistration of the
Aircraft from the register of aircraft in the State of Registration, and (c) perform any other
acts reasonably required by LESSOR in connection with such deregistration.

24.11           <b><u>LESSEE's Continuing Obligations</u></b>.    In the event that LESSEE does not return
the Aircraft to LESSOR on the Expiration Date and in the condition required by this Article 23
for any reason (whether or not the reason is within LESSEE's control):

24.11.1         the obligations of LESSEE under this Lease will continue in full force and effect
                on a day-to-day basis until such return.  This will not be considered a waiver of
                LESSEE's Event of Default or any right of LESSOR hereunder.

24.11.2         Until such return, the Agreed Value will be an amount equal to the Agreed Value
                on the day the Aircraft should have been returned to LESSOR pursuant to this Lease.

24.11.3         SEE PARAGRAPH 18 OF EXHIBIT C.

24.11.4         LESSOR may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to accept the return of
                the Aircraft prior to the Aircraft being put in the condition required by this
                Article 23 and thereafter have any such non-conformance corrected at such time
                as LESSOR may deem appropriate (but within ninety (90) days following the return
                of the Aircraft) and at commercial rates then-charged by the Person selected by
                LESSOR to perform such correction.  Any direct and reasonable expenses incurred
                by LESSOR for such correction will become additional Rent payable by LESSEE
                within fifteen (15) days following the submission of a written statement by
                LESSOR to LESSEE, identifying the items corrected and setting forth the expense
                of such corrections in reasonable detail.  LESSEE's obligation to pay such
                supplemental Rent will survive the Termination Date.

24.12           <b><u>Airport and Navigation Charges</u></b>.    LESSEE will ensure that at return of the
Aircraft any and all airport, navigation and other charges which give rise or would if unpaid
give rise to any lien, right of detention, right of sale or other Security Interest in relation
to the Aircraft, Engine or any Part have been paid and discharged in full and will at LESSOR's
request produce evidence thereof reasonably satisfactory to LESSOR.

24.13           <b><u>Return Acceptance Certificate</u></b>.    Upon return of the Aircraft in accordance
with the terms of this Lease, LESSEE will promptly prepare and execute two (2) Return Acceptance
Certificates in the form and substance of Exhibit K and LESSOR will countersign and return one
such Return Acceptance Certificate to LESSEE.  In addition, LESSEE and LESSOR will execute a
Lease Termination for filing with the FAA evidencing termination of this Lease.

24.14           <b><u>Indemnities and Insurance</u></b>.    The indemnities and insurance requirements set
forth in Articles 17 and 18, respectively, will apply to Indemnitees and LESSOR's representatives
during return of the Aircraft, including the ground inspection and acceptance flight.  With
respect to the acceptance flight, LESSOR's representatives will receive the same protections as
LESSOR on LESSEE's Aviation and Airline General Third Party Liability Insurance.

24.15           <b><u>Civil Reserve Air Fleet</u></b>.

24.15.1         LESSEE may transfer possession of the Aircraft to the United States of America
                or any instrumentality or agency thereof as part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
                Program authorized under 10 U.S.C.ss.9511 et seq. (or any substantially similar
                program) ("<b><u>CRAF Program</u></b>") for a period which includes (collectively, the "<b><u>CRAF</u></b>
                <b><u>Program Requisition Period</u></b>")

                (a) the entire period of requisition under the CRAF Program and (b) an additional
                six (6) months after the expiration of the requisition under the CRAF Program.
                If the CRAF Program Requisition Period extends beyond the Expiration Date provided
                by this Lease, then the Lease will be deemed to continue until the end of the CRAF
                Program Requisition Period at a monthly rental rate equal to the monthly rental
                rate in effect at the end of the Lease Term and the Expiration Date will be deemed
                to be the end of the CRAF Program Requisition Period.  If the Aircraft is
                requisitioned under the CRAF Program for a period which extends beyond the Lease
                Term, then LESSEE will provide LESSOR with written notice of the proposed
                redelivery at least six (6) months prior to such redelivery date and LESSEE must
                return the Aircraft in the condition required by Article 23 on the redelivery
                date set forth in such written notice.

24.15.2         LESSEE will promptly notify LESSOR in writing in the event of the requisition
                for use of the Aircraft under CRAF activation by the U.S. Government.  All of
                LESSEE's obligations under this Lease will continue to the same extent as if
                such requisition had not occurred.

24.15.3         Any provisions of this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, if there is a
                requisition for use of the Aircraft pursuant to the CRAF Program and/or CRAF
                activation, LESSOR agrees that LESSEE's insurances described in Exhibit E may
                be supplemented or replaced by insurances provided under Title XIII of the Act,
                and/or U.S. Government indemnification (which Title XIII insurances and
                indemnification will be, as to the Aircraft, in an amount not less than the Agreed
                Value and, as to all other insurances, in amounts not less than those established
                in Exhibit C); provided, however, that LESSEE will remain responsible for full
                compliance with all the provisions of this Lease, including Articles 17 and 19,
                to the extent Title XIII and/or the U.S. Government indemnification do not
                satisfy LESSEE's obligations under this Lease.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 38; page: 38" -->


24.15.4         If there is a requisition for use of the Aircraft pursuant to the CRAF Program
                and/or CRAF activation, there will be no limitation on the geographic area in
                which the Aircraft may be operated so long as, taken as a whole, LESSEE's
                insurance, the Title XIII insurance and/or the indemnification provided by the
                U.S. Government fully cover (without any geographic exclusions) LESSEE's Exhibit
                E insurance requirements.

24.15.5         If an Event of Default occurs under this Lease and LESSOR elects to pursue its
                remedies under Article 25.3.5 to terminate this Lease and repossess the Aircraft,
                LESSOR will so notify the U.S. Government by sending a written communication with
                a copy to LESSEE as follows:

                       Headquarters Air Mobility Command
                       AMC Contracting Office-- XOKA
                       Scott Air Force Base, Illinois 62225-5007

                or such other location as may be directed from time to time during the Lease Term.

24.15.6         So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all payments
                received by LESSOR or LESSEE from such Government Entity in connection with the
                requisition of the Aircraft under the CRAF Program (except payments on account
                of a Total Loss of the Aircraft) will be paid over to or retained by LESSEE.  If
                an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all payments received by
                LESSEE or LESSOR from such Government Entity in connection with the requisition
                of the Aircraft under the CRAF Program may be used by LESSOR to satisfy any
                obligations owing by LESSEE.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 25</u></b>           <b><u>ASSIGNMENT</u></b>


25.1            <b><u>No Assignment by LESSEE</u></b>.    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY ARTICLE 11 OR
ARTICLE 20.2.3, NO ASSIGNMENT, NOVATION, TRANSFER, MORTGAGE OR OTHER CHARGE MAY BE MADE BY
LESSEE OF ANY OF ITS RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT, ENGINE OR PART OR THIS LEASE.

25.2            <b><u>Sale or Assignment by LESSOR</u></b>.

25.2.1          Subject to LESSEE's rights pursuant to this Lease, LESSOR may at any time and
                without LESSEE's consent sell, assign or transfer its rights, interest and
                obligations hereunder, under any other Operative Document, or with respect to the
                Aircraft to a Permitted Transferee; provided, however, that no such transfer shall
               (a) cause any added expenses, costs or liabilities to LESSEE, (b) materially increase
                LESSEE's obligations hereunder (including but not limited to LESSEE's liabilities
                or obligations pursuant to Articles 16 or 17), or (c) materially adversely affect
                LESSEE's rights under this Lease.  For a period of two (2) years after such sale
                or assignment and at LESSEE's cost, LESSEE will continue to name LESSOR as an
                additional insured under the Aviation and Airline General Third Party Liability
                Insurance specified in Exhibit E.

25.2.2          The term "<b><u>LESSOR</u></b>" as used in this Lease means the lessor of the Aircraft at the
                time in question.  In the event of the sale of the Aircraft and transfer of
                LESSOR's rights and obligations under this Lease to a Permitted Transferee, such
                Permitted Transferee will become "LESSOR" of the Aircraft under this Lease and
                the transferring party (the prior "LESSOR") will be relieved of all liability to
                LESSEE under this Lease for obligations arising on and after the date the Aircraft
                is sold.  LESSEE will acknowledge and accept the Permitted Transferee as the new
                "LESSOR" under this Lease and will look solely to the Permitted Transferee for
                the performance of all LESSOR obligations and covenants under this Lease arising
                on and after the Aircraft sale date.

25.3            <b><u>LESSOR's Lender</u></b>.    Subject to LESSEE's rights pursuant to this Lease, LESSOR may
at any time and without LESSEE's consent grant security interests over the Aircraft and assign the
benefit of this Lease to a lender ("<b><u>LESSOR's Lender</u></b>") as security for LESSOR's obligations to
LESSOR's Lender.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 40; page: 40" -->


25.4            <b><u>LESSEE Cooperation</u></b>.    On request by LESSOR, LESSEE will execute all such
documents (such as a consent to a lease assignment agreement) as LESSOR may reasonably require
to confirm LESSEE's obligations under this Lease and obtain LESSEE's acknowledgment that LESSOR
is not in breach of the Lease.  LESSEE will provide all other reasonable assistance and
cooperation to LESSOR in connection with any such sale or assignment or the perfection and
maintenance of any such security interest, including, at LESSOR's cost, making all necessary
filings and registrations in the State of Registration and providing all opinions of counsel
with respect to matters reasonably requested by LESSOR.  LESSOR will reimburse LESSEE for its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) in reviewing
documents required by LESSOR and cooperating with a transfer pursuant to this ARTICLE 24.

25.5            <b><u>Protections</u></b>.

25.5.1          LESSOR will obtain for the benefit of LESSEE a written acknowledgment from any
                Permitted Transferee or LESSOR's Lender that, so long as no Event of Default
                has occurred and is continuing hereunder, neither such Person nor any Person
                claiming by, through or under such Person will not interfere with LESSEE's quiet,
                peaceful use and enjoyment of the Aircraft.

25.5.2          Wherever the term "LESSOR" is used in this Lease in relation to any of the
                provisions relating to disclaimer, title and registration, indemnity and insurance
                contained in Articles 8, 14, 17 and 18, respectively, or with respect to Article
                20.2.6, the term "LESSOR" will be deemed to include any Permitted Transferee and
                its lenders, if applicable. For avoidance of doubt, in the event of LESSOR's sale
                or financing of the Aircraft, the disclaimer and indemnity provisions contained
                in Articles 8 and 17 will continue to be applicable after the sale or assignment
                to International Lease Finance Corporation, as well as being applicable to any
                Permitted Transferee and its lenders.

         <b><u>ARTICLE 26</u></b>           <b><u>DEFAULT OF LESSEE</u></b>


26.1            <b><u>LESSEE Notice to LESSOR</u></b>.    LESSEE will promptly notify LESSOR if LESSEE becomes
aware of the occurrence of any Default.

26.2            <b><u>Events of Default</u></b>.    [SEE PARAGRAPH 19 OF EXHIBIT C]

26.3            <b><u>LESSOR's General Rights</u></b>.    Upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of
Default, LESSOR may do all or any of the following at its option (in addition to such other rights
and remedies which LESSOR may have by statute or otherwise but subject to any requirements of
applicable Law):

26.3.1          terminate this Lease by giving written notice to LESSEE;

26.3.2          require that LESSEE immediately move the Aircraft to an airport or other location
                designated by LESSOR;

26.3.3          for LESSEE's account, do anything that may reasonably be required to cure any
                default and recover from LESSEE all reasonable costs, including legal fees and
                expenses incurred in doing so and Default Interest;

26.3.4          proceed as appropriate to enforce performance of this Lease and to recover any
                damages for the breach hereof, including the amounts specified in Article 25.5;

26.3.5          terminate this Lease by taking possession of the Aircraft or by serving notice
                requiring LESSEE to return the Aircraft to LESSOR at the location specified by
                LESSOR.  If LESSOR takes possession of the Aircraft, it may enter upon LESSEE's
                premises where the Aircraft is located as permitted by applicable law.  Upon
                repossession of the Aircraft, LESSOR will then be entitled to sell, lease or
                otherwise deal with the Aircraft as if this Lease had never been made.  LESSOR
                will be entitled to the full benefit of its bargain with LESSEE as permitted by
                applicable Law; or

26.3.6          apply all or any portion of the Security Deposit and any other security deposits
                held by LESSOR pursuant to any other agreements between LESSOR and LESSEE to
                any amounts due.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 42; page: 42" -->


26.4            <b><u>Deregistration and Export of Aircraft</u></b>.    If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, LESSOR may take all steps necessary to deregister the Aircraft in and export
the Aircraft from the State of Registration.

26.5            <b><u>LESSEE Liability for Damages</u></b>.    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, LESSOR
has the right to recover from LESSEE and LESSEE will pay LESSOR within two (2) Business Days
after LESSOR's written demand, all of the following:

                (a)    all amounts which are then due and unpaid hereunder and which become due
                prior to the earlier of LESSOR's recovery of possession of the Aircraft or
                LESSEE making an effective tender thereof;

                (b)    subject to LESSOR's obligations at Law to mitigate its damages, any
                losses suffered by LESSOR because of LESSOR's inability to place the Aircraft
                on lease with another lessee or to otherwise utilize the Aircraft on financial
                terms as favorable to LESSOR as the terms hereof or, if LESSOR elects to dispose
                of the Aircraft, the funds arising from a sale or other disposition of the
                Aircraft are not as profitable to LESSOR as leasing the Aircraft in accordance
                with the terms hereof would have been (and LESSOR will be entitled to accelerate
                any and all Rent which would have been due from the date of LESSOR's recovery or
                repossession of the Aircraft through the Expiration Date);

                (c)    all costs associated with LESSOR's exercise of its remedies hereunder,
                including but not limited to repossession costs, legal fees, Aircraft storage
                costs and Aircraft re-lease or sale costs;

                (d)    any amount of principal, interest, fees or other sums paid or payable on
                account of funds borrowed in order to carry any unpaid amount;

                (e)    any loss, premium, penalty or expense which may be incurred in repaying
                funds raised to finance the Aircraft or in unwinding any financial instrument
                relating in whole or in part to LESSOR's financing of the Aircraft;

                (f)    direct expenses incurred by LESSOR to correct non-conformance of the
                Aircraft with return conditions in accordance with Article 23.11.4; and

                (g)    an amount sufficient to fully compensate LESSOR for any loss of or damage
                to the Aircraft caused by LESSEE's default.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 43; page: 43" -->


26.6            <b><u>Waiver of Default</u></b>.    By written notice to LESSEE, LESSOR may at its election
waive any Default or Event of Default and its consequences and rescind and annul any prior notice
of termination of this Lease.  The respective rights of the parties will then be as they would
have been had no Default or Event of Default occurred and no such notice been given.

26.7            <b><u>Present Value of Payments</u></b>.    In calculating LESSOR's damages hereunder, upon
an Event of Default all Rent and other amounts which would have been due hereunder during the
Lease Term if an Event of Default had not occurred will be calculated on a present value basis
using a discounting rate of six percent (6%) per annum discounted to the earlier of the date on
which LESSOR obtains possession of the Aircraft or LESSEE makes an effective tender thereof.

26.8            <b><u>Use of "Termination Date</u></b>.    For avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that if this
Lease terminates and the Aircraft is repossessed by LESSOR due to an Event of Default, then,
notwithstanding the use of the term "Termination Date" in this Lease, the period of the Lease
Term and the "Expiration Date" will be utilized in calculating the damages to which LESSOR is
entitled pursuant to Article 25.5.  For example, it is agreed and understood that LESSOR is
entitled to receive from LESSEE the Rent and the benefit of LESSEE's insurance and maintenance
of the Aircraft until expiration of the Lease Term.

26.9            <b><u>LESSEE's Remedies</u></b>.    Except as otherwise set forth in the Operative Documents,
upon a breach by LESSOR of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, LESSEE shall have all
rights available at law or in equity.

26.10           <b><u>Waiver of Consequential Damages</u></b>.    LESSEE and LESSOR each agree that it shall
not be entitled to recover, and hereby disclaims and waives any right that it may otherwise have
to recover, any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages as a result of any breach
or alleged breach by the other party of any of the agreements, representations or warranties
contained in this Lease or the other Operative Documents; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall be deemed to disclaim or waive any of LESSOR's remedies expressly set forth in Article 25.3.

out of any of the courts referred to above, (b) by personal service in accordance with the California

29.2            <b><u>Press Releases</u></b>.    The parties will give copies to one another, in advance if
possible, of all news, articles and other releases provided to the public media regarding this
Lease or the Aircraft.

29.3            <b><u>LESSOR Performance for LESSEE</u></b>.    The exercise by LESSOR of its remedy of
performing a LESSEE obligation hereunder is not a waiver of and will not relieve LESSEE from
the performance of such obligation at any subsequent time or from the performance of any of its
other obligations hereunder.

29.4            <b><u>LESSOR's Payment Obligations</u></b>.    Any obligation of LESSOR under this Lease to pay
or release any amount to LESSEE is conditioned upon and will be delayed until (a) all amounts then
due and payable by LESSEE to LESSOR under this Lease or under any other agreement between LESSOR
and LESSEE having been paid in full and (b) no payment or other material Default having occurred
and continuing hereunder at the time such payment or release of payment is payable to LESSEE.

29.5            <b><u>Application of Payments</u></b>.    Any amounts paid or recovered in respect of LESSEE
liabilities hereunder may be applied to Rent, Default Interest, fees or any other amount due
hereunder in such proportions, order and manner as LESSOR determines.

29.6            <b><u>Usury Laws</u></b>.    The parties intend to contract in strict compliance with the usury
Laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the U.S.  Notwithstanding anything

or other interest in excess of the maximum non-usurious interest rate, as in effect from time to
time, which may by applicable Law be charged, contracted for, reserved, received or collected by
LESSOR in connection with the Operative Documents.  During any period of time in which the then-
applicable highest lawful rate is lower than the Default Interest rate, Default Interest will accrue
and be payable at such highest lawful rate; however, if at later times such highest lawful rate is
greater than the Default Interest rate, then LESSEE will pay Default Interest at the highest lawful
rate until the Default Interest which is paid by LESSEE equals the amount of interest that would
have been payable in accordance with the interest rate set forth in Article 5.7.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 47; page: 47" -->


29.7            <b><u>Delegation by LESSOR</u></b>.    LESSOR may delegate to any Person(s) all or any of the
rights, powers or discretion vested in it by this Lease and any such delegation may be made upon
such terms and conditions as LESSOR in its absolute discretion thinks fit, provided that no such
delegation shall relieve LESSOR of any of its obligations hereunder.

29.8            <b><u>Rights of Parties</u></b>.    The rights of the parties hereunder are cumulative, not
exclusive, may be exercised as often as each party considers appropriate and are in addition to
its rights under general Law.  The rights of one party against the other party are not capable
of being waived or amended except by an express waiver or amendment in writing.  Any failure to
exercise or any delay in exercising any of such rights will not operate as a waiver or amendment
of that or any other such right any defective or partial exercise of any such rights will not
preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other such right and no act or course of
conduct or negotiation on a party's part or on its behalf will in any way preclude such party
from exercising any such right or constitute a suspension or any amendment of any such right.

29.9            <b><u>Further Assurances</u></b>.    Each party agrees from time to time to do and perform
such other and further acts and execute and deliver any and all such other instruments as may be

article, paragraph or section will be interpreted as a reference to such article, paragraph or
section of this Lease.

29.12           <b><u>Invalidity of Any Provision</u></b>.    If any of the provisions of this Lease become
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any Law, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or impaired.

29.13           <b><u>Time Is of the Essence</u></b>.    Time is of the essence in the performance of all
obligations of the parties under this Lease and, consequently, all time limitations set forth in
the provisions of this Lease will be strictly observed.

29.14           <b><u>Amendments in Writing</u></b>.    The provisions of this Lease may only be amended or
modified by a writing executed by LESSOR and LESSEE.



<!-- MARKER PAGE="sheet: 48; page: 48" -->


29.15           <b><u>Counterparts</u></b>.    This Lease may be executed in any number of identical counterparts,
each of which will be deemed to be an original, and all of which together will be deemed to be
one and the same instrument when each party has signed and delivered one such counterpart to the
other party.

29.16           <b><u>Delivery of Documents by Fax</u></b>.    Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Lease
or of any other documents in connection with this Lease by fax will be deemed as effective as
delivery of an originally executed counterpart.  Any party delivering an executed counterpart of
this Lease or other document by fax will also deliver an originally executed counterpart, but the
failure of any party to deliver an originally executed counterpart of this Lease or such other
document will not affect the validity or effectiveness of this Lease or such other document.

between the parties in relation to the leasing of the Aircraft by LESSOR to LESSEE and

guarantees or agreements, express or implied, except as set forth herein.
