In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the  applicable Borrowing available to the Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower  severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with  interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available  to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (i) in the case of a  payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, or (ii) in the case of a payment  to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan.  If such  Borrower and such Lender shall both pay such interest to the Agent for the same or an  overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such  interest paid by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays such amount to the  Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.

Thereafter, the applicable Borrower (or the Company on its behalf)  may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or, in the case of  a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this  Section and on terms consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement.  A Borrower  (or the Company on its behalf) may elect different options with respect to different portions  of an affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among  the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans resulting from  an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

Each Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Borrower shall not be permitted to  (i) change the currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period that does not comply  with Section 2.02(d) or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing not available to such  Borrower under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.  </FONT></DIV>

(a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder  or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees or otherwise)  prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such  payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to (i) in the case of payments  denominated in US Dollars, 12:00 noon, New York City time, and (ii) in the case of  payments denominated in a Designated Foreign Currency, the Applicable Time specified  by the Agent, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without  defense, set-off, recoupment or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on  any date may, in the discretion of the Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next  succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments  shall be made to the Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders to such account as the  Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company,  except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.18 and 9.03 shall be made  directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Agent shall distribute any such payments  received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly  following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day  that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding  Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be  payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder of principal or interest  in respect of any Loan shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the  currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document  shall be made in US Dollars.  Any payment required to be made by the Agent hereunder  shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Agent shall, at or before  such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the  regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Agent  to make such payment.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior  to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of any Lenders  hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that  such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in  reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due.  In  such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each applicable  Lender severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so  distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date  such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the  Overnight Rate.

(a) If  any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13 or 2.18, or if any Borrower is  required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for  the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable  efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its affected Loans or  other extensions of credit hereunder or to assign its affected rights and obligations  hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such  Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable  pursuant to Section 2.13, 2.15 or 2.18, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not  subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be  disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs  and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or  assignment.

The Company further agrees that if payment in  respect of any such Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a  place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any legal prohibition, disruption  of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment  of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in  the reasonable judgment of any Guaranteed Party, not consistent with the protection of its  rights or interests, then, at the election of such Guaranteed Party, the Company shall make  payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in  effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Guaranteed  Party against any losses or expenses (including losses or expenses resulting from  fluctuations in exchange rates) that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.  Upon payment in full by the Company of any Obligation of any Borrowing  Subsidiary, each Guaranteed Party shall, in a reasonable manner, assign to the Company  the amount of such Obligation owed to such Guaranteed Party and so paid, such assignment  to be pro tanto to the extent to which the Obligation in question was discharged by the  Company, or, if requested by the Company, make such disposition thereof as the Company  shall direct (all without recourse to any Guaranteed Party and without any representation  or warranty by any Guaranteed Party).  Upon payment by the Company of any sums as  provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a  result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be  subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all  the Obligations owed by such Borrowing Subsidiary to the Guaranteed Parties.  </FONT></DIV>

(b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any  party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the &#8220;Applicable Creditor&#8221;)  shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#8220;Judgment Currency&#8221;) other than  the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the &#8220;Agreement Currency&#8221;),  be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the  Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the  Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant  jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount  of the Agreement Currency which may be so purchased is less than the sum originally due  to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate  obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor  against such loss.  The obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 9.11 shall  survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing  hereunder.  </FONT></DIV>
