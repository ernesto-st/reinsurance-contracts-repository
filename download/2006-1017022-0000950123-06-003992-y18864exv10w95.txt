                        (ii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of

      law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan shall
      accrue at the Default Rate calculated from the date such payment was due
      without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein. Interest at
      the Default Rate shall be computed from the occurrence of the Event of
      Default until the actual receipt and collection of the Indebtedness (or
      that portion thereof that is then due). To the extent permitted by
      applicable law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the
      Indebtedness, shall itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan
      and shall be secured by this Agreement and the Pledge. This paragraph
      shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to extend the date of
      the payment of the Indebtedness, nor as a waiver of any other right or
      remedy accruing to Mezzanine Lender by reason of the occurrence of any
      Event of Default, and Mezzanine Lender retains its rights under the
      Mezzanine Note to accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the
      Indebtedness upon the happening of any Event of Default.

                  2.2.2 METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.

            (a) On each Payment Date, Mezzanine Borrower shall pay or cause to

            (b) All amounts advanced by Mezzanine Lender pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), other than the
Principal Amount, together with any interest at the Default Rate or other
charges as provided therein, shall be due and payable hereunder as provided in
the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine). In the event any such advance or charge is
not so repaid by Mezzanine Borrower, Mezzanine Lender may, at its option and
upon notice to Mezzanine Borrower, first apply any payments received under the
Mezzanine Note to repay such advances, together with any interest thereon, or
other charges as provided in the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), and the
balance, if any, shall be applied in payment of any installment of interest or
principal then due and payable.

            (c) The Maturity Date Payment shall be due and payable in full on
the Maturity Date.

                  2.2.3 LATE PAYMENT CHARGE. If any interest payment due under
the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) is not paid by Mezzanine Borrower within
five (5) days after the date on which it is due (or, if such fifth (5th) day is
not a Business Day, then the Business Day immediately following such day),
Mezzanine Borrower shall pay to Mezzanine Lender upon demand an amount equal to
the lesser of three percent (3%) of such unpaid sum or the Maximum Legal Rate
(the LATE PAYMENT CHARGE) in order to defray the expense incurred

                                       30
<PAGE>

by Mezzanine Lender in handling and processing such delinquent payment and to
compensate Mezzanine Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment.
Any such amount shall be secured by this Agreement, the Pledge and the other
Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Mezzanine Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the five day grace period with
respect to the applicability of the Late Payment Charge (i) shall only apply to
Mezzanine Borrower's first failure to make a monthly interest payment in any
calendar year and (ii) shall not constitute a payment grace period and shall in
no way limit Mezzanine Lender's rights under Article XVII.

                  2.2.4 USURY SAVINGS. This Agreement and the Mezzanine Note are
subject to the express condition that at no time shall Mezzanine Borrower be
obligated or required to pay interest on the Principal Amount of the Loan at a
rate which could subject Mezzanine Lender to either civil or criminal liability
as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the terms of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), Mezzanine Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the Principal Amount due
under the Mezzanine Note at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, then the
LIBOR Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be
immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in
excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in
reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due under the
Mezzanine Note. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Mezzanine Lender for the
use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that
the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the
Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the
Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

permitted except as set forth in Section 2.3.1 hereof and Section 4 of the

of Default, Mezzanine Lender shall accelerate the Indebtedness and Mezzanine
Borrower thereafter tenders payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness, or

            (a) Mezzanine Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Mezzanine
Lender to transfer (and pursuant to the Account Agreement (Third Mezzanine)
shall irrevocably authorize Cash Management Bank (Third Mezzanine) to execute
any corresponding instructions of Mezzanine Lender), and Mezzanine Lender shall
transfer (or cause Cash Management Bank to transfer pursuant to disbursement
instructions from Mezzanine Lender) to the Mezzanine Debt Service Reserve
Account, from the Third Mezzanine Account by 11:00 am New York time on the first
(1st) calendar day of each calendar month (and if such day is not a Business Day
then on the immediately preceding Business Day) or as soon thereafter as there
shall be sufficient collected funds on deposit in the Third Mezzanine Account,
and from time to time (but no less frequently than weekly thereafter) funds in
an amount equal to the sum of any Protective Advances which may have been
advanced by (and not previously reimbursed to) the Mezzanine Lender pursuant to
the terms of the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) to cure any Default or Event
of Default, any Default or Event of Default under any Senior Mezzanine Loan, any
Mortgage Default or Mortgage Event of Default, or to protect the Collateral
together with any interest payable on such amounts pursuant to the Loan
Documents (Third Mezzanine), plus (x) the unpaid Debt Service (Third Mezzanine)
for the next occurring Payment Date, plus (y) an amount equal to such payments
for any prior month(s), to the extent not previously paid, plus (z) an amount
equal to the amount, if any, deducted from the Third Mezzanine Account in any

                                       42
<PAGE>

preceding month to pay any other amounts then due under the Loan Documents
(Third Mezzanine) (other than any Debt Service (Third Mezzanine)). Mezzanine
Borrower acknowledges that Mezzanine Lender shall not be required to make such
withdrawal and deposit until such time as Mezzanine Lender is able to calculate
the amount of the Debt Service (Third Mezzanine) for the next occurring Payment
Date. As used herein, the term NET EXCESS CASH FLOW means the amount available
in the Third Mezzanine Account after the transfers to the Mezzanine Debt Service
Reserve Account required under this Section 3.1.5 have been made and the term
NET EXCESS CASH FLOW COMMENCEMENT DATE shall mean the date such amounts have
been fully funded or reserved within the Third Mezzanine Account in any given
calendar month.

            (b) If for any reason there will be insufficient amounts in the
Mezzanine Debt Service Reserve Account on any Payment Date to pay the Debt
Service (Third Mezzanine) due on such Payment Date, Mezzanine Borrower shall
immediately deposit into the Third Mezzanine Account an amount equal to the
shortfall of available funds in the Mezzanine Debt Service Reserve Account. Any
failure by Mezzanine Borrower to deposit the full amount required by the
preceding sentence shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder. If Mezzanine
Lender shall reasonably determine that there will be insufficient amounts in the
Third Mezzanine Account to pay any Protective Advances as and when the same are
due and payable, Mezzanine Lender shall provide written notice of same to
Mezzanine Borrower setting forth the basis for such determination. Within five
(5) Business Days of receipt of said notice, Mezzanine Borrower shall deposit
into the Third Mezzanine Account an amount equal to the shortfall of available
funds in the Third Mezzanine Account. Any failure by Mezzanine Borrower to
deposit the full amount required by the preceding sentence within said five (5)
Business Day period shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder.

            (c) Provided that (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine),
(ii) no Mortgage Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii)
no Senior Mezzanine Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (iv)
Mezzanine Borrower shall have delivered to Mezzanine Lender an Officer's
Certificate (which Mezzanine Borrower shall not be obligated to deliver more
frequently than once per calendar month) certifying that the signatories know of
no Event of Default, Mortgage Event of Default or Senior Mezzanine Event of
Default (as applicable) that has occurred and is then outstanding hereunder or
under any of the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), Senior Mezzanine Loan
Documents, or under any of the Loan Documents (Mortgage), and (v) Mezzanine
Borrower shall have deposited into the Third Mezzanine Account all funds then
required to have been so deposited, then Mezzanine Lender shall transfer the Net
Excess Cash Flow from the Third Mezzanine Account to (A) the Fourth Mezzanine
Account, or (B) following the repayment of the Fourth Mezzanine Loan, and
provided that the Fifth Mezzanine Lender shall have funded the Fifth Mezzanine
Loan on or before the Outside Date, to the Fifth Mezzanine Account or (C )
following the repayment of the Fourth Mezzanine Loan, and the Fifth Mezzanine
Loan, to the Mezzanine Borrower's Account.

            (d) In the event that an Event of Default shall have occurred and is
then continuing, then, without notice from Mezzanine Lender, all Net Excess Cash
Flow shall be applied to reduce the outstanding Principal Amount of the
Mezzanine Note. At such time that the Event of Default shall no longer be
continuing and provided no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing under the Mortgage Loan, any Senior Mezzanine Loan, or

                                       43
<PAGE>

Mezzanine Loan, then all Net Excess Cash Flow shall be distributed in accordance
with the provision of subsection (c) above.

            (e) Mezzanine Lender (so long as Mezzanine Lender is not the same
entity as Mortgage Lender) agrees to deliver to Mortgage Lender a monthly notice
letter (the MEZZANINE LENDER MONTHLY DEBT SERVICE NOTICE LETTER) at least five
(5) Business Days prior to each Payment Date setting forth the Debt Service
(Third Mezzanine) payable by Mezzanine Borrower on the first Payment Date
occurring after the date such notice is delivered.

            (f) Mezzanine Borrower hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to Section
3.1.5 of the Second Mezzanine Loan Agreement, (i) to the extent the Second
Mezzanine Lender has received notice from Mezzanine Lender that an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing under the Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) (a MEZZANINE LOAN DEFAULT NOTICE) and until such time as Second
Mezzanine Lender receives a notice from Mezzanine Lender that such Event of
Default is no longer continuing (a MEZZANINE LOAN DEFAULT REVOCATION NOTICE),
the Second Mezzanine Borrower has irrevocably directed that Excess Cash Flow is
to be deposited directly into the Third Mezzanine Account for application as
provided in this Agreement (in lieu of transferring such funds to such accounts
of the Junior Mezzanine Borrowers or Second Mezzanine Borrower as the Second
Mezzanine Borrower may have so directed if the Second Mezzanine Lender had not
received such notice from Mezzanine Lender), (ii) to the extent Second Mezzanine
Lender has not received a Mezzanine Loan default notice but has received a
Fourth Mezzanine Loan Default Notice and until such time as Second Mezzanine
Lender receives a Fourth Mezzanine Loan Default Revocation Notice, Second
Mezzanine Borrower irrevocably directs that all Excess Cash Flow be deposited
directly into the Fourth Mezzanine Account for application as provided in the
Fourth Mezzanine Loan Agreement (in lieu of transferring such funds to such
accounts of Second Mezzanine Borrower as Second Mezzanine Borrower may have so
directed if Second Mezzanine Lender had not received such notice from Fourth
Mezzanine Lender) and (iii) the directions described in the preceding clauses
(i) or (ii) shall not be changed or terminated without the written consent of
the Mezzanine Lender. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
provided no Event of Default has occurred or is continuing, there shall be
disbursed to Mezzanine Borrower the Proceeds of a Condemnation or Casualty
remaining after payment of all amounts to which Mortgage Lender, each Senior
Mezzanine Lender, Mezzanine Lender and each Junior Mezzanine Lender are
entitled. Mezzanine Borrower agrees that Mezzanine Lender shall not be required
to deliver to Second Mezzanine Lender a Mezzanine Loan Default Notice prior to
the deposit of Proceeds into the Mezzanine Account.

                  3.1.7 CASH MANAGEMENT BANK.

            (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the Cash Management Bank
(Third Mezzanine) named herein shall be deemed to be an Approved Bank; provided,
however, that the term "Approved Bank" shall be applicable for all other

Bank (Third Mezzanine). Mezzanine Lender shall have the right at Mezzanine
Borrower's sole cost and expense to replace the Cash Management Bank (Third
Mezzanine) with a financial institution reasonably satisfactory to Mezzanine
Borrower in the event that (i) the Cash

the Account Agreement (Third Mezzanine), (ii) the Cash Management Bank (Third
Mezzanine) named herein is no longer the Cash Management Bank (Third Mezzanine)
or (iii) the Cash Management Bank (Third Mezzanine) is no longer an Approved

            (b) During the term of the Loan, so long as no Event of Default

expense, shall have the right to replace the Cash Management Bank (Third
Mezzanine) with a financial institution that is an Approved Bank provided such
institution shall execute and deliver to Mezzanine Lender (with a copy to
Mortgage Lender) the Account Agreement (Third Mezzanine) (and Mezzanine Lender
shall reasonably cooperate with Mezzanine Borrower in connection with such
transfer). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Mezzanine Lender shall have the right at Mezzanine Borrower's sole cost
and expense to replace Cash Management Bank at any time, without notice to
Mezzanine Borrower. Mezzanine Borrower shall cooperate with Mezzanine Lender in

and hold Mezzanine Lender, its employees and officers harmless from and against

resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other

create a continuing security interest in the Account Collateral (Third
Mezzanine) and shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of
the Indebtedness; provided, however, such security interest shall automatically
terminate with respect to funds which were duly deposited into Mezzanine

or to authorize Mezzanine Borrower, Mortgage Borrower, Borrower Parents,
Borrower Subsidiary, or Affiliate Tenant to do so or (ii) file an involuntary

Borrower, Mortgage Borrower, Borrower Parents, Borrower Subsidiary, or Affiliate
Tenant shall be permitted to (i) dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge or sell

activity and such restrictions shall not be modified or violated for so long as

                  5.1.6 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. Mezzanine Borrower shall promptly
advise Mezzanine Lender (a) of any event or condition that has or is likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect and (b) of the occurrence of any Default, Event
of Default, Mortgage Default or Mortgage Event of Default of which Mezzanine
Borrower has knowledge.

                  5.1.7 COOPERATE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Mezzanine Borrower shall
cooperate (and shall cause Mortgage Borrower to cooperate) fully with Mezzanine
Lender with respect to any proceedings before any court, board or other
Governmental Authority which would reasonably be expected to affect in any
material adverse way the rights of Mezzanine Lender hereunder or under any of
the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) and, in connection therewith, permit
Mezzanine Lender, at its election, to participate in any such proceedings which
may have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  5.1.8 PERFORM LOAN DOCUMENTS (THIRD MEZZANINE). Mezzanine
Borrower shall observe, perform and satisfy all the terms, provisions, covenants
and conditions of, and shall pay when due all costs, fees and expenses to the
extent required, under the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) executed and
delivered by, or applicable to, Mezzanine Borrower.

                  5.1.9 FURTHER ASSURANCES; SEPARATE NOTES.

            (a) Mezzanine Borrower shall, at its cost and expense, execute and
acknowledge (or cause to be executed and acknowledged) and deliver to Mezzanine
Lender all documents, and take all actions, reasonably required by Mezzanine
Lender from time to time to confirm the rights created or now or hereafter
intended to be created under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) and any security interest created or purported to be created
thereunder, to protect and further the validity, priority and enforceability of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), to subject to the
Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) any property of Mezzanine Borrower intended by
the terms of any one or more of the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) to be
encumbered by the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), or otherwise carry out the
purposes of the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) and the transactions
contemplated thereunder. Mezzanine Borrower agrees that it shall, upon request,
reasonably cooperate with Mezzanine Lender in connection with any request by
Mezzanine Lender to sever the Mezzanine Note into two (2) or more separate
substitute or component notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
Principal Amount and to

                                       60
<PAGE>

reapportion the Loan among such separate substitute notes, including, without
limitation, by executing and delivering to Mezzanine Lender new substitute notes
to replace the Mezzanine Note, amendments to or replacements of existing Loan
Documents (Third Mezzanine) to reflect such severance and/or Opinions of Counsel
with respect to such substitute notes, amendments and/or replacements, and the
holders of such substitute or component notes shall designate a lead lender or
agent for such holders to whom Mezzanine Borrower may direct all communications
with respect to the Loan. Any such substitute or component notes may have
varying principal amounts and economic terms, provided, however, that (i) the
maturity date of any such substitute note shall be the same as the scheduled
Maturity Date of the Mezzanine Note immediately prior to the issuance of such
substitute notes, (ii) the substitute notes shall provide for amortization of
the Principal Amount on a weighted average basis over a period not less than the
amortization period provided under the Mezzanine Note, if any, immediately prior
to the issuance of the substitute notes, (iii) the weighted average LIBOR Margin
(Third Mezzanine) of the substitute notes shall not exceed the LIBOR Margin
(Third Mezzanine) under the Mezzanine Note immediately prior to the issuance of
such substitute notes; and (iv) the economics of the Loan, taken as a whole,
shall not change in a manner which is adverse to Mezzanine Borrower. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a material Event of Default (as
determined by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion), Mezzanine Lender may
apply payment of all sums due under such substitute notes in such order and
priority as Mezzanine Lender shall elect in its sole and absolute discretion.

            (b) Mezzanine Borrower further agrees that if, in connection with
the Securitization, it is determined by the Rating Agencies that a portion of
the Securitization would not receive an "investment grade" rating unless the
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan were to be decreased and, as a result, the
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan is decreased, then (i) the Mezzanine
Borrower shall take all actions as are necessary to effect the "resizing" of the
Loan and the Mortgage Loan, (ii) the Mezzanine Borrower shall cause the Senior
Mezzanine Borrowers and the Mortgage Borrower to comply with its agreements to
effect a "resizing", and (iii) Mezzanine Lender shall on the date of the
"resizing" of the Loan lend to the Mezzanine Borrower (by way of a reallocation
of the principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and the Loan) such additional
amount equal to the amount of the principal reduction of the Loan (in which case
the Prepayment Fee shall be inapplicable to such repayment) provided that
Mortgage Borrower and Mezzanine Borrower execute and deliver any and all
necessary amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents (Mortgage) and the
Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine). In addition, Mezzanine Borrower and Mezzanine
Lender agree that if, in connection with the Securitization, it is determined by
the Rating Agencies that, if the principal amount of the Loan were to be
decreased and, as a result the principal amount of the Mortgage Loan were
increased, more "investment grade" rated securities could be issued, then (i) if
"resizing" to increase the size of the Mortgage Loan and decrease the size of
the Loan is provided for in the Loan Documents (Mortgage), each of them shall
take all actions provided for in the documentation for the Loan as are necessary
to effect the "resizing" of the Loan and the Mortgage Loan, (ii) Mezzanine
Borrower shall cause the Mortgage Borrower to comply with its agreements to
effect a "resizing" and (iii) Mortgage Lender shall on the date of the
"resizing" of the Loan lend to the Mortgage Borrower (by way of a reallocation
of the principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and the Loan) an additional amount
equal to the amount of principal reduction of the Loan, provided that Mortgage
Borrower and Mezzanine Borrower execute and deliver any and all necessary
modifications to the Loan Documents (Mortgage) and Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine). In

                                       61
<PAGE>

connection with the foregoing, Mezzanine Borrower agrees, at Mezzanine
Borrower's sole cost and expense, to execute and deliver such documents and
other agreements reasonably required by Mortgage Lender and/or Mezzanine Lender
to "re-size" the Loan and the Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, an
amendment to this Agreement, the Mezzanine Note, the Pledge and the other Loan
Documents (Mortgage) and, if the principal amount of the Mortgage Loan is
increased, an endorsement to the Title Policy reflecting an increase in the
insured amount thereunder. Mezzanine Borrower agrees to reimburse Mezzanine
Lender for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by Mezzanine Lender in connection with
any "resizing" of the Loan and to pay for any additional "Eagle 9" or other UCC
insurance coverage reasonably required by Mezzanine Lender in connection with
any increase in the principal amount of any Mezzanine Loan, and shall deliver
opinions of counsel similar to those delivered on the date hereof with respect
to Mezzanine Borrower and the Mezzanine Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Mezzanine Lender agrees that any "resizing" of the Mortgage Loan and the Loan
shall not change the economics of the Mortgage Loan, Mezzanine Loan, Junior
Mezzanine Loans and the Loan taken as a whole in a manner which is adverse to
Mezzanine Borrower.

            (c) In addition, Mezzanine Borrower shall, at Mezzanine Borrower's
sole cost and expense:

                        (i) furnish to Mezzanine Lender, to the extent not
      otherwise already furnished to Mezzanine Lender and reasonably acceptable
      to Mezzanine Lender, all instruments, documents, boundary surveys, footing
      or foundation surveys, certificates, plans and specifications, appraisals,
      title and other insurance reports and agreements, and each and every other
      document, certificate, agreement and instrument required to be furnished
      by Mortgage Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents
      (Mortgage);

                        (ii) execute and deliver, from time to time, such
      further instruments (including, without limitation, authorize or deliver
      of any financing statements under the UCC) as may be reasonably requested
      by Mezzanine Lender to confirm the lien of the Pledge and this Agreement
      or any Collateral;

                        (iii) execute and deliver to Mezzanine Lender such
      documents, instruments, certificates, assignments and other writings, and
      do such other acts necessary to evidence, preserve and/or protect the
      collateral at any time securing or intended to secure the obligations of
      Mezzanine Borrower under the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), as
      Mezzanine Lender may reasonably require;

                        (iv) do and execute all and such further lawful and
      reasonable acts, conveyances and assurances for the carrying out of the
      terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (Third
      Mezzanine), as Mezzanine Lender shall reasonably require from time to
      time; and

                        (v) cause its New York counsel to re-issue the New York
      opinion delivered on the date hereof (in identical form and without
      updating) in favor of any purchaser of the Loan or an interest therein.

remedies of the Mortgage Lender thereunder including without limitation, all
rights of consent and approval, rights to receive and control the disposition of

Borrower to pay all Impositions, to timely pay all claims for labor, material or

any Lien (other than the lien of the Loan Documents (Mortgage) and the Permitted
Encumbrances), and shall in any event cause the prompt, full and unconditional
discharge of all Liens imposed upon the Property or any portion thereof within
thirty (30) days after receiving written notice (whether from Mezzanine Lender,
the lienholder or any other Person) of the filing thereof; subject in each case
to Mortgage Borrower's right to contest the same as permitted in but subject to
the conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement (Mortgage) so long as no Event of
Default has occurred. In the event that Mortgage Borrower elects to commence any
contest or similar proceeding with respect to any such Imposition, Lien or other
claim described herein, Mezzanine Borrower shall provide prompt written notice
thereof to Mezzanine Lender together with such evidence as Mezzanine Lender may
reasonably require showing Mortgage Borrower's satisfaction of the requirements

such contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mezzanine Borrower shall cause

            (b) The Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) is free and clear of
all claims or security interests of every nature whatsoever, except such as are
created pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine), and Mezzanine Borrower has the right to pledge and grant a security

any other Person other than any such consent that has been obtained and is in
full force and effect.

            (c) The Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) has been duly and
validly pledged hereunder. All consents and approvals required to be obtained by
Mezzanine Borrower for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been obtained.

            (d) Giving effect to the aforesaid grant and assignment to Mezzanine

            SECTION 9.5 PAYMENTS. If Mezzanine Borrower at any time shall be
entitled to receive any payments with respect to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement

            SECTION 9.6 REMEDIES. Subject to the provisions of the Interest Rate
Cap Agreement (Third Mezzanine), if an Event of Default shall occur and then be
continuing:

            (a) Mezzanine Lender, without obligation to resort to any other
security, right or remedy granted under any other agreement or instrument, shall
have the right to, in addition to all rights, powers and remedies of a secured
party pursuant to the UCC, at any time and from time to time, sell, resell,
assign and deliver, in its sole discretion, any or all of the Rate Cap
Collateral (Third Mezzanine) (in one or more parcels and at the same or
different times) and all right, title and interest, claim and demand therein and
right of redemption thereof, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or
for future delivery, and in connection therewith Mezzanine Lender may grant
options and may impose reasonable conditions such as requiring any purchaser to
represent that any "securities" constituting any part of the Rate Cap Collateral
(Third Mezzanine) are being purchased for investment only, Mezzanine Borrower
hereby waiving and releasing any and all equity or right of redemption to the
fullest extent permitted by the UCC or applicable law. If all or any of the Rate
Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) is sold by Mezzanine Lender upon credit or for
future delivery, Mezzanine Lender shall not be liable for the failure of the
purchaser to purchase or pay for the same and, in the event of any such failure,
Mezzanine

                                       86
<PAGE>

Lender may resell such Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine). It is expressly
agreed that Mezzanine Lender may exercise its rights with respect to less than
all of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine), leaving unexercised its rights
with respect to the remainder of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine),
provided, however, that such partial exercise shall in no way restrict or
jeopardize Mezzanine Lender's right to exercise its rights with respect to all
or any other portion of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) at a later
time or times.

            (b) Mezzanine Lender may exercise, either by itself or by its
nominee or designee, in the name of Mezzanine Borrower, all of Mezzanine
Lender's rights, powers and remedies in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral
(Third Mezzanine), hereunder and under law.

            (c) Mezzanine Borrower hereby irrevocably, in the name of Mezzanine
Borrower or otherwise, authorizes and empowers Mezzanine Lender and assigns and
transfers unto Mezzanine Lender, and constitutes and appoints Mezzanine Lender
its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, and as its agent, irrevocably, with full
power of substitution for Mezzanine Borrower and in the name of Mezzanine
Borrower, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
(i) to exercise and enforce every right, power, remedy, authority, option and
privilege of Mezzanine Borrower under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third
Mezzanine), including any power to subordinate or modify the Interest Rate Cap
Agreement (Third Mezzanine) (but not, unless an Event of Default exists and is
continuing, the right to terminate or cancel the Interest Rate Cap Agreement
(Third Mezzanine)), or to give any notices, or to take any action resulting in
such subordination, termination, cancellation or modification and (ii) in order
to more fully vest in Mezzanine Lender the rights and remedies provided for
herein, to exercise all of the rights, remedies and powers granted to Mezzanine
Lender in this Agreement, and Mezzanine Borrower further authorizes and empowers
Mezzanine Lender, as Mezzanine Borrower's attorney-in-fact, and as its agent,
irrevocably, with full power of substitution for Mezzanine Borrower and in the
name of Mezzanine Borrower, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, to give any authorization, to furnish any information, to make
any demands, to execute any instruments and to take any and all other action on
behalf of and in the name of Mezzanine Borrower which in the opinion of
Mezzanine Lender may be necessary or appropriate to be given, furnished, made,
exercised or taken under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third Mezzanine), in
order to comply therewith, to perform the conditions thereof or to prevent or
remedy any default by Mezzanine Borrower thereunder or to enforce any of the
rights of Mezzanine Borrower thereunder. These powers-of-attorney are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and any similar or dissimilar powers
heretofore given by Mezzanine Borrower in respect of the Rate Cap Collateral
(Third Mezzanine) to any other Person are hereby revoked.

            (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Mezzanine Lender may, without notice to, or assent by, Mezzanine
Borrower or any other Person (to the extent permitted by law), but without
affecting any of the Obligations (Third Mezzanine), in the name of Mezzanine
Borrower or in the name of Mezzanine Lender, notify the Counterparty, or if
applicable, any other counterparty to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third
Mezzanine), to make payment and performance directly to Mezzanine Lender; extend
the time of payment and performance of, compromise or settle for cash, credit or
otherwise, and upon any terms and conditions, any obligations owing to Mezzanine
Borrower, or claims of Mezzanine Borrower, under the Interest Rate Cap Agreement
(Third Mezzanine); file any claims, commence,

                                       87
<PAGE>

maintain or discontinue any actions, suits or other proceedings deemed by
Mezzanine Lender necessary or advisable for the purpose of collecting upon or
enforcing the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third Mezzanine); and execute any
instrument and do all other things deemed necessary and proper by Mezzanine
Lender to protect and preserve and realize upon the Rate Cap Collateral (Third
Mezzanine) and the other rights contemplated hereby.

            (e) Pursuant to the powers-of-attorney provided for above, Mezzanine
Lender may take any action and exercise and execute any instrument which it may
deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof; provided,
however, that Mezzanine Lender shall not be permitted to take any action
pursuant to said power-of-attorney that would conflict with any limitation on
Mezzanine Lender's rights with respect to the Rate Cap Collateral (Third
Mezzanine). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Mezzanine Lender,
after the occurrence of an Event of Default, shall have the right and power to
receive, endorse and collect all checks and other orders for the payment of
money made payable to Mezzanine Borrower representing: (i) any payment of
obligations owed pursuant to the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third Mezzanine),
(ii) interest accruing on any of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) or
(iii) any other payment or distribution payable in respect of the Rate Cap
Collateral (Third Mezzanine) or any part thereof, and for and in the name, place
and stead of Mezzanine Borrower, to execute endorsements, assignments or other
instruments of conveyance or transfer in respect of any property which is or may
become a part of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) hereunder.

            (f) Mezzanine Lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of
a secured party under the UCC.

            (g) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement or any of
Mezzanine Borrower's rights hereunder, and without waiving or releasing
Mezzanine Borrower from any obligation or default hereunder, Mezzanine Lender
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to perform any act or take any
appropriate action, as it, in its reasonable judgment, may deem necessary to
protect the security of this Agreement, to cure such Event of Default or to
cause any term, covenant, condition or obligation required under this Agreement
or the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third Mezzanine) to be performed or observed
by Mezzanine Borrower to be promptly performed or observed on behalf of
Mezzanine Borrower. All amounts advanced by, or on behalf of, Mezzanine Lender
in exercising its rights under this Section 9.7(g) (including, but not limited
to, reasonable legal expenses and disbursements incurred in connection
therewith), together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of
each such advance, shall be payable by Mezzanine Borrower to Mezzanine Lender
upon demand and shall be secured by this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.7 SALES OF RATE CAP COLLATERAL (THIRD MEZZANINE). No
demand, advertisement or notice, all of which are, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, hereby expressly waived by Mezzanine Borrower, shall be
required in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or any part of
the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine), except that Mezzanine Lender shall
give Mezzanine Borrower at least thirty (30) Business Days' prior written notice
of the time and place of any public sale or of the time when and the place where
any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which notice Mezzanine
Borrower hereby agrees is reasonable, all other demands, advertisements and
notices being hereby waived. To the

                                       88
<PAGE>

extent permitted by law, Mezzanine Lender shall not be obligated to make any
sale of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) if it shall determine not to
do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale may have been given, and
Mezzanine Lender may without notice or publication adjourn any public or private
sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place
to which the same was so adjourned. Upon each private sale of the Rate Cap
Collateral (Third Mezzanine) of a type customarily sold in a recognized market
and upon each public sale, unless prohibited by any applicable statute which
cannot be waived, Mezzanine Lender (or its nominee or designee) may purchase any
or all of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) being sold, free and
discharged from any trusts, claims, equity or right of redemption of Mezzanine
Borrower, all of which are hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by
law, and may make payment therefor by credit against any of the Obligations
(Third Mezzanine) in lieu of cash or any other obligations. In the case of all
sales of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine), public or private, Mezzanine
Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind for sale or
delivery, including brokers' and attorneys' fees and disbursements and any tax
imposed thereon. However, the proceeds of sale of Rate Cap Collateral (Third
Mezzanine) shall be available to cover such costs and expenses, and, after
deducting such costs and expenses from the proceeds of sale, Mezzanine Lender
shall apply any residue to the payment of the Obligations (Third Mezzanine) in
the order of priority as set forth in Section 17.5.

            SECTION 9.8 PUBLIC SALES NOT POSSIBLE. Mezzanine Borrower
acknowledges that the terms of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (Third Mezzanine)
may prohibit public sales, that the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) may
not be of the type appropriately sold at public sales, and that such sales may
be prohibited by law. In light of these considerations, Mezzanine Borrower
agrees that private sales of the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) shall not
be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonably manner by mere virtue
of having been made privately.

            SECTION 9.9 RECEIPT OF SALE PROCEEDS. Upon any sale of the Rate Cap
Collateral (Third Mezzanine) by Mezzanine Lender hereunder (whether by virtue of
the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial process or otherwise),
the receipt by Mezzanine Lender or the officer making the sale or the proceeds
of such sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of
the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) so sold, and such purchaser or
purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the
purchase money paid over to Mezzanine Lender or such officer or be answerable in
any way for the misapplication or non-application thereof.

            SECTION 9.10 EXTENSION INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT (THIRD
MEZZANINE). If Mezzanine Borrower exercises any of its options to extend the
Maturity Date pursuant to Section 5 of the Note, then, on or prior to the
Maturity Date being extended, the Mezzanine Borrower shall obtain or have in
place an Extension Interest Rate Cap Agreement (i) having a term through the end
of the Interest Period in which the extended Maturity Date occurs, (ii) in a
notional amount at least equal to the Principal Amount of the Loan as of the
Maturity Date being extended, and (iii) having a strike rate equal to an amount
such that the maximum interest rate paid by the Mezzanine Borrower after giving
effect to payments made under such Extension Interest Rate Cap Agreement shall
equal no more than the Maximum LIBOR Pay Rate (Third Mezzanine).

requested by Mezzanine Lender, such reasonable additional information as may be

            SECTION 12.2 COVENANTS.

                  12.2.1 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Subject to Mortgage
Borrower's right to contest under Section 7.3 of the Loan Agreement (Mortgage),
Mezzanine Borrower covenants and agrees with Mezzanine Lender that it shall

all Environmental Laws. If at any time during the continuance of the Lien of the
Security Instrument and/or Pledge, a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over the Property requires remedial action to correct the presence of Hazardous
Materials in, around, or under the Property (an ENVIRONMENTAL EVENT), Mezzanine
Borrower shall deliver prompt notice of the occurrence of such Environmental

forth the proposed remedial action, if any. Mezzanine Borrower shall promptly
provide Mezzanine Lender with copies of all notices which allege or identify any

order, claim, pleading, letter, application, filing, report, findings,
declarations or other materials pertinent to compliance of the Property and
Mezzanine Borrower with such Environmental Laws.

                  12.2.2 RESERVED.

            SECTION 12.3 ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. Upon the occurrence and during

Event of Default,

                                       91
<PAGE>

Mezzanine Lender shall have the right to have its consultants perform a
comprehensive environmental audit of the Property. Such audit shall be conducted
by an environmental consultant chosen by Mezzanine Lender and may include a
visual survey, a record review, an area reconnaissance assessing the presence of
hazardous or toxic waste or substances, PCBs or storage tanks at the Property,
an asbestos survey of the Property, which may include random sampling of the
Improvements and air quality testing, and such further site assessments as
Mezzanine Lender may reasonably require due to the results obtained from the
foregoing. Mezzanine Borrower grants (and shall cause Mortgage Borrower to
grant) to Mezzanine Lender, its agents, consultants and contractors the right to
enter the Property as reasonable or appropriate for the circumstances for the
purposes of performing such studies and the reasonable cost of such studies
shall be due and payable by Mezzanine Borrower to Mezzanine Lender upon demand
and shall be secured by the Lien of this Agreement and the Pledge. Mezzanine
Lender shall not unreasonably interfere with (and shall cause Mortgage Borrower
not to unreasonably interfere with), and Mezzanine Lender shall direct the
environmental consultant to use its commercially reasonable efforts not to
hinder, Mortgage Borrower's or any Tenant's, other occupant's or Manager's
operations upon the Property when conducting such audit, sampling or
inspections. By undertaking any of the measures identified in and pursuant to
this Section 12.3, Mezzanine Lender shall not be deemed to be exercising any
control over the operations of Mezzanine Borrower or Mortgage Borrower or the
handling of any environmental matter or hazardous wastes or substances of
Mezzanine Borrower or Mortgage Borrower for purposes of incurring or being
subject to liability therefor.

            SECTION 12.4 ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNIFICATION. Mezzanine Borrower shall
protect, indemnify, save, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from
and against any and all liability, loss, damage, actions, causes of action,
costs or expenses whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
and any and all claims, suits and judgments which any Indemnified Party may
suffer, as a result of or with respect to: (a) any Environmental Claim relating
to or arising from the Property; (b) the violation of any Environmental Law in
connection with the Property; (c) any release, spill, or the presence of any
Hazardous Materials affecting the Property; and (d) the presence at, in, on or
under, or the release, escape, seepage, leakage, discharge or migration at or
from, the Property of any Hazardous Materials, whether or not such condition was
known or unknown to Mezzanine Borrower; provided that, in each case, Mezzanine
Borrower shall be relieved of its obligation under this subsection if any of the
matters referred to in clauses (a) through (d) above did not occur (but need not
have been discovered) prior to the foreclosure of the Pledge. If any such action
or other proceeding shall be brought against Mezzanine Lender, upon written
notice from Mezzanine Borrower to Mezzanine Lender (given reasonably promptly
following Mezzanine Lender's notice to Mezzanine Borrower of such action or
proceeding), Mezzanine Borrower shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof,
at Mezzanine Borrower's expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Mezzanine
Lender; provided, however, Mezzanine Lender may, at its own expense, retain
separate counsel to participate in such defense, but such participation shall
not be deemed to give Mezzanine Lender a right to control such defense, which
right Mezzanine Borrower expressly retains. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at Mezzanine
Borrower's expense if, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and Mezzanine Borrower
that would make such separate representation advisable. Mezzanine Borrower shall
have no

                                       92
<PAGE>

obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party for damage or loss resulting from
such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            SECTION 12.5 RECOURSE NATURE OF CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATIONS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement or in any
other Loan Document (Third Mezzanine), the indemnification provided in Section
12.4 shall be fully recourse to Mezzanine Borrower and shall be independent of,
and shall survive, the discharge of the Indebtedness, the release of the Lien
created by the Pledge, and/or the conveyance of title to the Collateral to
Mezzanine Lender or any purchaser or designee in connection with a foreclosure
of the Pledge or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure.

occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all or any one or
more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Mezzanine
Lender against Mezzanine Borrower and Guarantor under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) executed and delivered by, or
applicable to, Mezzanine Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by
Mezzanine Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of
the Indebtedness shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Mezzanine
Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the
enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) with respect to the Collateral. Any such actions taken by Mezzanine
Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently,
singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Mezzanine Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and
remedies of Mezzanine Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set
forth herein or in the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Mezzanine Borrower agrees that if an Event of
Default is continuing (i) Mezzanine Lender shall not be subject to any one
action or election of remedies law or rule and (ii) all liens and other rights,
remedies or privileges provided to Mezzanine Lender shall remain in full force
and effect until Mezzanine Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the
Collateral and this Agreement and the Pledge have been foreclosed, sold and/or
otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the Indebtedness or the Indebtedness
has been paid in full.

            (b) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Mezzanine Lender
may, but without any obligation to do so and without notice to or demand on
Mezzanine Borrower and without releasing Mezzanine Borrower from any obligation
hereunder, take any action to cure such Event of Default. Mezzanine Lender may
appear in, defend, or bring any action or proceeding to protect its interests in
the Collateral or to foreclose its security interest under this Agreement and
the Pledge or under any of the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) or collect
the Indebtedness.

            (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, with respect to the Account Collateral (Third Mezzanine), the Mezzanine
Lender may:

                        (i) without notice to Mezzanine Borrower, except as
      required by law, and at any time or from time to time, charge, set-off and
      otherwise apply all or any part of the Account Collateral (Third
      Mezzanine) against the Obligations (Third Mezzanine) or any part thereof;

                        (ii) in Mezzanine Lender's sole discretion, at any time
      and from time to time, exercise any and all rights and remedies available
      to it under this Agreement, and/or as a secured party under the UCC;

                        (iii) demand, collect, take possession of or receipt
      for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon the
      Account Collateral (Third Mezzanine) (or any portion thereof) as Mezzanine
      Lender may determine in its sole discretion; and

<PAGE>

                        (iv) take all other actions provided in, or contemplated
      by, this Agreement.

            (d) With respect to Mezzanine Borrower, the Account Collateral
(Third Mezzanine), the Rate Cap Collateral (Third Mezzanine) and the Collateral,
nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document (Third Mezzanine) shall
be construed as requiring Mezzanine Lender to resort to the Collateral for the
satisfaction of any of the Indebtedness, and Mezzanine Lender may seek
satisfaction out of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute
discretion in respect of the Indebtedness. In addition, Mezzanine Lender shall
have the right from time to time to partially foreclose this Agreement and the
Pledge in any manner and for any amounts secured by this Agreement or the Pledge
then due and payable as determined by Mezzanine Lender in its sole discretion
including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event
Mezzanine Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of
one or more scheduled payments of principal or interest, Mezzanine Lender may
foreclose this Agreement and the Pledge to recover such delinquent payments, or
(ii) in the event Mezzanine Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire
outstanding principal balance of the Loan, Mezzanine Lender may foreclose this

as Mezzanine Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by this Agreement
or the Pledge as Mezzanine Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial

            SECTION 17.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS. The rights, powers and
remedies of Mezzanine Lender under this Agreement and the Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy which Mezzanine Lender may have against Mezzanine Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), or existing at law
or in equity or otherwise. Mezzanine Lender's rights, powers and remedies may be
pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Mezzanine Lender may determine in Mezzanine Lender's sole discretion. No delay
or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Mezzanine Borrower or any Guarantor shall not
be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Mezzanine Borrower or any Guarantor or to impair any remedy, right or power
consequent thereon.

            SECTION 17.4 COSTS OF COLLECTION. In the event that after an Event
of Default: (i) the Mezzanine Note or any of the Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or enforcement
or is collected or enforced through any legal proceeding; (ii) an attorney is
retained to represent Mezzanine Lender in any bankruptcy, reorganization,
receivership, or other proceedings affecting creditors' rights and involving a
claim under this Agreement, the Mezzanine Note or any of the Loan Documents
(Third Mezzanine); or (iii) an attorney is retained to protect or enforce the
lien or any of the terms of this Agreement, the Pledge or any of the Loan
Documents (Third Mezzanine); then Mezzanine Borrower shall pay to Mezzanine
Lender all reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses

                                      102

actually incurred in connection therewith, including costs of appeal, together
with interest on any judgment obtained by Mezzanine Lender at the Default Rate.

            SECTION 17.5 DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that,
following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, any
monies are received in connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan
Documents (Third Mezzanine), or otherwise with respect to the realization upon
any of the Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for application as
follows:

            (a) First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
reimbursement of, Mezzanine Lender for or in respect of all reasonable costs,
expenses, disbursements and losses which shall have been incurred or sustained
by Mezzanine Lender to protect or preserve the Collateral or in connection with
the collection of such monies by Mezzanine Lender (including without limitation,
enforcement costs), for the exercise, protection or enforcement by Mezzanine
Lender of all or any of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of Mezzanine
Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine)
or in respect of the Collateral or in support of any provision of adequate
indemnity to Mezzanine Lender against any taxes or liens which by law shall
have, or may have, priority over the rights of Mezzanine Lender to such monies;

            (b) Second, to all other Obligations (Third Mezzanine) in such order
or preference as Mezzanine Lender shall determine in its sole and absolute
discretion;

            (c) Third, the excess, if any, shall be deposited (i) to the Fourth
Mezzanine Account for application under the Fourth Mezzanine Loan Documents, or
(ii) after repayment of the Fourth Mezzanine Loan, provided that Fifth Mezzanine
Lender has funded the Fifth Mezzanine Loan on or before the Outside Date, to the
Fifth Mezzanine Account for application under the Fifth Mezzanine Loan
Documents, or (iii) after repayment of the Fourth Mezzanine Loan and the Fifth
Mezzanine Loan, to the Mezzanine Borrower or to such other Persons as are
entitled thereto.

Mezzanine Borrower shall protect, indemnify and save harmless Mezzanine Lender,
and all officers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, employees, agents,
successors and assigns thereof (collectively, the INDEMNIFIED PARTIES) from and
against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of
action, costs and expenses (including all reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses actually incurred) imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against the
Indemnified Parties, the Collateral or the Property or any part of its interest
therein, by reason of the occurrence or existence of any of the following (to
the extent Proceeds payable on account of the following shall be inadequate; it
being understood that in no event will the Indemnified Parties be required to
actually pay or incur any costs or expenses as a condition to the effectiveness
of the foregoing indemnity) prior to (i) the acceptance by Mezzanine Lender or
its designee of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Collateral, or
(ii) an Indemnified Party or its designee taking possession or control of the
Collateral or (iii) the foreclosure of the Pledge, except to the extent caused
by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Indemnified Parties (other
than such willful misconduct or gross negligence imputed to the Indemnified
Parties because of their interest in the Property): (1) ownership of Mezzanine
Borrower's interest in the Property, or any interest therein, or receipt of any
Rents or other sum therefrom, (2) any accident, injury to or death of any
persons or loss of or damage to Property occurring on or about the Property or
any Appurtenances (as defined in the Security Instrument) thereto, (3) any
design, construction, operation, repair, maintenance, use, non-use or condition
of the Property or Appurtenances thereto, including claims or penalties arising
from violation of any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement, as well as any
claim based on any patent or latent defect, whether or not discoverable by
Mezzanine Lender, any claim the insurance as to which is inadequate, and any
Environmental Claim, (4) any Default under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) or any failure on the part of Mezzanine
Borrower to perform or comply or to cause Mortgage Borrower to perform or comply
with any of the terms of any Lease within the applicable notice or grace
periods, (5) any performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other Property in respect of the Property or any part thereof, (6)
any negligence or tortuous act or omission on the part of Mezzanine Borrower or
any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees, sublessees, licensees or
invitees, (7) any contest referred to in Section 7.3 of the Loan Agreement
(Mortgage), (8) any obligation or undertaking relating to the performance or
discharge of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of the landlord
contained in the Leases, or (9) except as may be expressly limited herein, the
presence at, in or under the Property or the Improvements of any Hazardous
Materials in violation of any Environmental Law. Any amounts the Indemnified
Parties are legally entitled to receive under this Section which are not paid
within fifteen (15) Business Days after written demand therefor by the
Indemnified Parties or Mezzanine Lender, setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount of such demand and the basis therefor, shall bear interest from the date
of demand at the Default Rate, and shall, together with such interest, be part
of the Indebtedness and secured by this Agreement and the Pledge. In case any
action, suit or proceeding is brought against the Indemnified Parties by reason
of any such occurrence, Mezzanine Borrower shall at Mezzanine Borrower's expense
resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding or will cause the same to be
resisted and defended by counsel at Mezzanine Borrower's reasonable expense for
the insurer of the liability or by counsel designated by Mezzanine Borrower
(unless reasonably disapproved by

                                      112
<PAGE>

Mezzanine Lender promptly after Mezzanine Lender has been notified of such
counsel); provided, however, that nothing herein shall compromise the right of
Mezzanine Lender (or any Indemnified Party) to appoint its own counsel at
Mezzanine Borrower's expense for its defense with respect to any action which in
its reasonable opinion presents a conflict or potential conflict between
Mezzanine Lender and Mezzanine Borrower that would make such separate
representation advisable; provided further that if Mezzanine Lender shall have
appointed separate counsel pursuant to the foregoing, Mezzanine Borrower shall
not be responsible for the expense of additional separate counsel of any
Indemnified Party unless in the reasonable opinion of Mezzanine Lender a
conflict or potential conflict exists between such Indemnified Party and
Mezzanine Lender. So long as Mezzanine Borrower is resisting and defending such
action, suit or proceeding as provided above in a prudent and commercially
reasonable manner, Mezzanine Lender and the Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to settle such action, suit or proceeding without Mezzanine Borrower's
consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and claim the
benefit of this Section with respect to such action, suit or proceeding and
Mezzanine Lender agrees that it will not settle any such action, suit or
proceeding without the consent of Mezzanine Borrower; provided, however, that if
Mezzanine Borrower is not diligently defending such action, suit or proceeding
in a prudent and commercially reasonable manner as provided above, and Mezzanine
Lender has provided Mezzanine Borrower with thirty (30) days' prior written
notice, or shorter period if mandated by the requirements of applicable law, and
opportunity to correct such determination, Mezzanine Lender may settle such
action, suit or proceeding and claim the benefit of this Section 19.12 with
respect to settlement of such action, suit or proceeding. Any Indemnified Party
will give Mezzanine Borrower prompt notice after such Indemnified Party obtains
actual knowledge of any potential claim by such Indemnified Party for
indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Parties shall not settle or
compromise any action, proceeding or claim as to which it is indemnified
hereunder without notice to Mezzanine Borrower.

            SECTION 19.13 EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES INCORPORATED. The Exhibits and
Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part of this
Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

            SECTION 19.14 OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES. Any assignee of
Mezzanine Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Mezzanine Note and the
other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) shall take the same free and clear of all
offsets, counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents which
Mezzanine Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents,
and no such unrelated counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by
Mezzanine Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon
such documents and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated
offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby
expressly waived by Mezzanine Borrower.

            SECTION 19.15 LIABILITY OF ASSIGNEES OF MEZZANINE LENDER. No
assignee of Mezzanine Lender shall have any personal liability, directly or
indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document (Third Mezzanine) or any amendment or amendments hereto made at any
time or times, heretofore or hereafter, any different than the liability of
Mezzanine Lender hereunder. In addition, no assignee shall have at any time or
times hereafter any personal liability, directly or indirectly, under or in
connection with or secured by

                                      113
<PAGE>

any agreement, lease, instrument, encumbrance, claim or right affecting or
relating to the Property or to which the Property is now or hereafter subject
any different than the liability of Mezzanine Lender hereunder. The limitation
of liability provided in this Section 19.15 is (i) in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any limitation of liability applicable to the assignee provided
by law or by any other contract, agreement or instrument, and (ii) shall not
apply to any assignee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

            SECTION 19.16 NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES.

            (a) Mezzanine Borrower and Mezzanine Lender intend that the
relationships created hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) be solely that of borrower and lender. Nothing herein or therein is
intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint
tenancy relationship between Mezzanine Borrower and Mezzanine Lender nor to
grant Mezzanine Lender any interest in the Collateral other than that of
Mezzanine Lender.

            (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine)
are solely for the benefit of Mezzanine Lender and Mezzanine Borrower and
nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Mezzanine Lender and
Mezzanine Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or
observance of any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions
to the obligations of Mezzanine Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed
solely and exclusively for the benefit of Mezzanine Lender and no other Person
shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance
with their terms or be entitled to assume that Mezzanine Lender will refuse to
make the Loan in the absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no
other Person shall under any circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such
conditions, any or all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by
Mezzanine Lender if, in Mezzanine Lender's sole discretion, Mezzanine Lender
deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

            SECTION 19.17 PUBLICITY. All news releases, publicity or advertising
by Mezzanine Borrower or its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the
general public which refers to the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) or the
financing evidenced by the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), to Mezzanine
Lender, or any of its Affiliates shall be subject to the prior written approval
of Mezzanine Lender.

            SECTION 19.18 WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, Mezzanine Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns,
waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of Mezzanine Borrower,
Mezzanine Borrower's shareholders and others with interests in Mezzanine
Borrower and of the Collateral, and agrees not to assert any right under any
laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of
alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or
any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Mezzanine
Lender under the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) to a sale of the Collateral
for the collection of the Indebtedness without any prior or different resort for
collection or of the right of Mezzanine Lender to the payment of the
Indebtedness out of the net proceeds of the Collateral in preference to every
other claimant whatsoever.

                                      114
<PAGE>

            SECTION 19.19 WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM AND OTHER ACTIONS. Mezzanine
Borrower hereby expressly and unconditionally waives, in connection with any
suit, action or proceeding brought by Mezzanine Lender on this Agreement, the
Mezzanine Note, the Pledge or any Loan Document (Third Mezzanine), any and every
right it may have to (i) interpose any counterclaim therein (other than a
counterclaim which can only be asserted in the suit, action or proceeding
brought by Mezzanine Lender on this Agreement, the Mezzanine Note, the Pledge or
any Loan Document (Third Mezzanine) and cannot be maintained in a separate
action) and (ii) have any such suit, action or proceeding consolidated with any
other or separate suit, action or proceeding.

            SECTION 19.20 CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE. In the
event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the
other Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine), the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents (Third Mezzanine) and that such Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) shall
not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party
which drafted same. Mezzanine Borrower acknowledges that, with respect to the
Loan, Mezzanine Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in
entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any statements,
representations or recommendations of Mezzanine Lender or any parent, subsidiary
or Affiliate of Mezzanine Lender. Mezzanine Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents (Third Mezzanine) or any other agreements or
instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Mezzanine Lender of any equity interest any
of them may acquire in Mezzanine Borrower, and Mezzanine Borrower hereby
irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on the
basis of the foregoing with respect to Mezzanine Lender's exercise of any such
rights or remedies. Mezzanine Borrower acknowledges that Mezzanine Lender
engages in the business of real estate financings and other real estate
transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive
with the business of Mezzanine Borrower or its Affiliates.

            SECTION 19.21 PRIOR AGREEMENTS. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (Third Mezzanine) contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto
and thereto in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
all prior agreements among or between such parties, whether oral or written, are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (Third
Mezzanine) and unless specifically set forth in a writing contemporaneous
herewith the terms, conditions and provisions of any and all such prior
agreements do not survive execution of this Agreement.

            SECTION 19.22 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which shall constitute one document.

            SECTION 19.23 DISCLOSURE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Sections 15.1 and 15.6, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by such Sections, in no event shall Mezzanine Lender deliver
financial information with respect to the Collateral, the Property or the
Guarantor to the Persons listed in SCHEDULE III, without first obtaining

                                      115

Mezzanine Borrower's prior written consent; provided however, Mezzanine
Borrower's consent shall not be required with respect to Morgan Stanley, Lehman
Brothers, The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association and the state of Ohio Pension Fund if
Mezzanine Lender delivers a confidentiality agreement from any of such Persons
reasonably acceptable to Mezzanine Borrower.

                                      116
