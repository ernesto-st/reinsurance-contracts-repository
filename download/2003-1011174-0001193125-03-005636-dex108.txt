                        MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT

       THIS MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT is made as of the 2nd day of May,
2003 by and among (i) BRE-FMCF, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(together with any Additional Borrowers, individually and collectively,
"Borrower"), and (ii) PRUDENTIAL MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Lender").

                                    RECITALS

       A.     Borrower owns one or more Multifamily Residential Properties
(unless otherwise defined or the context clearly indicates otherwise,
capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Appendix I
of this Agreement) as more particularly described in Exhibit A to this
Agreement.

       B.     Borrower has requested that Lender establish a $100,000,000 Credit
Facility in favor of Borrower, comprised initially of a $100,000,000 Variable
Facility, all or part of which can be converted to a Fixed Facility in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

       C.     To secure the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents issued in connection with the Credit Facility, Borrower
shall create a Collateral Pool in favor of Lender. The Collateral Pool shall be
comprised of (i) the Multifamily Residential Properties listed on Exhibit A and
(ii) any other collateral pledged to Lender from time to time by Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents.

       D.     Each Note and Security Document related to the Mortgaged
Properties comprising the Collateral Pool shall be cross-defaulted (i.e., a
default under any Note, Security Document relating to the Collateral Pool and
under this Agreement, shall constitute a default under each Note, Security
Document and this Agreement related to the Mortgaged Properties comprising the
Collateral Pool) and cross-collateralized (i.e., each Security Instrument
related to the Mortgaged Properties within the Collateral Pool shall secure all
of Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) and
it is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that Lender may accelerate any
Note without needing to accelerate any other Note and that in the exercise of
its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, Lender may, except as provided
in this Agreement, exercise and perfect any and all of its rights in and under
the Loan Documents with regard to any Mortgaged Property without needing to
exercise and perfect its rights and remedies with respect to any other Mortgaged
Property and that any such exercise shall be without regard to the Allocable
Facility Amount assigned to such Mortgaged Property and that Lender may recover
an amount equal to the full amount outstanding in respect of any of the Notes in
connection with such exercise and any such amount shall be applied as determined
by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion.

       E.     Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement, Lender has agreed to establish the Credit Facility.

<PAGE>

       NOW, THEREFORE, Borrower and Lender, in consideration of the mutual
promises and agreements contained in this Agreement, hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                 THE COMMITMENT

       SECTION 1.01.       The Commitment.

       Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement:

              (a)    Variable Facility Commitment. Lender agrees to make
Variable Advances to Borrower from time to time during the Variable Facility
Availability Period. The aggregate principal balance of the Variable Advances
Outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Variable Facility Commitment.
Borrower may re-borrow any part of the Variable Advances which it has previously
borrowed and repaid. Except as provided in Section 2.04(c) of this Agreement, no
Variable Advances shall be made as a result of increases in the Valuation of any
Mortgaged Property. Any portion of the Variable Facility Commitment not
available to be advanced due to the inability of Borrower to satisfy the
requirements for the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and the Aggregate Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for a period of two (2) years shall be deemed terminated
and the partial termination provisions (including payment of the Facility
Termination Fee) set forth in Article 5 and Article 6 shall apply to such
partial termination.

              (b)    Fixed Facility Commitment. Lender agrees to make Fixed
Advances to Borrower from time to time during the Fixed Facility Availability
Period. The aggregate original principal of the Fixed Advances shall not exceed
the Fixed Facility Commitment. The borrowing of a Fixed Advance shall
permanently reduce the Fixed Facility Commitment by the original principal
amount of such Fixed Advance. Borrower may not re-borrow any part of the Fixed
Advance which it has previously borrowed and repaid. Except as provided in
Section 2.04(c) of this Agreement, no Fixed Advances shall be made as a result
of increases in the Valuation of any Mortgaged Property. Any portion of the
Fixed Facility Commitment not available to be advanced due to the inability of
Borrower to satisfy the requirements for the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and
the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio for a period of two (2) years shall be
deemed terminated and the partial termination provisions (including payment of
the Facility Termination Fee) set forth in Article 5 and Article 6 shall apply
to such partial termination.

       SECTION 1.02.       Requests for Advances.

       Borrower shall request an Advance by giving Lender an Advance Request in
accordance with Section 2.04. The Advance Request shall indicate whether the
Request is for a Fixed Advance, a Variable Advance or both.

       SECTION 1.03.       Maturity Date of Advances.

                                        2

<PAGE>

              (a)    Variable Advances. The MBS Issue Date shall be the first
day of a month and the maturity date of the MBS funding each Variable Advance
shall be specified by Borrower in its Advance Request, which date shall be:

                     (i)    no earlier than the date which completes one full
month after the MBS Issue Date; and

                     (ii)   no later than the date which completes nine full
months after the MBS Issue Date.

       For these purposes, a year shall be deemed to consist of 12 30-day
months. For example, the date which completes three full months after September
1 shall be December 1; and the date which completes three full months after
January 1 shall be April 1.

              (b)    Fixed Advances; Amortization Period. The maturity date of
each Fixed Advance shall be the 10th anniversary of the Initial Closing Date.
The principal of each Fixed Advance shall be amortized on a 30-year schedule.

              (c)    Prepayment. Fixed Advances are not prepayable at any time,
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower (i) may prepay not less
than all of any Fixed Advance during the last ninety (90) days of the term of
such Fixed Advance, and (ii) may, if defeasance is elected pursuant to Section
1.11, defease not less than all of any Fixed Advance pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Section 1.11, or, if yield maintenance is selected pursuant to
Section 1.11, may prepay not less than all of any Fixed Advance pursuant to the
yield maintenance provisions of the Fixed Facility Note.

       SECTION 1.04.       Interest on Advances.

              (a)    Partial Month Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section, if an Advance is not made on the first day of a
calendar month, and the MBS Issue Date is the first day of the month following
the month in which the Advance is made, Borrower shall pay interest on the
original stated principal amount of the Advance for the partial month period
commencing on the Closing Date for the Advance and ending on the last day of the
calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs, (i) for a Variable Advance at a
rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) the Coupon Rate as determined in
accordance with Section 1.05(a) and (2) a rate determined by Lender, based on
Lender's cost of funds and approved in advance, in writing, by Borrower,
pursuant to the procedures mutually agreed upon by Borrower and Lender, and (ii)
for a Fixed Advance at a rate, per annum equal to the greater of (1) the
interest rate described in subsection (c)(i) of this Section and (2) a rate
determined by Lender, based on Lender's cost of funds, and approved in advance,
in writing, by Borrower, pursuant to procedures mutually agreed upon by Borrower
and Lender.

              (b)    Variable Advances.

                     (i)    Discount. Each Variable Advance shall be a discount
loan. The original stated principal amount of a Variable Advance shall be the
sum of the Price and the Discount. The Price and Discount of each Variable
Advance shall be determined in accordance

                                        3

<PAGE>

with the procedures set out in Section 2.01. The proceeds of any Variable
Advance made available by Lender to Borrower will equal the Price. Borrower
shall pay to Lender, in advance of each Rollover Variable Advance, the entire
Discount for such Rollover Variable Advance. The Discount for the initial
advance of each Variable Advance which is not a Rollover Variable Advance is
reflected in the original stated principal amount of such Variable Advance and
shall be paid by Borrower upon repayment of such Variable Advance.

                     (ii)   Variable Facility Fee. In addition to paying the
Discount and the partial month interest, if any, Borrower shall pay monthly
installments of the Variable Facility Fee to Lender for each Variable Advance
from the applicable MBS Issue Date to its maturity date. The Variable Facility
Fee shall be payable in advance, in accordance with the terms of the Variable
Facility Note. The first installment shall be payable on or prior to the Closing
Date for the Variable Advance and shall apply to the first full calendar month
of such MBS. Subsequent installments shall be payable on the first day of each
calendar month, commencing on the first day of the second full calendar month of
such MBS, to its maturity date. Each installment of the Variable Facility Fee
shall be in an amount equal to the product of (1) the Variable Facility Fee, (2)
the original stated principal amount of the Variable Advance, and (3) 1/12.

              (c)    Fixed Advances.

                     (i)    Annual Interest Rate. Each Fixed Advance shall bear
interest at a rate, per annum, equal to the sum of (1) the MBS Pass-Through Rate
for such Fixed Advance and (2) the Fixed Facility Fee.

                     (ii)   Fixed Facility Fee. In addition to paying the
partial month interest, if any, Borrower shall pay monthly installments of the
MBS Pass-Through Rate and the Fixed Facility Fee to Lender for each Fixed
Advance from the applicable MBS Issue Date to its maturity date. The MBS
Pass-Through Rate and the Fixed Facility Fee shall be payable in arrears, in
accordance with the terms of the Fixed Facility Note. The first installment
shall be payable on the first day of each calendar month, commencing on the
first day of the second full calendar month of such MBS, to its maturity date.
Each installment of the Fixed Facility Fee shall be in an amount equal to the
product of (1) the Fixed Facility Fee, (2) the amount of the Fixed Advance, and
(3) 1/12.

       SECTION 1.05.       Coupon Rates for Advances.

              (a)    Variable Advances. The Coupon Rate shall equal the sum of
(1) an interest rate as determined by Lender (rounded to three places) payable
for the MBS pursuant to the MBS Commitment ("MBS Imputed Interest Rate") and (2)
the Variable Facility Fee.

              (b)    Fixed Advances. The Coupon Rate shall be the rate of
interest applicable to such Fixed Advance pursuant to Section 1.04(c)(i).

       SECTION 1.06.       Notes.

              (a)    Variable Advances. The obligation of Borrower to repay the
Variable Advances shall be evidenced by the Variable Facility Note. The Variable
Facility Note shall be

                                        4

<PAGE>

payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the amount of the Variable
Facility Commitment.

              (b)    Fixed Advances. The obligation of Borrower to repay the
Fixed Advances shall be evidenced by the Fixed Facility Notes. The Fixed
Facility Notes shall be payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the
original principal amount of each Fixed Advance.

       SECTION 1.07.       Extension of Variable Facility Termination Date.

       Borrower shall have the right to extend the Variable Facility Termination
Date for one (1) five (5) year period ("Extension") upon satisfaction of each of
the following conditions:

              (a)    Borrower provides written notice requesting the Extension
("Extension Notice") to Lender not less than thirty (30) nor more than ninety
(90) days prior to the then effective Variable Facility Termination Date.

              (b)    No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default exists on
either the date the Extension Notice is given or on the then effective Variable
Facility Termination Date.

              (c)    All of the representations and warranties of Borrower
contained in Exhibit T to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (other
than those which speak only as to an earlier date) are true and correct in all
material respects on the date the Extension Notice is given and on the then
effective Variable Facility Termination Date.

              (d)    Borrower is in compliance with all of the covenants
contained in Articles 8 and 9 on the date the Extension Notice is given and on
the then effective Variable Facility Termination Date.

       Upon receipt of the Extension Notice and upon compliance with conditions
set forth above, the Variable Facility Termination Date shall be extended for
one (1) five (5) year period on the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, provided that the Fees applicable to the
Variable Facility during the Extension shall be as determined by Lender prior to
the Extension, provided that if Borrower does not wish to accept the Fees
determined by Lender for the Extension, Borrower may, prior to the then
effective Variable Facility Termination Date, withdraw (which withdrawal shall
be by written notice to Lender) the Extension Notice and repay all Variable
Amounts Outstanding and all other amounts then due under the Loan Documents not
later than the Variable Facility Termination Date.

       SECTION 1.08.       Conversion from Variable Facility Commitment to Fixed
Facility Commitment.

       Except as provided in Section 1.09, in connection with a Fixed Advance
only, Borrower shall have the right, from time to time during the Fixed Facility
Availability Period, to convert all or any portion of the Variable Facility
Commitment to the Fixed Facility Commitment. The Variable Facility Commitment
shall be reduced by, and the Fixed Facility Commitment shall be increased by,
the amount of each conversion.

<PAGE>

              (a)    Request. To convert all or a portion of the Variable
Facility Commitment to the Fixed Facility Commitment, Borrower shall deliver a
Conversion Request to Lender. Each Conversion Request shall designate (1) the
amount of the conversion and (2) any Variable Advances Outstanding which will be
prepaid on or before the Closing Date for the conversion as required by Section
1.09(c).

              (b)    Closing. Subject to Section 1.09 and provided that all
conditions contained in Section 1.10 are satisfied, Lender shall permit the
requested conversion to close at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date
selected by Lender, and occurring within 30 Business Days after Lender's receipt
of the Conversion Request (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may
agree). At the closing, Lender and Borrower shall execute and deliver, at the
sole cost and expense of Borrower, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender,
the Conversion Documents.

       SECTION 1.09.       Limitations on Right to Convert.

       Borrower's right to convert all or any portion of the Variable Facility
Commitment to the Fixed Facility Commitment is subject to the following
limitations:

              (a)    Closing Date. The Closing Date shall occur during the Fixed
Facility Availability Period.

              (b)    Minimum Request. Each Conversion Request shall be in the
minimum amount of $10,000,000.

              (c)    Obligation to Prepay Variable Advances. Borrower shall
prepay any difference by which, after the conversion, the aggregate unpaid
principal balance of all Variable Advances Outstanding will exceed the Variable
Facility Commitment.

       SECTION 1.10.       Conditions to Conversion.

       The conversion of all or any portion of the Variable Facility Commitment
to the Fixed Facility Commitment is subject to the satisfaction, on or before
the Closing Date, of (a) the conditions precedent contained in Section 6.08 and
(b) all applicable General Conditions contained in Section 6.01.

       SECTION 1.11.       Defeasance; Yield Maintenance.

       At such time as Borrower requests the first Fixed Advance, or, if prior
in time, elects to convert all or a portion of the Variable Facility Commitment
to a Fixed Facility Commitment, Borrower shall select defeasance or yield
maintenance with respect to all prepayments of Fixed Advances. Borrower shall
notify Lender of such selection on the Advance Request for the first Fixed
Advance or on the first Conversion Request, as applicable. The terms and
conditions of defeasance and yield maintenance are contained in the Fixed
Facility Note. If the Borrower elects defeasance and any Fixed Facility Note is
defeased pursuant to the terms thereof, such defeasance shall satisfy Borrower's
obligations with respect to such Fixed Facility Note. The selection of Borrower
as to defeasance or yield maintenance made at the time of the first

                                        6

<PAGE>

Advance Request for a Fixed Advance or the first Conversion Request shall apply
to the prepayment of all Fixed Advances during the term of this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 2

                                  THE ADVANCES

       SECTION 2.01.       Rate Setting for an Advance.

       Rates for an Advance shall be set in accordance with the following
procedures:

              (a)    Preliminary, Nonbinding Quote. At Borrower's request Lender
shall quote an estimate of the MBS Pass-Through Rate (for a proposed Fixed
Advance) or MBS Imputed Interest Rate (for a proposed Variable Advance).
Lender's quote shall be based on (1) a solicitation of bids from institutional
investors selected by Lender and (2) the proposed terms and amount of the
Advance selected by Borrower. The quote shall not be binding upon Lender.

              (b)    Rate Setting. If Borrower satisfies all of the conditions
to Lender's obligation to make the Advance to be satisfied prior to the setting
of the MBS Pass-Through Rate, then Borrower may submit to Lender, by facsimile
transmission before 1:00 p.m. Washington, D.C. time on any Business Day ("Rate
Setting Date"), a completed and executed Rate Form. The Rate Form shall specify
the amount, term, MBS Issue Date, Facility Fee, any breakage fee deposit amount,
the proposed maximum Coupon Rate ("Maximum Annual Coupon Rate") and Closing Date
for the Advance.

              (c)    Rate Confirmation. Within one Business Day after receipt of
the Rate Form, Lender shall solicit bids from institutional investors selected
by Lender based on the information in the Rate Form and, provided the actual
Coupon Rate would be at or below the Maximum Annual Coupon Rate, shall obtain a
commitment ("MBS Commitment") for the purchase of an MBS having the bid terms
described in the related Rate Form. Lender shall then complete and countersign
the Rate Form thereby confirming the amount, term, MBS Issue Date, MBS Delivery
Date, MBS Imputed Interest Rate or MBS Pass-Through Rate, Facility Fee, Coupon
Rate, Discount, Price, and Closing Date for the Advance and shall immediately
deliver by facsimile transmission the Rate Form to Borrower.

       SECTION 2.02.       Advance Confirmation Instrument for Variable
Advances.

       On or before the Closing Date for a Variable Advance, Borrower shall
execute and deliver to Lender a fully executed Advance Confirmation Instrument,
confirming the amount, term, MBS Issue Date, MBS Delivery Date, MBS Imputed
Interest Rate, Variable Facility Fee, Coupon Rate, Discount, Price and Closing
Date for the Advance, and Borrower's obligation to repay the Variable Advance in
accordance with the terms of the Variable Facility Note and this Agreement. Upon
the funding of the Variable Advance, Lender shall insert the date of funding on
the Advance Confirmation Instrument and deliver a copy of the completed Advance
Confirmation Instrument to Borrower to evidence the date of funding and to
confirm that the Advance Confirmation Instrument is not effective until the date
of funding. Lender's failure to do so shall not invalidate the Advance
Confirmation Instrument or otherwise affect in any way

                                        7

<PAGE>

any obligation of Borrower to repay Variable Advances in accordance with the
Advance Confirmation Instrument, the Variable Facility Note or the other Loan
Documents.

       SECTION 2.03.       Breakage and other Costs.

         If Lender obtains, and then fails to fulfill, the MBS Commitment
because the Advance is not made (for a reason other than Lender's default),
Borrower shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs payable to the potential
investor and other reasonable costs, fees and damages incurred by Lender in
connection with its failure to fulfill the MBS Commitment. Lender reserves the
right to require Borrower to post a deposit at the time the MBS Commitment is
obtained, provided that no such deposit shall be required in connection with a
Rollover Variable Advance. Such deposit shall be refundable to Borrower upon the
delivery of the related MBS.

       SECTION 2.04.       Advances.

       Borrower may deliver an Advance Request to Lender.

              (a)    If the Advance Request is to obtain the Initial Advance and
all conditions precedent contained in Section 6.02 and the General Conditions
contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied on or before the Closing Date for the
Initial Advance, Lender shall make the Initial Advance on the Initial Closing
Date or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree.

              (b)    If the Advance Request is to obtain a Future Advance, such
Advance Request shall be in the minimum amount of $3,000,000. If all conditions
precedent contained in Section 6.03 and the General Conditions contained in
Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender shall make the requested Future Advance, at a
closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date selected by
Lender, which date shall be not more than three (3) Business Days after
Borrower's receipt from Lender of the confirmed Rate Form (or on such other date
as Borrower and Lender may agree).

              (c)    At any time prior to the date two (2) years before the
Variable Facility Termination Date, Borrower shall be entitled to Advances based
on decreases in the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and increases in the Aggregate
Debt Service Coverage Ratio as determined by Lender. The amount of such
additional Advance shall be equal to the amount which, when combined with
Advances already outstanding, equals the maximum amount of Advances that could
be outstanding and the Coverage and LTV Tests satisfied. No such Additional
Advance shall be permitted if the Recourse Termination Date has occurred or if
there are Outstanding Advances in the full amount of the Variable Facility
Commitment and the Fixed Facility Commitment.

       SECTION 2.05.       Determination of Allocable Facility Amount and
Valuations.

              (a)    Initial Determinations. On the Initial Closing Date, Lender
shall determine (i) the Allocable Facility Amount and Valuation for each
Mortgaged Property, (ii) the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the
Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and (iii) the maximum Initial Advance Amount
available to Borrower. The aggregate of the Allocable Facility Amounts shall, at
all times, equal the aggregate of Advances Outstanding. The

                                        8

<PAGE>

determinations made as of the Initial Closing Date shall remain unchanged until
the First Anniversary, provided that Allocable Facility Amounts shall be
adjusted prior to the First Anniversary to reflect increases or decreases in
Advances Outstanding (which adjustments shall only be made to reflect changes in
Advances Outstanding and not changes in Valuations). Changes in Allocable
Facility Amount, Valuations, the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the
Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio shall be made pursuant to Section 2.05(b).

              (b)    Monitoring Determinations. Once each Calendar Quarter or,
if the Commitment consists only of a Fixed Facility Commitment, once each
Calendar Year, within 20 Business Days after Borrower has delivered to Lender
the reports required in Section 8.03, Lender shall determine the Aggregate Debt
Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and whether
Borrower is in compliance with the other covenants set forth in the Loan
Documents. After the First Anniversary, on an annual basis, and if Lender
reasonably decides that changed market or property conditions warrant, Lender
shall determine Allocable Facility Amounts and Valuations. Lender shall also
redetermine Allocable Facility Amounts to take account of any addition or
release of Collateral or other event which invalidates the outstanding
determinations. In determining Valuations, Lender shall use Cap Rates based on
its internal survey and analysis of cap rates for comparable sales in the
vicinity of the Mortgaged Property, with such adjustments as Lender deems
appropriate and without any obligation to use any information provided by
Borrower. If Lender is unable to determine a Cap Rate for a Mortgaged Property,
Lender shall have the right, not more than once annually, to obtain a market
study in order to establish a Cap Rate. Lender shall promptly disclose its
determinations to Borrower. Until redetermined, the outstanding Allocable
Facility Amounts and Valuations shall remain in effect. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, no change in Allocable Facility Amounts,
Valuations, the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio or the Aggregate Debt Service
Coverage Ratio shall, unless resulting from the removal of Collateral from the
Collateral Pool, (i) result in a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default
or (ii) preclude the making of a Rollover Variable Advance.

                                    ARTICLE 3

                               COLLATERAL CHANGES

       SECTION 3.01.       Right to Add Collateral.

       Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article, Borrower shall have
the right, from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, to add
Multifamily Residential Properties to the Collateral Pools.

       SECTION 3.02.       Procedure for Adding Collateral.

       The procedure for adding Collateral contained in this Section 3.02 shall
apply to all additions of Collateral.

              (a)    Request. Borrower may deliver to Lender an Addition Request
to add one or more Multifamily Residential Properties to a Collateral Pool. Each
Addition Request shall be accompanied by the following: (i) the information
required by the DUS Guide Underwriting

                                        9

<PAGE>

Requirements and any additional information Lender may reasonably request; and
(ii) the payment of all Additional Collateral Due Diligence Fees.

              (b)    Underwriting. Prior to the First Anniversary, Borrower may
add any Additional Mortgaged Property provided that, after such addition, the
Coverage and LTV Tests are satisfied. Thereafter, the proposed Additional
Mortgaged Property must itself have a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of not less
than 1.35 to 1.0 and a Loan to Value Ratio of not more than 65% and, after such
addition, the Coverage and LTV Tests must be satisfied. Lender shall evaluate
the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property in accordance with the DUS Guide
Underwriting Requirements, including then applicable underwriting interest rate
floors, and shall make underwriting determinations as to the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio and the Loan to Value Ratio of the proposed Additional Mortgaged
Property and the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to
Value Ratio applicable to the Collateral Pool on the basis of the lesser of (1)
the acquisition price of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property if purchased
by Borrower within 12 months of the related Addition Request, and (2) a
Valuation made with respect to the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property.
Within 30 Business Days after receipt of (1) the Addition Request and (2) all
reports, certificates and documents required by the DUS Guide Underwriting
Requirements, including a zoning analysis undertaken in accordance with Section
206 of Part III of the DUS Guide, Lender shall notify Borrower whether it shall
consent to the Addition Request. If Lender consents it shall set forth the
Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio
which it estimates shall result from the addition of the proposed Additional
Mortgaged Property. Within five Business Days after receipt of Lender's consent
to the Addition Request, Borrower shall notify Lender whether it elects to add
the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to a Collateral Pool. If Borrower
fails to respond within the period of five Business Days, it shall be
conclusively deemed to have elected not to add the proposed Additional Mortgaged
Property to a Collateral Pool.

              (c)    Closing. If Lender consents to the Addition Request,
Borrower timely elects to add the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to a
Collateral Pool and all conditions precedent contained in Section 6.04 and all
General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender shall permit
the addition of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to a Collateral Pool,
at a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date
selected by Lender, occurring within 30 Business Days after Lender's receipt of
Borrower's election (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree).

       SECTION 3.03.       Right to Obtain Releases of Collateral.

       Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article, Borrower shall have
the right to obtain a release of Collateral from the Collateral Pool.

       SECTION 3.04.       Procedure for Obtaining Releases of Collateral.

              (a)    Request. To obtain a release of Collateral from the
Collateral Pool, Borrower may deliver a Release Request to Lender. The Release
Request shall not result in a termination of all or any part of the Credit
Facility. Borrower may terminate all or any part of the Credit Facility only by
delivering a Facility Termination Request or Credit Facility Termination Request
pursuant to Article 5.

                                       10

<PAGE>

              (b)    Closing. If all conditions precedent contained in Section
6.05 and all General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender
shall cause the Release Property to be released, at a closing to be held at
offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date selected by Lender, and occurring
within 30 days after Lender's receipt of the Release Request (or on such other
date as Borrower and Lender may agree), by executing and delivering, and causing
all applicable parties to execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and expense
of Borrower, the Release Documents. Borrower shall prepare the Release Documents
and submit them to Lender for its review.

              (c)    Release Price. The "Release Price" for each Mortgaged
Property means (A) if the Recourse Termination Date has not occurred, the
amount, if any, of Advances Outstanding which are required to be repaid by the
Borrower to the Lender in connection with the proposed release of the Mortgaged
Property from the Collateral Pool so that, immediately after the release, the
Coverage and LTV Tests will be satisfied, and (B) if the Recourse Termination
Date has occurred, the greater of (i) the Allocable Facility Amount for the
Mortgaged Property to be released and (ii) the amount, if any, of Advances
Outstanding which are required to be repaid by the Borrower to the Lender in
connection with the proposed release of the Mortgaged Property from the
Collateral Pool so that, immediately after the release, the Coverage and LTV
Tests will be satisfied. In addition to the Release Price, the Borrower shall
pay to the Lender the Release Fee and all associated prepayment premiums and
other amounts due under the Notes and any Advance Confirmation Instruments
evidencing the Advances being repaid.

              (d)    Application of Release Price. The portion of the Release
Price equal to 100% of the Allocable Facility Amount for the Release Property
shall be applied first against the Variable Advances Outstanding until there are
no further Variable Advances Outstanding, then against the prepayment of Fixed
Advances Outstanding, so long as the prepayment is permitted under the
applicable Fixed Facility Note. The remainder of the Release Price shall be held
by Lender (or its appointed collateral agent) as substitute Collateral
("Substitute Cash Collateral"), in accordance with a security agreement and
other documents in form and substance acceptable to Lender. Substitute Cash
Collateral remaining will be returned to the Borrower on (A) if the Recourse
Termination Date has not occurred, in whole or in part, from time to time, upon
written request of the Borrower, provided that, immediately after such return,
the Coverage and LTV Tests will be satisfied (calculated using the definition of
"Facility Debt Service" set forth in paragraph (b) of such definition), and (B)
if the Recourse Termination Date has occurred, the Termination Date. If, on the
date Borrower pays the Release Price, Variable Advances are Outstanding but not
then due and payable, Lender shall hold the Release Price as additional
Collateral, until the next date on which Variable Advances are due and payable,
at which time Lender shall apply the appropriate portion of the Release Price to
such Variable Advances.

              (e)    Title Insurance. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Section 3.04, no release of any of the Mortgaged Properties shall be made
unless the Borrower has provided title insurance, taking into account tie-in
endorsements, to Lender in respect of each of the remaining Mortgaged Properties
in the Collateral Pool in an amount equal to 125% of the Initial Valuation of
each of such remaining Mortgaged Properties.

                                       11

<PAGE>

       SECTION 3.05.       Right to Substitute Collateral.

       Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of Section 3.02 and
Section 3.04, Borrower shall have the right to add a Multifamily Residential
Property to the Collateral Pool simultaneously with the release of a Release
Property thereby effecting a substitution. In connection with a substitution,
Borrower shall pay all Substitution Fees and Release Fees, but shall not be
required to pay any Addition Fees or, to the extent of the Allocable Facility
Amount of the Mortgaged Property added to the Collateral Pool, any Release
Price.

                          EXPANSION OF CREDIT FACILITY

       SECTION 4.01.       Right to Increase Commitment.

       Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this Article,
Borrower shall have the right, during the Fixed Facility Availability Period, to
increase the Variable Facility Commitment (provided that no increase in the
Variable Facility Commitment shall occur after the Recourse Termination Date),
the Fixed Facility Commitment or both. Borrower's right to increase the
Commitment is subject to the following limitations:

              (a)    Maximum Amount of Increase in Commitment. The maximum
amount by which the Commitment may be increased is $150,000,000, for a maximum
total Commitment of $250,000,000.

              (b)    Minimum Request. Each Request for an increase in the
Commitment shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000.

              (c)    Terms and Conditions. Except with respect to any increase
in the Commitment made from the Reserved Amount, the terms and conditions of
this Agreement shall apply to any increase in the Commitment closed prior to the
First Anniversary. With respect to any increases in the Commitment made from the
Reserved Amount, regardless of when the increase occurs, the pricing of Advances
from such increase shall be the pricing for Advances set forth in this Agreement
on the date hereof and all other terms and conditions applicable to any increase
in the Commitment shall be mutually agreed upon by Lender and Borrower.
Thereafter, the terms and conditions (including pricing) applicable to any
increase in the Commitment shall be mutually agreed upon by Lender and Borrower.

       SECTION 4.02.       Procedure for Obtaining Increases in Commitment.

              (a)    Request. To obtain an increase in the Commitment, Borrower
       shall deliver an Expansion Request to Lender. Each Expansion Request
       shall include the following:

                     (i)    The total amount of the proposed increase;

                     (ii)   A designation of the increase as being part of the
              Variable Facility Commitment or the Fixed Facility Commitment; and

                                       12

<PAGE>

                     (iii)  If applicable, a request that Lender inform Borrower
              of the Variable Facility Fee and/or Fixed Facility Fee which will
              apply to Advances drawn from such increase in the Commitment.

       SECTION 4.03.       Closing.

       If all conditions precedent contained in Section 6.07 of this Agreement
and all applicable General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 of this
Agreement are satisfied, Lender shall permit the Expansion Request to occur, at
a closing to be held at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date selected
by Lender, and occurring within fifteen (15) Business Days after Lender's
receipt of the Expansion Request (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender
may agree).

       SECTION 5.01.       Right to Complete or Partial Termination of
Facilities.

       Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article, Borrower shall have
the right to permanently reduce the Variable Facility Commitment and/or the
Fixed Facility Commitment.

       SECTION 5.02.       Procedure for Complete or Partial Termination of
Facilities.

              (a)    Request. To permanently reduce the Variable Facility
Commitment (and, if desired by Borrower, to cause the Recourse Termination Date
to occur) or the Fixed Facility Commitment, Borrower shall deliver a Facility
Termination Request to Lender. A permanent reduction of the Variable Facility
Commitment to $0 shall be referred to as a "Complete Variable Facility
Termination." A permanent reduction of the Fixed Facility Commitment to $0 shall
be referred to as a "Complete Fixed Facility Termination." The Facility
Termination Request shall include the following:

                     (i)    The proposed amount of the reduction in the Variable
Facility Commitment and/or Fixed Facility Commitment; and

                     (ii)   Unless there is a Complete Variable Facility
Termination or a Complete Fixed Facility Termination, a designation by Borrower
of any Variable Advances which will be prepaid and/or any Fixed Advances which
will be prepaid or defeased.

Any release of Collateral, whether or not made in connection with a Facility
Termination Request, must comply with all conditions to a release which are
contained in Article 6.

              (b)    Closing. If all conditions precedent contained in Section
6.09 and all General Conditions contained in Section 6.01 are satisfied, Lender
shall reduce the Variable Facility Commitment or Fixed Facility Commitment, as
the case may be, to the amount designated by Borrower, at a closing to be held
at offices designated by Lender on a Closing Date selected by Lender, within
thirty (30) Business Days after Lender's receipt of the Facility Termination

of the Collateral to be released, at a closing to be held at offices designated
by Lender on a Closing Date selected by Lender, within 30 Business Days after
Lender's receipt of the Credit Facility Termination Request (or on such other
date as Borrower and Lender may agree), by executing and delivering, and causing
all applicable parties to execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and expense
of Borrower, the Credit Facility Termination Documents.

       Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, Borrower shall have
the right to undertake any alteration, improvement, demolition, removal or
construction (collectively, "Alterations") to the Mortgaged Property which it
owns without the prior consent of Lender; provided, however, that in any case,

       SECTION 8.10.       Loan Document Taxes.

a participation holder)) ("Loan Document Taxes") is levied, assessed or charged
by the United States, or any State in the United States, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein upon any of the Loan
Documents or the obligations secured thereby, the interest of Lender in the
Mortgaged Properties, or Lender

                                       27

<PAGE>

by reason of or as holder of the Loan Documents, Borrower shall pay all such
Loan Document Taxes to, for, or on account of Lender (or provide funds to Lender
for such payment, as the case may be) as they become due and payable and shall
promptly furnish proof of such payment to Lender, as applicable. In the event of
passage of any law or regulation permitting, authorizing or requiring such Loan
Document Taxes to be levied, assessed or charged, which law or regulation in the
opinion of counsel to Lender may prohibit Borrower from paying the Loan Document
Taxes to or for Lender, Borrower shall enter into such further instruments as
may be permitted by law to obligate Borrower to pay such Loan Document Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to make any
payment pursuant to this Section 8.10 with respect to (i) any Loan Document
Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the failure by a Lender, any
assignee or participant to provide timely Borrower with an applicable
certification or form (including, without limitation, the appropriate Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8) if providing such certification would have resulted in
an exemption from or reduction in such Loan Document Taxes or (ii) any Loan
Document Taxes that would apply to a payment made to any Lender (other than
Fannie Mae), its assignee or participant on the day such Lender, assignee or
participant becomes a party to this Agreement or otherwise acquires an interest
in any loan made pursuant to this Agreement.

action as Lender from time to time may request as reasonably necessary,
desirable or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or to subject the Collateral to the lien and
security interests of the Loan Documents or to evidence, perfect or otherwise
implement, to assure the lien and security interests intended by the terms of
the Loan Documents or in order to exercise or enforce its rights under the Loan
Documents.

       SECTION 8.12.       Transfer of Ownership Interest of Borrower and
Guarantor.

paragraph (a) of this Section, the following Transfers by Borrower or Guarantor
are permitted without the consent of Lender:

                     (i)    A Transfer that occurs by inheritance, devise, or
bequest or by operation of law upon the death of a natural person who is the
owner of a direct or indirect ownership interest in Borrower or Guarantor .

                     (ii)   A Transfer to trusts or other entities established
for the benefit of the transferor and/or immediate family members for estate
planning purposes.

                                       28

<PAGE>

                     (iii)  A Transfer of limited liability company membership
interest or stock by the members or shareholders of Borrower or Guarantor;
provided, however, that no Change in Control occurs as the result of such
Transfer.

                     (iv)   The issuance by Borrower or Guarantor of additional
membership units or stock and the subsequent Transfer of such units; provided,
however, that no Change in Control occurs as the result of such Transfer.

                     (v)    A merger with or acquisition of another entity by
Borrower or Guarantor, provided that (A) Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may
be, is the surviving entity after such merger or acquisition, (B) no Change in
Control occurs, and (C) such merger or acquisition does not result in an Event
of Default, as such terms are defined in this Agreement.

              (c)    Consent to Prohibited Transfers. Lender may, in its sole
and absolute discretion, consent to a Transfer that would otherwise violate this
Section if, prior to the Transfer, Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may be,
has satisfied each of the following requirements:

                     (i)    the submission to Lender of all information required
by Lender to make the determination required by this Section;

                     (ii)   the absence of any Event of Default;

                     (iii)  the transferee meets all of the eligibility, credit,
management and other standards (including any standards with respect to previous
relationships between Lender and the transferee and the organization of the
transferee) customarily applied by Lender at the time of the proposed Transfer
to the approval of Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may be, in connection with
the origination or purchase of similar mortgages, deeds of trust or deeds to
secure debt on multifamily properties;

                     (iv)   in the case of a Transfer of direct or indirect
ownership interests in Borrower or Guarantor, as the case may be, if transferor
or any other person has obligations under any Loan Documents, the execution by
the transferee of one or more individuals or entities acceptable to Lender of an
assumption agreement that is acceptable to Lender and that, among other things,
requires the transferee to perform all obligations of transferor or such person
set forth in such Loan Document, and may require that the transferee comply with
any provisions of this Instrument or any other Loan Document which previously
may have been waived by Lender;

                     (v)    Lender's receipt of all of the following:

                            (A)    a transfer fee equal to 1 percent of the
              Commitment immediately prior to the transfer.

                            (B)    In addition, Borrower shall be required to
              reimburse Lender for all of Lender's reasonable out-of-pocket
              costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in reviewing
              the Transfer request.

                     (ii)   A sale or other disposition of obsolete or worn out
personal property which is contemporaneously replaced by comparable personal
property of equal or greater value which is free and clear of Liens, other than

                     (iii)  The creation of a mechanic's or materialmen's lien

                     (iv)   The grant of an easement if, prior to the granting
of the easement, Borrower causes to be submitted to Lender all information
required by Lender to evaluate the easement, and if Lender consents to such
easement based upon Lender's determination that the easement will not materially
affect the operation of the Mortgaged Property or Lender's interest in the
Mortgaged Property and Borrower pays to Lender, on demand, all reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with reviewing Borrower's request.
Lender shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to or withhold its agreement

such failure, the Borrower shall (i) add Additional Mortgaged Properties to the
Collateral Pool in accordance with Article 3 so that after such addition the
Coverage and LTV Tests are met, or (ii) prepay Advances Outstanding in an amount
sufficient to cause the Borrower to be in compliance with the Coverage and LTV
Tests. Any prepayments made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be applied
first against the Variable Advances Outstanding in the sequence specified by
Borrower until there are no further Variable Advances Outstanding then against
the prepayment of Fixed Advances Outstanding so long as the prepayment is
permitted under the applicable Fixed Facility Note. If no prepayment is

be held by Lender (or its appointed collateral agent) as Substitute Cash
Collateral in accordance with a security agreement and other documents in form

will be returned to the Borrower on the earlier of (a) the date when the
Coverage and LTV Tests are again met (calculated using the definition of
"Facility Debt Service" set forth in paragraph (b) of such definition), provided
that such test may be met either as a result of additions of Mortgaged
Properties to the Collateral Pool or the deposit of Substitute Cash Collateral,
or (b) the Termination Date. If on the date the Borrower pays any amounts
required by this Section, Variable Advances are Outstanding but are not then due
and payable, Lender shall hold such amounts (which amounts shall bear interest
at a rate determined by Lender) as additional collateral until the next date on
the Variable Advances are due and payable at which time Lender shall apply the
appropriate portion of such prepayment to such Variable Advances.

       SECTION 8.18.       Financial Covenants.

Guarantor's Investment in DRA Venture, will be excluded:

              (a)    Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth. The Guarantor

              (f)    Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage. The Guarantor shall not
permit the ratio of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Fixed Charges
as of the end of any fiscal quarter of Guarantor to be less than 1.75:1.

which the financial covenants set forth in this Section 8.18 are based are
amended, modified or supplemented, upon the request of Borrower, Lender will

                                    REMEDIES

       SECTION 12.01.      Remedies; Waivers.

       Subject to Article 15 of this Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, Lender may do any one or more of the following (without presentment,
protest or notice of protest, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower):

              (a)    by written notice to Borrower, to be effective upon
dispatch, terminate the Commitment and declare the principal of, and interest
on, the Advances and all other sums owing by Borrower to Lender under any of the
Loan Documents forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Commitment will
terminate and the principal of, and interest on, the Advances and all other sums
owing by Borrower to Lender under any of the Loan Documents will become
forthwith due and payable.

              (b)    Lender shall have the right to pursue any other remedies
available to it under any of the Loan Documents.

              (c)    Lender shall have the right to pursue all remedies

       Lender shall have the right, to be exercised in its complete discretion,
to waive any breach hereunder (including the occurrence of an Event of Default),
by a writing setting forth the terms, conditions, and extent of such waiver
signed by Lender and delivered to Borrower. Unless such writing expressly
provides to the contrary, any waiver so granted shall extend only to the
specific event or occurrence which gave rise to the waiver and not to any other
similar event or occurrence which occurs subsequent to the date of such waiver.

       SECTION 12.03.      Lender's Right to Protect Collateral and Perform
                           Covenants and Other Obligations.

       If Borrower or Guarantor fails to perform the covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, then Lender at
Lender's option may make such appearances, disburse such sums and take such
action as Lender deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to protect Lender's
interest, including (i) disbursement of reasonable attorneys' fees, (ii) entry
upon the Mortgaged Property to make repairs and replacements, (iii) procurement
of satisfactory insurance as provided in Section 5 of the Security Instrument
encumbering the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) if the Security Instrument is on a
leasehold, exercise of any option to renew or extend the ground lease on behalf
of Borrower and the curing of any default of Borrower in the terms and
conditions of the ground lease. Any amounts disbursed by Lender pursuant to this
Section, with interest thereon, shall become additional indebtedness of Borrower
secured by the Loan Documents. Unless Borrower and Lender agree to other terms
of payment, such amounts shall be immediately due and payable and shall bear
interest from the date of disbursement at the weighted average, as determined by
Lender, of the interest rates in effect from time to time for each Advance
unless collection from Borrower of interest at such rate would be contrary to
applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest
rate which may be collected from Borrower under applicable law. Nothing
contained in this Section shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any
action hereunder.

       SECTION 12.04.      No Remedy Exclusive.

       Unless otherwise expressly provided, no remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy, but each
remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to other remedies given
under the Loan Documents or existing at law or in equity.

       SECTION 12.05.      No Waiver.

       No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing under any
Loan Document upon the happening of any Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time
and as often as may be deemed expedient.

       SECTION 12.06.      No Notice.

       To entitle Lender to exercise any remedy reserved to Lender in this
Article, it shall not be necessary to give any notice, other than such notice as
may be required under the applicable provisions of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents.

                              RIGHTS OF FANNIE MAE

       SECTION 13.01.      Special Pool Purchase Contract.

                                       46

<PAGE>

       Borrower acknowledges that Fannie Mae is entering into an agreement with
Lender ("Special Pool Purchase Contract"), pursuant to which, inter alia, (i)
Lender shall agree to assign all of its rights under this Agreement to Fannie
Mae, (ii) Fannie Mae shall accept the assignment of the rights, (iii) subject to
the terms, limitations and conditions contained in the Special Pool Purchase
Contract, Fannie Mae shall agree to purchase a 100% participation interest in
each Advance issued under this Agreement by issuing to Lender an MBS, in the
amount and for a term equal to the Advance purchased and backed by an interest
in the Fixed Facility Note or the Variable Facility Note, as the case may be,
and the Collateral Pool securing the Notes, (iv) Lender shall agree to assign to
Fannie Mae all of Lender's interest in the Notes and Collateral Pool securing
the Notes, and (v) Lender shall agree to service the loans evidenced by the
Notes.

       SECTION 13.02.      Assignment of Rights.

       Borrower acknowledges and consents to the assignment to Fannie Mae of all
of the rights of Lender under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents,
including the right and power to make all decisions on the part of Lender to be
made under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but Fannie Mae, by
virtue of this assignment, shall not be obligated to perform the obligations of
Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

       SECTION 13.03.      Release of Collateral.

       Borrower hereby acknowledges that, after the assignment of Loan Documents
contemplated in Section 13.02, Lender shall not have the right or power to
effect a release of any Collateral pursuant to Article 6. Borrower acknowledges
that the Security Instruments provide for the release of the Collateral under
Article 3. Accordingly, Borrower shall not look to Lender for performance of any
obligations contained in Article 3, but shall look solely to the party secured
by the Collateral to be released for such performance. Lender represents and
warrants to Borrower that the party secured by the Collateral shall be subject
to the release provisions contained in Article 3 by virtue of the release
provisions in each Security Instrument.

       SECTION 13.04.      Replacement of Lender.

       At the request of Fannie Mae, Borrower and Lender shall agree to the
assumption by another lender designated by Fannie Mae (which lender shall meet
Fannie Mae's then current standards for lenders for credit facilities of the
type and size of the credit facility evidenced by this Agreement), of all of the
obligations of Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and/or
any related servicing obligations, and, at Fannie Mae's option, the concurrent
release of Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and/or any related servicing obligations, and shall execute all
releases, modifications and other documents which Fannie Mae determines are
necessary or desirable to effect such assumption.

       SECTION 13.05.      Fannie Mae and Lender Fees and Expenses.

       Borrower agrees that any provision providing for the payment of fees,
costs or expenses incurred or charged by Lender pursuant to this Agreement shall
be deemed to provide for Borrower's payment of all reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred or charged by Lender or Fannie Mae in connection with the
matter for which fees, costs or expenses are payable.

       SECTION 13.06.    Third-Party Beneficiary.

       Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that Fannie Mae is a third party
beneficiary of all of the representations, warranties and covenants made by
Borrower to, and all rights under this Agreement conferred upon, Lender, and, by
virtue of its status as third-party beneficiary and/or assignee of Lender's
rights under this Agreement, Fannie Mae shall have the right to enforce all of
the provisions of this Agreement against Borrower.

Mortgaged Property.

       SECTION 14.02.      Replacement Reserves.

       Borrower shall execute a Replacement Reserve Agreement for the Mortgaged
Property which they own and shall (unless waived by Lender by separate
agreement) make all deposits for replacement reserves in accordance with the
terms of the Replacement Reserve Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 15

                          LIMITS ON PERSONAL LIABILITY

       SECTION 15.01.    Personal Liability to Borrower.

              (a)    Limits on Personal Liability. Prior to the Recourse
Termination Date, except as otherwise provided in this Article, the personal
liability of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document for
the performance of any Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents
shall be limited to an amount equal to 15% of the amount of Advances Outstanding
from time to time (the "Guaranteed Amount"), and the Lender's only recourse for
the payment and performance of the Obligations in excess of such Guaranteed
Amount shall be the Lender's exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to
the Mortgaged Properties and any other Collateral held by the Lender as security
for the Obligations. From and after the Recourse Termination Date, except as
provided in this Article, Borrower shall not be personally liable for the
Obligations. Except as otherwise set forth in the Guaranty, this limitation on
the Borrower's liability shall not limit or impair the Lender's enforcement of
its rights against any guarantor of all or part of the Obligations.

              (b)    Exceptions to Limits on Personal Liability. Borrower shall
be personally liable to Lender for the repayment of a portion of the Advances
and other amounts due under the Loan Documents equal to any loss or damage (but
not consequential loss or damage) suffered by Lender as a direct result of (1)
failure of Borrower to pay to Lender upon demand after an Event

                                       48

<PAGE>

of Default all Rents to which Lender is entitled under Section 3(a) of the
Security Instrument encumbering the Mortgaged Property and the amount of all
security deposits collected by Borrower from tenants then in residence; (2)
failure of Borrower to apply all insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds or
security deposits from tenants as required by the Security Instrument
encumbering the Mortgaged Property; (3) fraud or written material
misrepresentation by Borrower or Guarantor or any officer, director, partner,
member or employee of Borrower or Guarantor in connection with the application
for or creation of the Obligations or any request for any action or consent by
Lender; or (4) failure to apply Rents, first, to the payment of reasonable
operating expenses and then to amounts ("Debt Service Amounts") payable under
the Loan Documents (except that Borrower will not be personally liable (i) to
the extent that Borrower lacks the legal right to direct the disbursement of
such sums because of a bankruptcy, receivership or similar judicial proceeding,
or (ii) with respect to Rents of a Mortgaged Property that are distributed in
any Calendar Quarter if Borrower has paid all operating expenses and Debt
Service Amounts for that Calendar Quarter).

              (c)    Full Recourse. Borrower shall be personally liable to
Lender for the payment and performance of all Obligations upon the occurrence of
any of the following Events of Default: (1) Borrower's acquisition of any
property or operation of any business not permitted by Section 33 of any
Security Instrument; or (2) a Transfer that is an Event of Default under Section
21 of any Security Instrument; or (3) the failure to comply with any and all
indemnification obligations contained in Section 18 of any Security Instrument;
or (4) commencement of a voluntary case under the Federal Bankruptcy laws.

              (d)    Miscellaneous. To the extent that Borrower has personal
liability under this Section or the Guarantor has liability under the Guaranty,
such liability shall be joint and several and Lender may exercise its rights
against Borrower or Guarantor personally without regard to whether Lender has
exercised any rights against the Mortgaged Property or any other security, or
pursued any rights against any guarantor, or pursued any other rights available
to Lender under the Loan Documents or applicable law. For purposes of this
Article, the term "Mortgaged Property" shall not include any funds that (1) have
been applied by Borrower as required or permitted by the Loan Documents prior to
the occurrence of an Event of Default, or (2) are owned by Borrower or Guarantor
and which Borrower was unable to apply as required or permitted by the Loan
Documents because of a bankruptcy, receivership, or similar judicial proceeding.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

       SECTION 17.01.      Counterparts.

       To facilitate execution, this Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts. It shall not be necessary that the signatures of, or on behalf of,
each party, or that the signatures

                                       49

<PAGE>

of all persons required to bind any party, appear on each counterpart, but it
shall be sufficient that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party, appear
on one or more counterparts. All counterparts shall collectively constitute a
single agreement. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to
produce or account for more than the number of counterparts containing the
respective signatures of, or on behalf of, all of the parties hereto.

       SECTION 17.02.    Amendments, Changes and Modifications.

       This Agreement may be amended, changed, modified, altered or terminated
only by written instrument or written instruments signed by all of the parties
hereto.

       SECTION 17.03.      Payment of Costs, Fees and Expenses.

       Borrower shall pay, on demand, all reasonable fees, costs, charges or
expenses (including the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other
experts) incurred by Lender in connection with:

              (a)    Any amendment, consent or waiver to this Agreement or any
of the Loan Documents (whether or not any such amendments, consents or waivers
are entered into).

              (b)    Defending or participating in any litigation arising from
actions by third parties and brought against or involving Lender with respect to
(i) any Mortgaged Property, (ii) any event, act, condition or circumstance in
connection with any Mortgaged Property or (iii) the relationship between Lender
and Borrower and the Guarantor in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

              (c)    The administration or enforcement of, or preservation of
rights or remedies under, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or in
connection with the foreclosure upon, sale of or other disposition of any
Collateral granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.

              (d)    Any disclosure documents, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of Lender's attorneys and accountants.

Borrower shall also pay, on demand, any transfer taxes, documentary taxes,
assessments or charges made by any Governmental Authority by reason of the
execution, delivery, filing, recordation, performance or enforcement of any of
the Loan Documents or the Advances. However, Borrower will not be obligated to
pay any franchise, excise, estate, inheritance, income, excess profits or
similar tax on Lender. Any attorneys' fees and expenses payable by Borrower
pursuant to this Section shall be recoverable separately from and in addition to
any other amount included in such judgment, and such obligation is intended to
be severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and to survive and not
be merged into any such judgment. Any amounts payable by Borrower pursuant to
this Section, with interest thereon if not paid when due, shall become
additional indebtedness of Borrower secured by the Loan Documents. Such amounts
shall bear interest from the date such amounts are due until paid in full at the
weighted average, as determined by Lender, of the interest rates in effect from
time to time for each Advance unless collection from Borrower of interest at
such rate would be contrary to

                                       50

<PAGE>

applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest
rate which may be collected from Borrower under applicable law. The provisions
of this Section are cumulative with, and do not exclude the application and
benefit to Lender of, any provision of any other Loan Document relating to any
of the matters covered by this Section.

       SECTION 17.04.      Payment Procedure.

       All payments to be made to Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents shall be made in lawful currency of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by Lender before 1:00 p.m. (Washington, D.C. time) on the date when
due.

       SECTION 17.05.      Payments on Business Days.

       In any case in which the date of payment to Lender or the expiration of
any time period hereunder occurs on a day which is not a Business Day, then such
payment or expiration of such time period need not occur on such date but may be
made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on the day of maturity or expiration of such period, except that interest
shall continue to accrue for the period after such date to the next Business
Day.

       SECTION 17.06.      Choice of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of

disbursement is made shall be payable simultaneously with the execution of this
Note. Interest under this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months.

                                                                             B-1

<PAGE>

       (b)    Consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest, each
in the amount of ______________________________________ Dollars (US $ ), shall
be payable on the first day of each month beginning on _________________, until
the entire unpaid principal balance evidenced by this Note is fully paid. Any
accrued interest remaining past due for 30 days or more shall be added to and
become part of the unpaid principal balance and shall bear interest at the rate
or rates specified in this Note, and any reference below to "accrued interest"
shall refer to accrued interest which has not become part of the unpaid
principal balance. Any remaining principal and interest shall be due and payable
on _______________, 20__ or on any earlier date on which the unpaid principal
balance of this Note becomes due and payable, by acceleration or otherwise (the
"Maturity Date"). The unpaid principal balance shall continue to bear interest
after the Maturity Date at the Default Rate set forth in this Note until and
including the date on which it is paid in full.

       (c)    Any regularly scheduled monthly installment of principal and
interest that is received by Lender before the date it is due shall be deemed to
have been received on the due date solely for the purpose of calculating
interest due.

       4.     Application of Payments. If at any time Lender receives, from
Borrower or otherwise, any amount applicable to the Indebtedness that is less
than all amounts due and payable at such time, Lender may apply that payment to
amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by
Lender, in Lender's discretion. Borrower agrees that neither Lender's acceptance
of a payment from Borrower in an amount that is less than all amounts then due
and payable nor Lender's application of such payment shall constitute or be
deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and
satisfaction.

       5.     Intentionally Omitted.

       6.     Acceleration. If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance, any accrued interest, the
prepayment premium payable under Paragraph 10, if any, and all other amounts
payable under this Note and any other Loan Document shall at once become due and
payable, at the option of Lender, without any prior notice to Borrower. Lender
may exercise this option to accelerate regardless of any prior forbearance.

       7.     Late Charge. If any monthly amount payable under this Note or
under the Security Instruments or any other Loan Document is not received by
Lender within 10 days after the amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender,
immediately and without demand by Lender, a late charge equal to 5 percent of
such amount. Borrower acknowledges that its failure to make timely payments will
cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the loan
evidenced by this Note (the "Loan"), and that it is extremely difficult and
impractical to determine those additional expenses. Borrower agrees that the
late charge payable pursuant to this Paragraph represents a fair and reasonable
estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing on the date of this
Note, of the additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of such late
payment. The late charge is payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
interest payable at the Default Rate pursuant to Paragraph 8.

                                                                             B-2

<PAGE>

       8.     Default Rate. So long as any monthly installment or any other
payment due under this Note remains past due for 30 days or more, interest under
this Note shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance from the earlier of the
due date of the first unpaid monthly installment or other payment due, as
applicable, at a rate (the "Default Rate") equal to the lesser of 4 percentage
points above the rate stated in the first paragraph of this Note or the maximum
interest rate which may be collected from Borrower under applicable law. If the
unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest are not paid in full on the
Maturity Date, the unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest shall bear
interest from the Maturity Date at the Default Rate. Borrower also acknowledges
that its failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional
expenses in servicing and processing the Loan, that, during the time that any
monthly installment or payment under this Note is delinquent for more than 30
days, Lender will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of
the use of the money due and from the adverse impact on Lender's ability to meet
its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities,
and that it is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional
costs and expenses. Borrower also acknowledges that, during the time that any
monthly installment or other payment due under this Note is delinquent for more
than 30 days, Lender's risk of nonpayment of this Note will be materially
increased and Lender is entitled to be compensated for such increased risk.
Borrower agrees that the increase in the rate of interest payable under this
Note to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into
account all circumstances existing on the date of this Note, of the additional
costs and expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower's delinquent payment
and the additional compensation Lender is entitled to receive for the increased
risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquent loan.

       9.     Limits on Personal Liability.

       The provisions of Article 15 of the Master Agreement (entitled "Limits on
Personal Liability") are hereby incorporated into this Note by this reference to
the fullest extent as if the text of such Article were set forth in its entirety
herein.

       10.    Voluntary and Involuntary Prepayments.

       [USE IF YIELD MAINTENANCE IS SELECTED]

       (a)    A prepayment premium shall be payable in connection with any
prepayment made under this Note as provided below:

              (1)    Borrower may voluntarily prepay all (but not less than all)
       of the unpaid principal balance of this Note on the last Business Day of
       a calendar month if Borrower has given Lender at least 30 days prior
       notice of its intention to make such prepayment. Such prepayment shall be
       made by paying (A) the amount of principal being prepaid, (B) all accrued
       interest, (C) all other sums due Lender under this Note and otherwise due
       and payable in connection with such prepayment under the other Loan
       Documents at the time of such prepayment, and (D) the prepayment premium
       calculated pursuant to Schedule A. For all purposes, including the
       accrual of interest, any prepayment received by Lender on any day other
       than the last calendar day of the month shall be deemed to have been

                                                                             B-3

<PAGE>

       received on the last calendar day of such month. For purposes of this
       Note, a "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any
       other day on which Lender is not open for business.

              (2)    Upon Lender's exercise of any right of acceleration under
       this Note, Borrower shall pay to Lender, in addition to the entire unpaid
       principal balance of this Note outstanding at the time of the
       acceleration, (A) all accrued interest and all other sums due Lender
       under this Note and the other Loan Documents, and (B) the prepayment
       premium calculated pursuant to Schedule A.

              (3)    Any application by Lender of any collateral or other
       security to the repayment of any portion of the unpaid principal balance
       of this Note prior to the Maturity Date and in the absence of
       acceleration shall be deemed to be a partial prepayment by Borrower,
       requiring the payment to Lender by Borrower of a prepayment premium. The
       amount of any such partial prepayment shall be computed so as to provide
       to Lender a prepayment premium computed pursuant to Schedule A without
       Borrower having to pay out-of-pocket any additional amounts.

              (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 10(a), no
prepayment premium shall be payable with respect to (A) any prepayment made no
more than 90 days before the Maturity Date, or (B) any prepayment occurring as a
result of the application of any insurance proceeds or condemnation award under
any Security Instrument.

              (c)    Schedules A and B are hereby incorporated by reference into
this Note.

              (d)    Any required prepayment of less than the unpaid principal
balance of this Note shall be applied to the final payment due in respect of
this Note and shall not extend or postpone the due date of any other monthly
installments or change the amount of such installments, unless Lender agrees
otherwise in writing.

              (e)    Borrower recognizes that any prepayment of the unpaid
principal balance of this Note, whether voluntary or involuntary or resulting
from a default by Borrower, will result in Lender's incurring loss, including
reinvestment loss, additional expense and frustration or impairment of Lender's
ability to meet its commitments to third parties. Borrower agrees to pay to
Lender upon demand damages for the detriment caused by any prepayment, and
agrees that it is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of
such damages. Borrower therefore acknowledges and agrees that the formula for
calculating prepayment premiums set forth on Schedule A represents a reasonable
estimate of the damages Lender will incur because of a prepayment.

              (f)    Borrower further acknowledges that the prepayment premium
provisions of this Note are a material part of the consideration for the loan
evidenced by this Note, and acknowledges that the terms of this Note are in
other respects more favorable to Borrower as a result of Borrower's voluntary
agreement to the prepayment premium provisions.

                                                                             B-4

<PAGE>

       11.    Costs and Expenses. Borrower shall pay on demand all reasonable
expenses and costs, including fees and out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys and
expert witnesses and costs of investigation, incurred by Lender as a result of
any default under this Note or in connection with efforts to collect any amount
due under this Note, or to enforce the provisions of any of the other Loan
Documents, including those incurred in post-judgment collection efforts and in
any bankruptcy proceeding (including any action for relief from the automatic
stay of any bankruptcy proceeding) or judicial or non-judicial foreclosure
proceeding.

       12.    Forbearance. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or
remedy under this Note, the Security Instruments, or any other Loan Document or
otherwise afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the
exercise of that or any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of any
payment after the due date of such payment, or in an amount which is less than
the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender's right to require prompt
payment when due of all other payments or to exercise any right or remedy with
respect to any failure to make prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any
security for Borrower's obligations under this Note shall not constitute an
election by Lender of remedies so as to preclude the exercise of any other right
or remedy available to Lender.

       13.    Waivers. Except as expressly provided in the Master Agreement,
presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of acceleration, notice
of intent to demand or accelerate payment or maturity, presentment for payment,
notice of nonpayment, grace, and diligence in collecting the Indebtedness are
waived by Borrower and all endorsers and guarantors of this Note and all other
third party obligors.

       14.    Loan Charges. If any applicable law limiting the amount of
interest or other charges permitted to be collected from Borrower in connection
with the Loan is interpreted so that any interest or other charge provided for
in any Loan Document, whether considered separately or together with other
charges provided for in any other Loan Document, violates that law, and Borrower
is entitled to the benefit of that law, that interest or charge is hereby
reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate that violation. Borrower agrees to
an effective rate of interest that is the stated rate of interest plus any
additional rate of interest resulting from any other charges or fees that are to
be paid by Borrower to Lender that may be found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be interest. The amounts, if any, previously paid to Lender in
excess of the permitted amounts shall be applied by Lender to reduce the unpaid
principal balance of this Note. For the purpose of determining whether any
applicable law limiting the amount of interest or other charges permitted to be
collected from Borrower has been violated, all Indebtedness that constitutes
interest, as well as all other charges made in connection with the Indebtedness
that constitute interest, shall be deemed to be allocated and spread ratably
over the stated term of the Note. Unless otherwise required by applicable law,
such allocation and spreading shall be effected in such a manner that the rate
of interest so computed is uniform throughout the stated term of the Note.

       15.    Commercial Purpose. Borrower represents that the Indebtedness is
being incurred by Borrower solely for the purpose of carrying on a business or
commercial enterprise, and not for personal, family or household purposes.

                                                                             B-5

<PAGE>

       16.    Counting of Days. Except where otherwise specifically provided,
any reference in this Note to a period of "days" means calendar days, not
Business Days.

       17.    Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue; WAIVER OF TRIAL
BY JURY. The provisions of Section 17.06 of the Master Agreement (entitled
"Choice of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial") are hereby
incorporated into this Note by this reference to the fullest extent as if the
text of such Section were set forth in its entirety herein.

       18.    Captions. The captions of the paragraphs of this Note are for
convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Note.

       19.    Notices. All notices, demands and other communications required or
permitted to be given by Lender to Borrower pursuant to this Note shall be given
in accordance with Section 17.08 of the Master Agreement.

       20.    Security for this Note. The indebtedness evidenced by this Note is
secured by the Security Documents executed by Borrower or its Affiliates.
Reference is made hereby to the Master Agreement and the Security Documents for
additional rights and remedies of Lender relating to the indebtedness evidenced
by this Note. Each Security Document shall be released in accordance with the
provisions of the Master Agreement and the Security Documents.

       21.    Fixed Facility. This Note is issued as part of the Fixed Facility
established in accordance with the terms of the Master Agreement. Borrower may
not re-borrow any amounts under this Note which it has previously borrowed and
repaid under this Note.

       22.    Cross-Default with Master Agreement. The occurrence of an Event of
Default under the Master Agreement shall constitute an "Event of Default" under
this Note, and, accordingly, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under
the Master Agreement, the entire principal amount outstanding hereunder and
accrued interest thereon shall at once become due and payable, at the option of
the holder hereof.

       obtained by multiplying:

                      MODIFICATIONS TO FIXED FACILITY NOTE

       The Fixed Facility Note dated ___________, 20___, in the original
principal amount of $____________ (the "Note") issued by
_____________________________, a _____________________________ ("Borrower"), and
payable to the order of PRUDENTIAL MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Lender") is hereby amended as follows:

       1.     Defeasance. Notwithstanding Paragraph 10 of this Note, Advances
are not prepayable at any time, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Borrower may prepay the amount Outstanding with respect to the Facility
during the period ending on the date ninety (90) days preceding the Facility
Termination Date (the "Lockout Period") and the Borrower may provide for the
Defeasance of all (but not less than all) of the Advances Outstanding pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Section 1 in connection with the release of
Mortgaged Properties in conformance with Section 6.05 of the Master Agreement.

              (a)    Conditions. Subject to Section 1(d), the Borrower shall
       have the right to obtain the release of all the Mortgaged Properties from
       the lien of the related Security Instruments upon the satisfaction of all
       of the following conditions:

                     (1)    Defeasance Notice. At the request of the Borrower,
              the Lender shall deliver to Borrower a notice (the "Defeasance
              Notice"), specifying: (i) a Business Day, not more than 45
              calendar days nor less than 30 calendar days after the date on
              which the Defeasance Notice is delivered by Lender (the
              "Defeasance Closing Date"), on which the Defeasance shall be
              consummated; (ii) the Mortgaged Property or Properties proposed to
              be released and the related Allocable Facility Amount (the
              "Defeased Amount");(iii) whether the Borrower will use U.S.
              Treasury Securities to effect the Defeasance or that the Lender
              will on the Borrower's behalf seek to obtain a commitment for a
              Fannie Mae Investment Security to effect the Defeasance; and (iv)
              whether, if Treasury Securities are to be used to effect the
              Defeasance, the Successor Borrower will be designated by the
              Borrower or Lender. Within five (5) Business Days of receipt after
              Defeasance Notice, the Borrower shall, if it wishes to proceed
              with the transaction described in the Defeasance Notice, sign the
              Defeasance Notice and return it to the Lender.

                     (2)    Lender Confirmation. With reasonable promptness, the
              Lender shall determine whether Defeasance is then permitted as
              provided in Section 1(d), whether the terms of the Defeasance
              Notice are reasonably acceptable to it and, if requested to do so
              by the Defeasance Notice, shall obtain from Fannie Mae a
              commitment to issue a Fannie Mae Investment Security to effect the
              Defeasance.

                                                                            B-12

              Lender shall, thereupon, notify the Borrower of its determination
              and, if it is able to obtain a commitment from Fannie Mae to issue
              a Fannie Mae Investment Security to effect the Defeasance, the
              price of such Fannie Mae Investment Security. After Lender
              notifies the Borrower of the availability of a Fannie Mae
              Investment Security in accordance with the foregoing, the Borrower
              will have one (1) Business Day to accept such commitment and to
              pay the related Defeasance Commitment Fee.

                     (3)    Closing Documents. The Borrower shall deliver to
              Lender on or before the Defeasance Closing Date the documents
              described in Section 1(b).

                     (4)    U.S. Treasury Securities; Defeasance Deposit. If
              U.S. Treasury Securities will be used to effect the Defeasance,
              then, on the Defeasance Closing Date, the Borrower shall cause the
              applicable U.S. Treasury Securities to be delivered pursuant to
              the Pledge Agreement referred to below. If a Fannie Mae Investment
              Security will be used to effect the Defeasance, then, on or before
              3:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time, on the Defeasance Closing Date,
              the Borrower shall pay the Defeasance Deposit (reduced by the
              Defeasance Commitment Fee) to, or as directed by, Lender to be
              used by Lender to purchase the Fannie Mae Investment Security as
              the Borrower's agent.

                     (5)    Additional Amounts Payable by the Borrower. On or
              before the Defeasance Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to
              Lender, in addition to the U.S. Treasury Securities or the
              Defeasance Deposit (reduced by the Defeasance Commitment Fee), an
              amount equal to the sum of:

                            (A)    The Next Scheduled P&I Payment; and

                            (B)    all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
                     Lender in connection with the Defeasance, including the
                     fees and disbursements of Lender's legal counsel.

                     (6)    Covenants, Representations and Warranties. On the
              Defeasance Closing Date, the Borrower shall be in compliance with
              all the covenants of the Borrower set forth in Articles 14, 15, 16
              and 20 of the Master Agreement and all the representations and
              warranties of the Borrower set forth in Articles 12 and 13 (solely
              with respect to Mortgaged Properties that continue to be security
              for the balance of the Facility) of the Master Agreement shall be
              true and correct in all material respects as if made on such
              Defeasance Closing Date.

              (b)    Closing Documents. The documents required to be delivered
       to Lender on or before the Defeasance Closing Date pursuant to Section
       1(a)(3) are:

              (1)    A pledge and security agreement, in form and substance
       satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion (the "Pledge Agreement"),
       creating a first priority perfected security interest in favor of Lender
       in the U.S. Treasury Securities or Fannie Mae Investment Security to be
       used to effect the Defeasance and authorizing and directing that

                                                                            B-13

       to make Defeased Payments due with respect to the Defeased Amount.

              (2)    An assignment and assumption agreement (the "Assignment and
       Assumption Agreement"), in form and substance satisfactory to Lender,
       executed by the Borrower and a successor entity (the "Successor
       Borrower"), designated by Lender or Borrower as provided in the
       Defeasance Notice and acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion,
       providing for (i) the transfer and assignment by the Borrower to
       Successor Borrower of the U.S. Treasury Securities, subject to the lien
       and security interest in favor of Lender, (ii) the assumption by
       Successor Borrower of all liabilities and obligations of the Borrower
       with respect to the Defeased Amount and (iii) the release by Lender of
       the Borrower from all liabilities and obligations with respect to the
       Defeased Amount. The Lender shall execute the Assignment and Assumption
       Agreement for the purpose of acknowledging the release of the Borrower's
       obligations with respect to the Defeased Amount and return a counterpart
       to the Borrower and Successor Borrower; provided, however, that such
       acknowledgement shall not be a condition to the Defeasance

              (3)    An opinion of counsel for the Borrower, in form and
       substance satisfactory to Lender, to the effect that (i) Lender has a
       valid and perfected lien and security interest of first priority in the
       U.S. Treasury Securities or Fannie Mae Investment Security and the
       proceeds thereof; (ii) the Pledge Agreement and the Assignment and
       Assumption Agreement have been duly authorized and validly executed and
       delivered by the Borrower and the Successor Borrower; and (iii) the
       Defeasance, including the granting to Lender by both the Borrower and the
       Substitute Borrower of a lien and security interest in the U.S. Treasury
       Securities or Fannie Mae Investment Security used to effect the
       Defeasance, is not subject to avoidance under any applicable federal or
       state laws, including Sections 547 and 548 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

              (4)    Unless waived by Lender:

              Investment Security used to effect the Defeasance due, on or
              before each date on which a Defeased Payment is due, are not less
              than such Defeased Payment;

                     (B)    an opinion of counsel for the Borrower in form and
              substance satisfactory to Lender, that the Defeasance will not
              result in a "sale or exchange" within the meaning of Section
              1001(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and the temporary and final
              regulations promulgated thereunder; and

                     (C)    such other opinions, certificates, documents or
              instruments as Lender may reasonably request.

       (c)    Release. Upon the Borrower's compliance with the requirements of
Sections 1(a) and (b), the Mortgaged Properties shall be released from the lien
of the Security Instruments.

                                                                            B-14

<PAGE>

Lender shall, with reasonable promptness, execute and deliver to the Borrower,
at the Borrower's cost and expense, any additional documents reasonably
requested by the Borrower in order to evidence or confirm the release of the
Security Instruments.

       (d)    Defeasance Not Allowed. The Borrower shall not have the right to
obtain a Defeasance at any of the following times:

              (1)    before the third anniversary of the Initial Closing Date;
       or

              (2)    after Lender has accelerated the maturity of the unpaid
       principal balance of, accrued interest on, and other amounts payable with
       respect to the Advances.

       (e)    Agent. If a Fannie Mae Investment Security is to be used to effect
the Defeasance, the Borrower authorizes Lender to use, and appoints Lender as
its agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of using, the Defeasance Deposit
(including any portion thereof that constitutes the Defeasance Commitment Fee)
to purchase a Fannie Mae Investment Security and to deliver such Fannie Mae
Investment Security to itself in satisfaction of the Allocable Facility Amount
to be defeased.

       (f)    Administrative Provisions.

              (1)    Fannie Mae Investment Security Liquidated Damages. If,
       after accepting a commitment from the Lender to provide a Fannie Mae
       Investment Security, the Borrower fails to perform its obligations under
       Sections 1(a) and 1(b), Lender shall have the right to retain any
       Defeasance Commitment Fee as liquidated damages for the Borrower's
       default, as Lender's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to its
       expenses in obtaining from Fannie Mae a commitment to issue the Fannie
       Mae Investment Security, and, except as provided in Section 1(f)(2), the
       Borrower shall be released from all further obligations under this
       Section 1 with respect to such Defeasance Notice. The Borrower
       acknowledges that, from and after the date on which Lender has delivered
       the Defeasance Commitment Fee, Lender will incur financing costs in
       obtaining a commitment for the issuance of the Fannie Mae Investment
       Security and agrees that the Defeasance Commitment Fee represents a fair
       and reasonable estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing
       on the date of the Master Agreement, of the damages (other than third
       party costs referred to in Section 1(f)(2)) Lender will incur by reason
       of the Borrower's default.

              (2)    Third Party Costs. The Borrower agrees to reimburse Lender
       for all reasonable third party costs and expenses, including attorneys'
       fees and expenses, incurred by Lender in reliance on the Defeasance
       Notice, within ten (10) Business Days after the Borrower receives a
       written demand for payment, accompanied by a statement, in reasonable
       detail, of Lender's third party costs and expenses.

              (3)    Payments. All payments required to be made by the Borrower
       to Lender pursuant to this Section 1 shall be made by wire transfer of
       immediately available finds to the account(s) designated by Lender.

                                                                            B-15

       Security or (ii) a valid and perfected lien and security interest of
       first priority in the U.S. Treasury Securities the payments on which, in

       Facility on the Facility Termination Date if all prior Defeased Payments
       were paid on their due dates.

              (5)    "Fannie Mae Investment Security" means any bond, debenture,
       note, participation certificate or other similar obligation issued by

       Allocable Facility Amount..

              (6)    "Next Scheduled P&I Payment" means an amount equal to the

                     (i)    the Defeasance Deposit that would be payable by
              Borrower to Lender if the Defeasance Deposit were calculated on
              the Business Day before the date on which Lender accelerates this
              Note (and assuming that the "Defeasance Closing Date" defined in
              the Master Agreement is the date Lender accelerates the Note),
              plus the next scheduled payment of principal and interest due in
              the month following the month Lender accelerates this Note, or

                     (ii)   all accrued interest and the unpaid principal

       lien of the Security Instrument pursuant to Section 1 of this Schedule B,

       shall be made to the Pledge Agreement for other rights of Lender

                                                  --------

                                                                            B-17

                  EXHIBIT C TO MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT

                             VARIABLE FACILITY NOTE

US $__________________                                           _________, 20__

       FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned ("Borrower") promises to pay to the
order of PRUDENTIAL MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE, INC., a Delaware corporation, the
principal sum of _________________________ Dollars and 00/100 Dollars (US
$________________________), or so much as shall be Outstanding from time to
time, with interest thereon at an annual rate as calculated in Section 3 hereof.

       This Note is executed and delivered by Borrower pursuant to that certain
Master Credit Facility Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2003, by and between
Borrower and Lender (as amended from time to time, the "Master Agreement"), to
evidence the obligation of Borrower to repay Variable Advances made by Lender to
Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Master Agreement. This Note is
entitled to the benefit and security of the Loan Documents provided for in the
Master Agreement, to which reference is hereby made for a statement of all of
the terms and conditions under which the Variable Advances evidenced hereby is
made. The Master Agreement requires certain of the terms of each Variable
Advance to be evidenced by an Advance Confirmation Instrument, and reference is
hereby made to each such Advance Confirmation Instrument for such terms.

       This Note is issued as part of a Variable Facility established in
accordance with the terms of the Master Agreement. Subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations of Article 1 of the Master Agreement, Borrower may
re-borrow any amounts under this Note which they have previously borrowed and
repaid under this Note.

       1.     Defined Terms. As used in this Note, (i) the term "Lender" means
the holder of this Note, and (ii) the term "Indebtedness" means the principal
of, interest on, or any other amounts due at any time under, this Note, and, to
the extent in respect hereof, the Security Instruments or any other Loan
Document, including prepayment premiums, late charges, default interest, and
advances to protect the security of the Security Instruments under Section 12 of
the Security Instruments. Event of Default and other capitalized terms used but
not defined in this Note shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Master Agreement or, if not defined in the Master Agreement, as defined in the
Security Instruments (as defined in Paragraph 5).

       2.     Address for Payment. All payments due under this Note shall be
payable at Prudential Multifamily Mortgage, Inc., a Delaware corporation, c/o
Prudential Asset Resources, 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 4200E, Dallas, Texas 75201,
or such other place as may be designated by written notice to Borrower from or
on behalf of Lender.

                                                                             C-1

<PAGE>

       3.     Payment of Principal and Interest. Principal and interest shall be
paid as follows:

       (a)    This Note shall evidence Variable Advances made from time to time
under the Master Agreement. Each Variable Advance shall bear interest at a rate
determined in accordance with Section 2.01 of the Master Agreement.

       (b)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 1.04(b) of the Master
Agreement, Borrower shall pay imputed interest on each Variable Advance in
advance in the form of a Discount in accordance with Section 1.04(b) of the
Master Agreement (except that Borrower shall pay actual interest on the Variable
Advance for the partial month period, if any, in accordance with Section 1.04(a)
of the Master Agreement). If not sooner paid, the entire principal amount (which
amount shall not include the Discount, which Discount is paid in advance) of
each Variable Advance shall be due and payable on the maturity date of the
applicable Variable Advance (the "Maturity Date") in accordance with Section
1.03 of the Master Agreement. In addition to payment of principal and the
Discount, Borrower shall pay the Variable Facility Fee due on each Variable
Advance in accordance with Section 1.04(b)(ii) of the Master Agreement. No
Variable Advance may have a Maturity Date later than, and any then outstanding
Variable Advance shall be due and payable in full on, the related Variable
Facility Termination Date.

       4.     Application of Payments. If at any time Lender receives, from
Borrower or otherwise, any amount applicable to the Indebtedness that is less
than all amounts due and payable at such time, Lender may apply that payment to
amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by
Lender, in Lender's discretion. Borrower agrees that neither Lender's acceptance
of a payment from Borrower in an amount that is less than all amounts then due
and payable nor Lender's application of such payment shall constitute or be
deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and
satisfaction.

       5.     Security. The Indebtedness is secured, among other things, by the
Security Instruments described in the Master Agreement and reference is made to
the Security Instruments for other rights of Lender concerning the collateral
for the Indebtedness.

       6.     Acceleration. If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance, any accrued interest, the
prepayment premium payable under Paragraph 10, if any, and all other amounts
payable under this Note and any other Loan Document shall at once become due and
payable, at the option of Lender, without any prior notice to Borrower. Lender
may exercise this option to accelerate regardless of any prior forbearance.

       7.     Late Charge. If any monthly amount payable under this Note or
under the Security Instrument or any other Loan Document is not received by
Lender within 10 days after the amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender,
immediately and without demand by Lender, a late charge equal to 5 percent of
such amount. Borrower acknowledges that its failure to make timely payments will
cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the loan
evidenced by this Note (the "Loan"), and that it is extremely difficult and
impractical to

                                                                             C-2

<PAGE>

determine those additional expenses. Borrower agrees that the late charge
payable pursuant to this Paragraph represents a fair and reasonable estimate,
taking into account all circumstances existing on the date of this Note, of the
additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of such late payment. The late
charge is payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any interest payable at
the Default Rate pursuant to Paragraph 8.

       8.     Default Rate. So long as any monthly installment or any other
payment due under this Note remains past due for 30 days or more, interest under
this Note shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance from the earlier of the
due date of the first unpaid monthly installment or other payment due, as
applicable, at a rate (the "Default Rate") equal to the lesser of 4 percentage
points above the rate stated in the first paragraph of this Note or the maximum
interest rate which may be collected from Borrower under applicable law. If the
unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest are not paid in full on the
Maturity Date, the unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest shall bear
interest from the Maturity Date at the Default Rate. Borrower also acknowledges
that its failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional
expenses in servicing and processing the Loan, that, during the time that any
monthly installment or payment under this Note is delinquent for more than 30
days, Lender will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of
the use of the money due and from the adverse impact on Lender's ability to meet
its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities,
and that it is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional
costs and expenses. Borrower also acknowledges that, during the time that any
monthly installment or other payment due under this Note is delinquent for more
than 30 days, Lender's risk of nonpayment of this Note will be materially
increased and Lender is entitled to be compensated for such increased risk.
Borrower agrees that the increase in the rate of interest payable under this
Note to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into
account all circumstances existing on the date of this Note, of the additional
costs and expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower's delinquent payment
and the additional compensation Lender is entitled to receive for the increased
risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquent loan.

       9.     Limits on Personal Liability.

       The provisions of Article 15 of the Master Agreement (entitled "Limits on
Personal Liability") are hereby incorporated into this Note by this reference to
the fullest extent as if the text of such Article were set forth in its entirety
herein.

       10.    Voluntary and Involuntary Prepayments.

              Pursuant to the terms of the Master Agreement, Borrower shall pay
the entire amount of the Discount on any Variable Advance in advance.
Accordingly, any Variable Advance may be prepaid in whole or in part and at any
time without penalty. Borrower shall give Lender five Business Days advance
notice of any prepayment.

       11.    Costs and Expenses. Borrower shall pay on demand all reasonable
expenses and costs, including reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
attorneys and expert witnesses and costs of investigation, incurred by Lender as
a result of any default under this Note or in

                                                                             C-3

connection with efforts to collect any amount due under this Note, or to enforce
the provisions of any of the other Loan Documents, including those incurred in
post-judgment collection efforts and in any bankruptcy proceeding (including any
action for relief from the automatic stay of any bankruptcy proceeding) or
judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceeding.

       12.    Forbearance. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or
remedy under this Note, the Security Instrument, or any other Loan Document or
otherwise afforded by applicable law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the
exercise of that or any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of any
payment after the due date of such payment, or in an amount which is less than
the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender's right to require prompt
payment when due of all other payments or to exercise any right or remedy with
respect to any failure to make prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any
security for Borrower's obligations under this Note shall not constitute an
election by Lender of remedies so as to preclude the exercise of any other right
or remedy available to Lender.

       13.    Waivers. Except as expressly provided in the Master Agreement,
presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of acceleration, notice
of intent to demand or accelerate payment or maturity, presentment for payment,
notice of nonpayment, grace, and diligence in collecting the Indebtedness are
waived by Borrower and all endorsers and guarantors of this Note and all other
third party obligors.

       14.    Loan Charges. If any applicable law limiting the amount of
interest or other charges permitted to be collected from Borrower in connection
with the Loan is interpreted so that any interest or other charge provided for
in any Loan Document, whether considered separately or together with other
charges provided for in any other Loan Document, violates that law, and Borrower
is entitled to the benefit of that law, that interest or charge is hereby
reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate that violation. Borrower agrees to
an effective rate of interest that is the stated rate of interest plus any
additional rate of interest resulting from any other charges or fees that are to
be paid by Borrower to Lender that may be found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be interest. The amounts, if any, previously paid to Lender in
excess of the permitted amounts shall be applied by Lender to reduce the unpaid
principal balance of this Note. For the purpose of determining whether any
applicable law limiting the amount of interest or other charges permitted to be
collected from Borrower has been violated, all Indebtedness that constitutes
interest, as well as all other charges made in connection with the Indebtedness
that constitute interest, shall be deemed to be allocated and spread ratably
over the stated term of the Note. Unless otherwise required by applicable law,
such allocation and spreading shall be effected in such a manner that the rate
of interest so computed is uniform throughout the stated term of the Note.

       15.    Commercial Purpose. Borrower represents that the Indebtedness is
being incurred by Borrower solely for the purpose of carrying on a business or
commercial enterprise, and not for personal, family or household purposes.

       16.    Counting of Days. Except where otherwise specifically provided,
any reference in this Note to a period of "days" means calendar days, not
Business Days.

                                                                             C-4

       17.    Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The
provisions of Section 17.06 of the Master Agreement (entitled "Choice of Law;
Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial") are hereby incorporated into
this Note by this reference to the fullest extent as if the text of such Section
were set forth in its entirety herein.

       18.    Captions. The captions of the paragraphs of this Note are for
convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Note.

       19.    Notices. All notices, demands and other communications required or
permitted to be given by Lender to Borrower pursuant to this Note shall be given
in accordance with Section 17.08 of the Master Agreement.

       20.    Cross-Default with Master Agreement. The occurrence of an Event of
Default under the Master Agreement shall constitute an "Event of Default" under
this Note, and, accordingly, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under
the Master Agreement, the entire principal amount outstanding hereunder and
accrued interest thereon shall at once become due and payable, at the option of
the holder hereof.

       21.    Advance Confirmation Instruments; Accounting for Variable
Advances. The terms of the Master Agreement and this Note govern the repayment,
and all other terms relating to each Variable Advance. However, Borrower shall
execute an Advance Confirmation Instrument to create a physical instrument
evidencing the Variable Advance. The Advance Confirmation Instrument for a
Variable Advance executed by Borrower in accordance with Section 2.02 of the
Master Agreement shall set forth the amount, term, Discount, Closing Date and
certain other terms of the Variable Advance. The Advance Confirmation Instrument
shall conclusively establish each of the terms described in the preceding
sentence, absent manifest error. The Variable Advance evidenced by the Advance
Confirmation Instrument does not represent a separate indebtedness from that
evidenced by this Note. In making proof of this Note, no other documents other
than this Note shall be required. In making proof of the amount and terms of the
outstanding Variable Advances under this Note, this Note, the Advance
Confirmation Instruments for the Variable Advances, and Lender's records
concerning payments made by Borrower under this Note, shall be conclusive
evidence of the terms and outstanding amounts of each Variable Advance, absent
manifest error.

       23.    Priority of Advances. Each Variable Advance under this Note shall
be evidenced by an Advance Confirmation Instrument, and the lien of each
Security Document executed by Borrower from time to time to secure this Note,
shall secure each separate Advance (and the lien of each Security Instrument and
other Security Document executed by Borrower to secure its obligations under the
Loan Documents) to the same extent and with the same effect as if the Advance
had been made (and any guaranty obligation had been incurred) on the date on
which (i) with respect to each other Security Instrument, the Security
Instrument is recorded in the land records of the jurisdiction in which the real
property covered by the Security Instrument is located, or (ii) with respect to
each other Security Document, the date on which the Security Document is
executed and delivered to Lender.

                                                                             C-5

                  EXHIBIT S TO MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT

                                    GUARANTY

              This Guaranty (the "Guaranty") is made and entered into as of the
2nd day of May, 2003 by BRE PROPERTIES, INC., a Maryland corporation (the
"Guarantor"), for the benefit of PRUDENTIAL MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Lender").

                                    RECITALS

       A.     Lender has agreed to execute that certain Master Credit Facility
Agreement, dated as of May 2, 2003 (as amended from time to time, the "Master
Agreement"), pursuant to which, inter alia, Lender has agreed, subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations of the Master Agreement, to loan to the
borrower signatory thereto (the "Borrower") from time to time Advances (each, an
"Advance" and, collectively, the "Advances") to be evidenced by the Note.

       B.     The repayment of the Advances and all of the other obligations of
the Borrower under the Master Agreement or the other Loan Documents are
guaranteed by this Guaranty to the extent of the Borrower's personal liability
as provided in Article 15 of the Master Agreement.

       C.     Guarantor owns, directly or indirectly, an ownership interest in
the Borrower and will receive a direct and material benefit from the Advances to
the Borrower.

       D.     Lender is willing to make the Advances to the Borrower only if
Guarantor agrees to enter into this Guaranty.

       NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce Lender to make the Advances to
Borrower, and in consideration thereof, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

       Section 1.    Definitions. All capitalized terms used but not defined in
this Guaranty shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Master
Agreement.

       Section 2.    Guaranty of Payment. Guarantor irrevocably, absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees to Lender the due and punctual payment of all amounts
for which Borrower is personally liable under Article 15 of the Master Agreement
(the "Guaranteed Obligations").

This Guaranty shall be an unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and
not of collection, and is in no way conditioned upon any attempt by Lender to
pursue or exhaust any remedy against Borrower. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty which shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Guaranteed
Obligations have been paid and performed in full; and Guarantor shall not be
released from any obligations to Lender under this Guaranty as long as any
amount payable by the Borrower to Lender, or any obligation by the Borrower,
under the Loan Documents is not performed, satisfied, settled or paid in full.

                                       S-1

<PAGE>

       Section 3.    Form of Payment. All payments under this Guaranty shall be
made to Lender in immediately available funds, without reduction by any
recoupment, set-off, counterclaim or cross-claim against Lender.

       Section 4.    Guarantor's Obligations are Absolute. The obligations of
Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be
subject to any counterclaim, set-off, recoupment, deduction, or defense (other
than the defense of payment) based upon any claim Guarantor may have against
Lender or Borrower and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to,
and shall not be released, discharged or terminated or in any other way affected
by, any circumstance or condition (whether or not Guarantor shall have any
knowledge or notice thereof), including, without limitation:

       (a)    any amendment or modification of, or extension of time for payment
of any of the principal of, interest on or other amounts payable under the Loan
Documents;

       (b)    any exercise or non-exercise by Lender of any right, power or
remedy under or in respect of the Loan Documents, or any waiver, consent,
forbearance, indulgence or other action, inaction or omission by Lender under or
in respect of the Loan Documents;

       (c)    any assignment, sale or other transfer of Borrower's interest in
all or any part of the real or personal property which at any time constitutes
collateral for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without
limitation, a conveyance of such property by Borrower to Lender by deed in lieu
of foreclosure;

       (d)    any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, adjustment,
dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding involving or affecting
Borrower or Lender or their respective properties or creditors, or any action
taken with respect to the Loan Documents by any trustee or receiver of Borrower
or Lender, or by any court, in any such proceeding;

       (e)    any invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any
term or provision of the Loan Documents or Borrower's incapacity or lack of
authority to enter into the Loan Documents;

       (f)    any release, compromise, settlement or discharge with respect to
all or any portion of Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents;

       (g)    any acceptance of additional or substituted collateral for payment
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any release or subordination of any collateral
held at any time by Lender as security for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations; or

       (h)    any resort to Guarantor for payment of all or any portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not Lender shall have resorted to any
collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations, if any, or shall have proceeded
to pursue or exhaust its remedies against Borrower (or any other Person)
primarily or secondarily liable for the Guaranteed Obligations.

No exercise, delay in exercise or non-exercise by Lender of any right hereby
given it, no dealing by Lender with Borrower, Guarantor or any other Person, no
change, impairment or suspension

                                       S-2

<PAGE>

of any right or remedy of Lender, and no act or thing which, but for this
provision, could act as a release or exoneration of the liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder, shall in any way affect, decrease, diminish or impair any of the
obligations of Guarantor hereunder or give Guarantor or any other Person any
recourse or defense against Lender.

       Section 5.    Waiver. Guarantor unconditionally waives the following:

       (a)    notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any of the
matters referred to in Section 4 hereof;

       (b)    all notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or
otherwise to preserve intact any rights which Lender may have against Guarantor
under this Guaranty, including, without limitation, any demand, proof or notice
of non-payment of any of the principal of, interest on or other amounts payable
under the Loan Documents, and notice of any failure on the part of Borrower to
perform and comply with any covenant, agreement, term or condition of the Loan
Documents;

       (c)    any right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise of any right,
power or remedy conferred upon Lender in the Loan Documents or otherwise;

       (d)    any requirement that Lender act with diligence in enforcing its
rights under the Loan Documents or this Guaranty;

       (e)    any right to require Lender to proceed against or exhaust its
recourse against Borrower or any security or collateral held by Lender, if any,
at any time for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or to pursue any other
remedy in its power before being entitled to payment from Guarantor under this
Guaranty or before proceeding against Guarantor;

       (f)    any failure by Lender to file or enforce a claim against the
estate (either in administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of
Borrower or any other Person;

       (g)    any defense based upon an election of remedies by Lender which
destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of Guarantor or the right
of Guarantor (after payment of the Guaranteed Obligations) to proceed against
Borrower for reimbursement, or both;

       (h)    any defense based upon any taking, modification or release of any
collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations, if any, or any failure to perfect any
security interest in, or the taking of, or failure to take any other action with
respect to, any collateral securing payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, if
any;

       (i)    any defense based upon the addition, substitution or release, in
whole or in part, of any Person(s), including, without limitation, another
guarantor, primarily or secondarily liable for or in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations;

       (j)    any rights or defenses based upon an offset by Guarantor against
any obligation now or hereafter owed to Guarantor by Borrower; and

                                       S-3

<PAGE>

       (k)    all other notices which may or might be lawfully waived by
Guarantor;

it being the intention hereof that Guarantor shall remain liable as principal,
to the extent set forth in this Guaranty, until the payment and performance in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations, notwithstanding any act, omission or thing
which might otherwise operate as a legal or equitable discharge of Guarantor
other than the payment and performance in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. No
delay by Lender in exercising any rights and/or powers hereunder or in taking
any action to enforce Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
operate as a waiver as to such rights or powers or in any manner prejudice any
and all of Lender's rights and powers hereunder against Guarantor. The intention
of Guarantor under this Guaranty is that, so long as any of the Guaranteed
Obligations remains unsatisfied, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall
not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such
performance. Guarantor agrees that Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not
be affected by any circumstances, whether or not referred to in this Guaranty,
which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.

       Section 6.    Election of Remedies. This Guaranty may be enforced from
time to time, as often as occasion therefor may arise, and without any
requirement that Lender must first pursue or exhaust any remedies available to
it against Borrower under the Loan Documents or against any other Person or
resort to any collateral at any time held by it for performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations, if any, or any other source or means of obtaining
payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

       Section 7.    Representations and Warranties of Guarantor. Guarantor
hereby represents and warrants to the Lender as follows:

       (a)    Due Organization; Qualification. Guarantor is qualified to
transact business and is in good standing in the State in which it is organized
and in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification and/or standing is
necessary to the conduct of its business and where the failure to be so
qualified would adversely affect the validity of, the enforceability of, or the
ability of Guarantor to perform the Guaranteed Obligations.

       (b)    Power and Authority. Guarantor has the requisite power and
authority (i) to own its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted and as contemplated to be conducted in connection with the performance
of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) to execute and deliver this Guaranty and
to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty.

       (c)    Due Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary action and proceedings by or
on behalf of Guarantor, and no further approvals or filings of any kind,
including any approval of or filing with any Governmental Authority, are
required by or on behalf of Guarantor as a condition to the valid execution,
delivery and performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty.

       (d)    Valid and Binding Obligations. This Guaranty has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by Guarantor and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligations of Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except as such

                                       S-4

<PAGE>

enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws or equitable principles affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles or by the
exercise of discretion by any court.

       (e)    Non-contravention: No Liens. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Guaranty, nor the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Guaranty nor the payment or performance of the Guaranteed
Obligations:

       (i)    does or will conflict with or result in any breach or violation of
       any Applicable Law enacted or issued by any Governmental Authority or
       other agency having jurisdiction over Guarantor, any of the Mortgaged
       Properties or any other portion of the Collateral or assets of Guarantor,
       or any judgment or order applicable to Guarantor or to which Guarantor is
       subject;

       (ii)   does or will conflict with or result in any material breach or
       violation of, or constitute a default under, any of the terms, conditions
       or provisions of Guarantor's Organizational Documents, any indenture,
       existing agreement or other instrument to which Guarantor is a party or
       to which Guarantor, any of the Mortgaged Properties or any other portion
       of the Collateral or other assets of Guarantor is subject; or

       (iii)  does or will require the consent or approval of any creditor of
       Guarantor, any Governmental Authority or any other Person except such
       consents or approvals which have already been obtained.

       (f)    Pending Litigation or Other Proceedings. Except as otherwise
disclosed in writing, there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of
Guarantor, written threat of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, at
law or in equity, before any court, board, body or official of any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator which, if decided adversely to Guarantor, would have, or
may reasonably be expected to materially interfere with Guarantor's ability to
perform its obligations under this Guaranty.

       (g)    Solvency. Guarantor is not insolvent and will not be rendered
insolvent by the transaction contemplated by this Guaranty and after giving
effect to such transaction, Guarantor will not be left with an unreasonably
small amount of capital with which to engage in its business or undertakings,
nor will Guarantor have incurred, have intended to incur, or believe that it has
incurred, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. Guarantor
did not receive less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for
incurrence of the Guaranteed Obligations. There (i) is no contemplated, pending
or, to the best of Guarantor's knowledge, threatened bankruptcy, reorganization,
receivership, insolvency or like proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary,
affecting Guarantor and (ii) has been no assertion or exercise of jurisdiction
over Guarantor by any court empowered to exercise bankruptcy powers.

       (h)    No Contractual Defaults. There are no material defaults by
Guarantor or, to the knowledge of Guarantor, by any other Person under any
contract to which Guarantor is a party other than defaults which do not permit
the non-defaulting party to terminate the contract and which do not have, and
are not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on

                                       S-5

<PAGE>

Guarantor. Neither Guarantor nor, to the knowledge of Guarantor, any other
Person, has received notice or has any knowledge of any existing circumstances
in respect of which it could receive any notice of default or breach in respect
of any contracts.

       (i)    Representations True and Correct. The representations and
warranties made by Guarantor in this Guaranty are true, complete and correct as
of the Initial Closing Date and do not contain any untrue statement of material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

       (j)    ERISA. Guarantor is in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable provisions of ERISA and has not incurred any liability to the
PBGC under Title IV of ERISA. None of the assets of Guarantor constitute plan
assets (within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-101)
of any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA.

       (k)    Financial Information. The financial projections relating to
Guarantor and delivered to the Lender on or prior to the date hereof, if any,
were prepared on the basis of assumptions believed by Guarantor, in good faith
at the time of preparation, to be reasonable and Guarantor is not aware of any
fact or information that would lead it to believe that such assumptions are
incorrect or misleading in any material respect; provided, however, that no
representation or warranty is made that any result set forth in such financial
projections shall be achieved. The financial statements of Guarantor which have
been furnished to the Lender are complete and accurate in all material respects
and present fairly the financial condition of Guarantor, as of its date, applied
on a consistent basis, and since the date of the most recent of such financial
statements no event has occurred which would have, or may reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Guarantor, and there has not been any
material transaction entered into by Guarantor other than transactions related
to the business of owning, managing and operating real estate. Guarantor has no
material contingent obligations which are not otherwise disclosed in its most
recent financial statements.

       (1)    Accuracy of Information. No information, statement or report
furnished in writing to the Lender by Guarantor in connection with this Guaranty
or any other Loan Document or in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby contains any material misstatement
of fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

       (m)    No Conflicts of Interest. To the best knowledge of Guarantor, no
member, officer, agent or employee of the Lender has been or is in any manner
interested, directly or indirectly, in that Person's own name, or in the name of
any other Person, in the Guaranty, the Loan Documents, or any Mortgaged
Property, in any contract for property or materials to be furnished or used in
connection with such Mortgaged Property or in any aspect of the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                                       S-6

<PAGE>

       (n)    Governmental Approvals. To the best of Guarantor's knowledge, no
Governmental Approval not already obtained or made is required for the execution
and delivery of this Guaranty or the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by Guarantor.

       (o)    Governmental Orders. Guarantor is not presently under any cease or
desist order or other orders of a similar nature, temporary or permanent, of any
Governmental Authority which would have the effect of preventing or hindering
performance of its duties hereunder, nor are there any proceedings presently in
progress or to its knowledge contemplated which would, if successful, lead to
the issuance of any such order.

       (p)    No Reliance. Guarantor acknowledges, represents and warrants that
it understands the nature and structure of the transactions contemplated by this
Guaranty and the other Loan Documents; that it is familiar with the provisions
of all of the documents and instruments relating to such transactions; that it
understands the risks inherent in such transactions, including the risk of loss
of all or any of the Mortgaged Properties; and that it has not relied on the
Lender or Fannie Mae for any guidance or expertise in analyzing the financial or
other consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty or any
other Loan Document or otherwise relied on the Lender or Fannie Mae in any
manner in connection with interpreting, entering into or otherwise in connection
with this Guaranty, any other Loan Document or any of the matters contemplated
hereby or thereby.

       (q)    Compliance with Applicable Law. Guarantor is in compliance with
Applicable Law, including all Governmental Approvals, if any, except for such
items of noncompliance that, singly or in the aggregate, have not had and are
not reasonably expected to cause, a Material Adverse Effect on Guarantor.

       (r)    Contracts with Affiliates. Except as set forth on Schedule 1
hereto, Guarantor has not entered into and is not a party to any contract, lease
or other agreement with any Affiliate of Guarantor for the provision of any
service, materials or supplies relating to any Mortgaged Property.

       Section 8.    Affirmative Covenants of Guarantor. Guarantor agrees and
covenants with the Lender that, at all times during the Term of this Guaranty:

       (a)    Maintenance of Existence. Guarantor shall maintain its existence

       examination of its financial statements made by such accountants (except
       for reports otherwise provided pursuant to subsection (a) above).

       (ii)   Other Reports. Promptly upon receipt thereof, all schedules,
       financial statements or other similar reports delivered by the Guarantor
       pursuant to the Loan Documents or reasonably requested by the Lender with
       respect to the Guarantor's business affairs or condition (financial or
       otherwise).

       (c)    Maintain Licenses. Guarantor shall procure and maintain in full
force and effect all licenses, Permits, charters and registrations which are

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to an Event of Default or Potential Event
of Default, all inspections shall be conducted at reasonable times during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice to the Guarantors.

       (e)    Inform the Lender of Material Events. Guarantor shall promptly,

any of the following (and shall deliver to the Lender copies of any related
written communications, complaints, orders, judgments and other documents
relating to the following) of which Guarantor has actual knowledge:

       (i)    Defaults. The occurrence of any Event of Default or any Potential
       Event of Default under any Loan Document;

                                       S-8

<PAGE>

       (ii)   Bankruptcy Proceedings. The commencement of any proceedings by or

reasonably necessary, desirable or proper to carry out more effectively the
purposes of this Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents or to subject the

interests intended by the terms of the Loan Documents or in order to exercise or
enforce its rights under the Loan Documents.

incurring any liability beyond the Guaranteed Obligations, from time to time,
Guarantor shall promptly provide to the Lender such documents, certificates and

fees and disbursements of legal counsel, incurred by or on behalf of Lender in
connection with the enforcement of Guarantor's

                                       S-9

<PAGE>

obligations under this Guaranty or the protection of Lender's rights under this
Guaranty. The covenants contained in this Section shall survive the payment of
the Guaranteed Obligations.

       Section 11.   Condition of Borrower. Guarantor is fully aware of the
financial condition of Borrower and is executing and delivering this Guaranty
based solely upon Guarantor's own independent investigation of all matters
pertinent hereto and is not relying in any manner upon any representation or
statement made by Lender. Guarantor represents and warrants that Guarantor is in
a position to obtain, and Guarantor hereby assumes full responsibility for
obtaining, any additional information concerning Borrower's financial condition
and any other matters pertinent hereto as Guarantor may desire and Guarantor is
not relying upon or expecting Lender to furnish to Guarantor any information now
or hereafter in Lender's possession concerning the same or any other matter. By
executing this Guaranty, Guarantor knowingly accepts the full range of risks
encompassed within a contract of this type, which risks Guarantor acknowledges.

       Section 12.   Further Assurances. Guarantor agrees at any time and from
time to time upon request by Lender to take, or cause to be taken, any action
and to execute and deliver any additional documents which, in the reasonable
opinion of Lender, may be necessary in order to assure to Lender the full
benefits of this Guaranty.

       Section 13.   Subordination. Guarantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that any claims, direct or indirect, Guarantor may have
by subrogation or other form of reimbursement, against Borrower or to any
security or any interest therein, by virtue of this Guaranty or as a consequence
of any payment made by Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty, shall be fully
subordinated in time and right of payment to the payment in full of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other obligations of Guarantor to Lender under
this Guaranty.

       Section 14.   No Subrogation. Guarantor shall not have any right of
subrogation against Borrower by reason of any payment by Guarantor under this
Guaranty until such time as all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been
satisfied in full. Nothing in the foregoing shall affect any claim which any
Guarantor has against Borrower under the terms of the Organizational Documents
of the Borrower.

       Section 15.   Insolvency and Liability of Borrower. So long as any of the
Guaranteed Obligations is unpaid and this Guaranty is in effect, and to the
extent not prohibited by the applicable bankruptcy court, Guarantor agrees to
file all claims against Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which
the filing of claims is required by law in connection with indebtedness owed by
Borrower to Guarantor and to assign to Lender all rights of Guarantor thereunder
up to the lesser of (i) the amount of such indebtedness or (ii) the amount of
the Guaranteed Obligations. In all such cases the Person or Persons authorized
to pay such claims shall pay to Lender the full amount thereof to the full
extent necessary to pay the Guaranteed Obligations, and Guarantor hereby assigns
to Lender all of Guarantor's rights to all such payments to which Guarantor
would otherwise be entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except to the
extent that any sums owed by Borrower to Lender under the Loan Documents shall
have been fully satisfied thereby, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall in
no way be affected by

                                      S-10

<PAGE>

       (a)    the release or discharge of Borrower in any creditors',
receivership, bankruptcy or other proceedings; or

       (b)    the impairment, limitation or modification of the liability of
Borrower or the estate of Borrower in bankruptcy resulting from the operation of
any present or future provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other statute or from
the decision in any court.

       Section 16.   Preferences, Fraudulent Conveyances, Etc. If Lender is
required to refund, or voluntarily refunds, any payment received from Borrower
because such payment is or may be avoided, invalidated, declared fraudulent, set
aside or determined to be void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent
conveyance, impermissible setoff or a diversion of trust funds under the
bankruptcy laws or for any similar reason, including, without limitation, any
judgment, order or decree of any court or administrative body having
jurisdiction over Lender or any of its property, or any settlement or compromise
of any claim effected by Lender with Borrower or other claimant (a "Rescinded
Payment"), then Guarantor's liability to Lender shall continue in full force and
effect, or Guarantor's liability to Lender shall be reinstated, as the case may
be, with the same effect and to the same extent as if the Rescinded Payment had
not been received by Lender, notwithstanding the cancellation or termination of
any Note or any of the other Loan Documents. In addition, Guarantor shall pay,
or reimburse Lender for, all expenses (including all reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs and related disbursements) incurred by Lender in the defense of any
claim that a payment received by Lender in respect of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations from Guarantor must be refunded. The provisions of this
Section shall survive the termination of this Guaranty and any satisfaction and
discharge of Borrower by virtue of any payment, court order or any federal or
state law.

       Section 17.   Waiver. Neither this Guaranty nor any term hereof may be
changed, waived, discharged or terminated except by an instrument in writing
signed by Lender and Guarantor expressly referring to this Guaranty and to the
provisions so changed or limited. No such waiver shall extend to or affect any
obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No
course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any
right under this Guaranty shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise by
prejudice thereto.

       Section 18.   Notices. All notices or other communications hereunder
shall be sufficiently given and shall be deemed given when sent in the manner

If to Lender or Fannie Mae:

       As provided in the Master Agreement.

       Section 19.   Assignability by Lender. Lender may, without notice to
Guarantor, assign or transfer the Advances and the Loan Documents, in whole or
in part. In such event, each and every immediate and successive assignee,
transferee or holder of all or any part of the Advances and the Loan Documents
shall have the right to enforce this Guaranty, by legal action or otherwise, as
fully as if such assignee, transferee, or holder were by name specifically given
such right and power in this Guaranty. Lender shall have an unimpaired right to
enforce this Guaranty for its benefit as to so much of the Advances and the Loan
Documents as Lender has not sold, assigned or transferred.

       Section 20.   Guarantor Bound by Judgment Against Borrower. Guarantor
shall be conclusively bound, in any jurisdiction, by the judgment in any action
by Lender against Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents (wherever
instituted) as if Guarantor were a party to such action even if not so joined as
a party.

       Section 21.   Governing Law. The provisions of Section 17.06 of the
Master Agreement (entitled Choice of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial) are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference to the
fullest extent as if the text of such Section were set forth in its entirety
herein.

       Section 22.   Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Guaranty or
the application thereof to Guarantor or any circumstance in any jurisdiction
whose laws govern this Guaranty shall, to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable under any applicable statute, regulation or rule of law, then such
provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability and shall be deemed modified to conform to such statute,
regulation or rule or law. The remainder of this Guaranty and the application of
any such invalid or unenforceable provision to parties, jurisdictions or
circumstances other than those to whom or to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability nor
shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability
of any other provision of this Guaranty.

       Section 23.   General Provisions. This Guaranty shall be binding upon the
respective successors and assigns of Guarantor, and shall inure to the benefit
of Lender and its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, each
successive holder of the Notes. The descriptive headings of the Sections of the
Guaranty have been inserted herein for convenience of reference only and shall
not define or limit the provisions hereof.

       Section 24.   Obligations Joint and Several. The obligations of Guarantor
hereunder shall be joint and several with the obligations of any other
guarantors under this and any other guaranty and the obligations of the Borrower
under the Loan Documents.

affect the validity of, the enforceability of, or the ability of the Borrower to
perform the Obligations under the Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Borrower is qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each State
in which it owns a Mortgaged Property.

              (b)    Borrower's principal place of business, principal
office and office where it keeps its books and records as to the Collateral is
located at the address set out in Section 17.08 of the Agreement.

       4.     Power and Authority. Borrower has the requisite power and
authority (a) to own its properties and to carry on their business as now
conducted and as contemplated to be conducted in connection with the performance
of the Obligations under the Agreement and under the other Loan Documents to
which it is a party and (b) to execute and deliver the Agreement

and the other Loan Documents and to carry out the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party.

       5.     Due Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party have been duly
authorized by all necessary action and proceedings by or on behalf of Borrower,
and no further approvals or filings of any kind, including any approval of or
filing with any Governmental Authority, are required by or on behalf of Borrower
as a condition to the valid execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of
the Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party.

       6.     Valid and Binding Obligations. The Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which it is a party have been duly executed and delivered by
Borrower and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower,
enforceable against Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws or equitable principles affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles or by the
exercise of discretion by any court.

       7.     Single-Purpose Status. Except as otherwise expressly approved by
Fannie Mae in writing, the Borrower is a Single-Purpose entity and does not own
any real property or assets other than the Mortgaged Properties and does not
operate any business other than the management and operation of the Mortgaged
Properties.

       8.     No Default. The execution, delivery and performance of the
obligations imposed on Borrower under the Loan Documents to which it is a party
and the Security Documents will not cause Borrower to be in default under the
provisions of any agreement, judgment or order to which Borrower is a party or
by which Borrower is bound.

       9.     Financial Statements. The financial statements of Borrower and any
managing member of Borrower furnished to Lender, are, in each case, complete and
accurate in all material respects and present fairly the financial condition of
such entities or persons, as of its date in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis.

       10.    Financial Condition. No material adverse change in the financial
condition of Borrower or any managing member of Borrower has occurred between
the respective dates of the financial statements which were furnished to Lender
relating to such entities or persons and the date hereof.

       11.    No Insolvency or Judgment. Neither Borrower, nor any managing
member of Borrower is currently (a) the subject of or a party to any completed
or pending bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding; or (b) the
subject of any judgment unsatisfied of record or docketed in any court of the
state in which any Mortgaged Property is located or in any court located in the
United States.

       12.    Taxes Paid. Borrower has filed all federal, state, county and
municipal tax returns required to have been filed by Borrower, and has paid all
taxes which have become due pursuant to such returns or to any notice of
assessment received by Borrower, and Borrower has no

                                       T-2

<PAGE>

knowledge of any basis for additional assessment with respect to such taxes. To
the best of Borrower's knowledge, there are not presently pending any special
assessments against any Mortgaged Property or any part thereof.

       13.    ERISA. Borrower is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable provisions of ERISA and has not incurred any liability to the PBGC
under Title IV of ERISA. None of the assets of Borrower constitute plan assets
(within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-101) of any
employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA.

       14.    Governmental Approvals; Governmental Orders. No Governmental
Approval not already obtained or made is required for the execution and delivery
of the Agreement or any other Loan Document or the performance of the terms and
provisions thereof by the Borrower. Borrower is not presently under any cease or
desist order or other orders of a similar nature, temporary or permanent, of any
Governmental Authority which would have the effect of preventing or hindering
performance of the terms and provisions of the Agreement or any other Loan
Document, nor are there any proceedings presently in progress or to its
knowledge contemplated which would, if successful, lead to the issuance of any
such order.

       15.    Impositions. Borrower has paid all of the following items which
have become due and payable regarding any Mortgaged Property: taxes, government
assessments; insurance premiums; water, sewer and municipal charges; leasehold
payments; ground rents; all parties furnishing labor and materials and, except
for such liens or claims insured against by the policy of title insurance to be
issued in connection with the Credit Facility, there are no mechanics',
laborers' or materialmen's liens or claims outstanding for work, labor or
materials affecting any Mortgaged Property, whether prior to, equal with or
subordinate to the lien of any Security Instrument; and any other charges
affecting any Mortgaged Property.

       16.    Compliance with Applicable Laws. Each Mortgaged Property complies
in all material respects with all Applicable Laws affecting such Mortgaged
Property. Without limiting the foregoing, all material Permits, including
certificates of occupancy, to the extent issued by the relevant jurisdiction,
have been issued and are in full force and effect. Neither Borrower nor, to the
knowledge of Borrower, any former owner of any Mortgaged Property, has received
any written notification or threat of any actions or proceedings regarding the
noncompliance or nonconformity of any Mortgaged Property with any Applicable
Laws or Permits, which noncompliance or nonconformity would have a material
adverse effect on the relevant Mortgaged Property, nor is Borrower otherwise
aware of any such pending actions or proceedings.

       17.    Leases.

              (a)    Borrower has delivered to Lender a true and correct copy
of the form apartment lease for each Mortgaged Property (and, with respect to
leases executed prior to the date on which Borrower first owned the Mortgaged
Property, the form apartment lease used for such leases). Except as set forth in
a Rent Roll, no Lease for any unit in any Mortgaged Property (i) is for a term
in excess of one year, including any renewal or extension period unless such
renewal or extension period is subject to termination by the Borrower Parties
upon not more than

                                       T-3

<PAGE>

30 days' written notice, (ii) provides for prepayment of more than one month's
rent, or (iii) was entered into in other than the ordinary course of business.

              (b)    Except for any assignment of leases and rents which is a
Permitted Lien or which is to be released in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, Borrower is the owner and holder
of the landlord's interest under each of the Leases and there are no prior
outstanding assignments of any such Lease, or any portion of the rents,
additional rents, charges, issues or profits due and payable or to become due
and payable thereunder.

              (c)    Each Lease constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Borrower and, to the knowledge of Borrower, of each of the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject only to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to
creditors' rights generally, and equitable principles, and except as disclosed
in writing to the Lender, no notice of any default by Borrower which remains
uncured has been sent by any tenant under any such Lease, other than defaults
which do not have, and are not reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Mortgaged Property subject to the Lease.

              (d)    All premises demised to tenants under Leases are occupied
by such tenants as tenants only. No Lease contains any option or right to
purchase, right of first refusal or any other similar provisions.

       18.    Condition of the Mortgaged Properties. Except as disclosed in any
third party report delivered to Lender prior to the date on which any Mortgaged
Property is added to the Collateral Pool, or otherwise disclosed in writing by
Borrower to Lender prior to such date, each Mortgaged Property is in good
condition, order and repair, there exist no structural or other material defects
in such Mortgaged Property (whether patent or, to the best knowledge of
Borrower, latent or otherwise) and Borrower has not received notice from any
insurance company or bonding company of any defects or inadequacies in such
Mortgaged Property, or any part of it, which would adversely affect the
insurability of such Mortgaged Property or cause the imposition of extraordinary
premiums or charges for insurance or of any termination or threatened
termination of any policy of insurance or bond. No claims have been made against
any contractor, architect or other party with respect to the condition of any
Mortgaged Property or the existence of any structural or other material defect
therein. No Mortgaged Property has been materially damaged by casualty which has
not been fully repaired or for which insurance proceeds have not been received
or are not expected to be received except as previously disclosed in writing to
Lender. There are no proceedings pending for partial or total condemnation of
any Mortgaged Property except as disclosed in writing to Lender.

       19.    Representations and Warranties True. Each and every representation
and warranty contained herein will remain true and correct at all times from the
date hereof until all Obligations have been performed in full in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents and the Security Documents. In the event that
any representation or warranty contained herein becomes untrue, in whole or in
part, after the date hereof, Borrower will so advise Lender and Fannie Mae in
writing immediately.

Loan Documents, regardless of any investigation made by Lender or Fannie Mae.
