occur after the date hereof and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance shall
be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurocurrency
Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on

All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any
Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending
Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in

the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Administrative Agent may,

the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.20 shall govern and control over every other provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section&nbsp;2.20,
even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section&nbsp;2.20, the term

constitute interest under applicable law, <I>provided </I>that, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a)&nbsp;any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as
compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as
interest, and (b)&nbsp;all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of the Obligations.
In no event shall the Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Lender have any
right or privilege to reserve, receive or retain, (a)&nbsp;any interest in excess of the maximum amount
of nonusurious interest permitted under the applicable laws (if any) of the United States or of any
applicable state, or (b)&nbsp;total interest in excess of the amount which such Lender could lawfully
have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for
the full term of the Obligations at the Highest Lawful Rate. On each day, if any, that the
interest rate (the &#147;Stated Rate&#148;) called for under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be
fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed
at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued
equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as
is imposed by this sentence. Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until
the Stated Rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately

daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be

in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest
shall ever be construed without reference to this Section&nbsp;2.20, or be construed to create a
contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the
Highest Lawful Rate. If the term of any Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of
maturity as a result of any Event of Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or
permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Lender at any time, including but

Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that
its operations are not in material compliance with any of the requirements of applicable

assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each
Lender, (ii)&nbsp;any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section&nbsp;12.3, and (iii)
any transfer by Participation must be made in compliance with Section&nbsp;12.2. Any attempted
assignment or transfer by any party not made in compliance with this Section&nbsp;12.1 shall be null and

the terms of this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii)&nbsp;of this

Federal Reserve Bank or (y)&nbsp;in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its

security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and
until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of Section&nbsp;12.3. The Administrative
Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section&nbsp;12.3; <I>provided, however</I>, that
the Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions
from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such
Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by
acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.
Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving
such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been
issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee
of the rights to such Loan.

Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided further that the Borrower shall be

notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after having received
notice thereof. The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an

(ii)&nbsp;payment of a $3,500 fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment
(unless such fee is waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become
effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain
a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make
the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable
assignment agreement constitutes &#147;plan assets&#148; as defined under ERISA and that the rights
and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be &#147;plan assets&#148;
under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for
all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or
on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the
Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the
transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit
Exposure assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrower,
the Lenders or the Administrative Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the
assigning Lender&#146;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to,
those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the
Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section
12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section&nbsp;12.2. Upon the
consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12.3.3, the
transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender
or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements
so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender
and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each
case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to
such assignment.

continue. If at any time the Borrower has no Moody&#146;s Rating or no S&#038;P Rating, Level V Status shall

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am counsel for ProAssurance Corporation (the &#147;Borrower&#148;), and have represented the Borrower
in connection with its execution and delivery of a Credit Agreement dated as of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (the
&#147;Agreement&#148;) among the Borrower, the Lenders named therein, and U.S. Bank National Association, as

exceeding $150,000,000 at any one time outstanding. All capitalized terms used in this opinion and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement or in the
Security Agreement (as defined in the Agreement).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have examined the Borrower&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation under the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, the Third Restatement of the By-Laws of the Borrower, applicable
resolutions of the Borrower&#146;s Board of Directors, the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact

our opinion that:

and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted and to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance by
the Borrower of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate
proceedings on the part of the Borrower and will not:

legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance
with their terms except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights generally and subject
also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable remedies are sought.

Adverse Effect.

of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;The provisions of the Security Agreement are effective to create in favor of the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations, a valid security
interest in the Borrower&#146;s rights in the Collateral which is of a type in which a security interest
can be created pursuant to Article&nbsp;9 of the Delaware UCC (the &#147;Article&nbsp;9 Collateral&#148;) as security
for the Secured Obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;The provisions of the Securities Account Control Agreement are effective to give the
Administrative Agent &#147;control&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;8-106 of the Delaware UCC) over each
&#091;Securities Account&#093; (as defined in the Securities Account Control Agreement) and each &#147;security
entitlement&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;8-102(a)(17) of the Delaware UCC) credited thereto, and no
other action need be taken in order to perfect the Administrative Agent&#146;s security interest in such
&#091;Securities Accounts&#093; or security entitlements, which perfected security interest will be prior to
any security interest in any such &#091;Securities Account&#093; or security entitlement that is created by
the Borrower in favor of any other secured party under the Delaware UCC.
