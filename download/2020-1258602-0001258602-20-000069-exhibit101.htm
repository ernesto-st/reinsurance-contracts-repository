<DIV style="font-size:xx-small;color:white;width:1500px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS Participation Agreement &nbsp;&nbsp;shall represent a participation interest in each of the individual SLABS &nbsp;&nbsp;specifically identified in the participation certificate with respect thereto; &nbsp;&nbsp;UBATCO is not purchasing an interest in any fungible group of SLABS. The &nbsp;&nbsp;purchase price shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds from &nbsp;&nbsp;UBATCO to Nelnet. Unless UBATCO gives prior written consent, any portion of &nbsp;&nbsp;the SLABS in respect of Eligible Loans pledged as collateral to secure payment of &nbsp;&nbsp;the SLABS, which is not guaranteed under the risk sharing provisions of the Act, &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be retained by Nelnet and shall not be participated to UBATCO hereunder. It &nbsp;&nbsp;is acknowledged that UBATCO will not purchase any participation interest in its &nbsp;&nbsp;own right, but rather only in its capacity as trustee on behalf of various grantor &nbsp;&nbsp;trusts. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. The sale and purchase of SLABS participations under this &nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement shall be without recourse against Nelnet. Nelnet and UBATCO &nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledge and agree that this Agreement results in a pro rata sharing of credit &nbsp;&nbsp;risk proportionate to the respective interests of Nelnet and UBATCO in the &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS, both before and after any defaults with respect to such SLABS or the &nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible Loans pledged as collateral to secure payment of the SLABS.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1.02. Participation Certificates. On the date of the first sale of a participation &nbsp;&nbsp;interest with respect to a portfolio of SLABS, or thereafter as mutually agreed to by the parties, &nbsp;&nbsp;Nelnet shall execute and deliver (or shall cause to be executed and delivered) to UBATCO a &nbsp;&nbsp;participation certificate substantially in the form marked as Exhibit &#8220;A,&#8221; attached hereto and &nbsp;&nbsp;incorporated herein by this reference, evidencing a participating equitable ownership interest in &nbsp;&nbsp;the SLABS in that particular portfolio. Nelnet shall deliver or cause to be delivered to UBATCO &nbsp;&nbsp;in addition to the executed original of Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221; a schedule of the securities identifying such &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS comprising the portfolio, title to which shall be retained by or on behalf of Nelnet. As &nbsp;&nbsp;Nelnet sells additional participation interests in SLABS to UBATCO, additional schedules &nbsp;&nbsp;identifying participated SLABS shall be issued accordingly. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1.03. Distribution of Payments Received. Upon transfer of a participation &nbsp;&nbsp;interest with respect to particular portfolio SLABS, UBATCO shall be entitled to one hundred &nbsp;&nbsp;percent (100%) of payments and income received with respect to the participated portion of the &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS contained in such participation certificate, less a fee (&#8220;Nelnet&#8217;s Fee&#8221;) deducted and paid &nbsp;&nbsp;to Nelnet equal to the difference between (i) the total of interest or other income received with &nbsp;&nbsp;respect to such SLABS contained in a participation certificate, less (ii) the amount equal to the &nbsp;&nbsp;product of (A) the annualized rate of 70 basis points (0.70%) over the one month London &nbsp;&nbsp;Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), multiplied by (B) the average quarterly aggregate outstanding &nbsp;&nbsp;the participated portion of principal balances of the SLABS contained in the participation &nbsp;&nbsp;certificate. Nelnet shall pay for all administration costs, all servicing costs incurred by its &nbsp;&nbsp;servicing agent (&#8220;Servicer&#8221;) and any other costs incidental to or associated with ownership, &nbsp;&nbsp;administration, servicing, and collection of the SLABS; all such costs shall be deducted from and &nbsp;&nbsp;paid from Nelnet&#8217;s Fee. Nelnet&#8217;s Fee shall be payable to Nelnet on a quarterly basis. Nelnet &nbsp;&nbsp;agrees to account and deliver to UBATCO, all sums of principal, interest other income received &nbsp;&nbsp;by Nelnet on account of the SLABS during the term of the participation certificates. Nelnet shall &nbsp;&nbsp;forward such payments of UBATCO&#8217;s portion of income as are due to UBATCO in accordance &nbsp;&nbsp;with the terms of this Agreement no less frequently than on a quarterly basis, or as otherwise &nbsp;&nbsp;DocuSign Envelope ID: 6BACE3D7-C8B4-48BB-A941-13A02CCE2080&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

Possession and Control of the SLABS. Nelnet shall cause all of the &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS to be administered, serviced and collected in accordance with the requirements of the &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS and applicable laws and regulations.

The term of this Agreement shall be 364 days from the date of execution &nbsp;&nbsp;of this Agreement. The term of this Agreement or any portions thereof, may be terminated earlier &nbsp;&nbsp;by UBATCO or Nelnet upon five (5) business days prior notice to the other party. This &nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement shall automatically renew for successive 364-day terms, without necessity of any &nbsp;&nbsp;further documentation, unless either party hereto gives notice to the other party of intent to &nbsp;&nbsp;terminate at the end of the then current term or renewal. Upon termination of the participation &nbsp;&nbsp;certificate, Nelnet shall have the option, without the obligation, to purchase back from UBATCO &nbsp;&nbsp;the participation interest in the SLABS comprising the terminated participation certificate for a &nbsp;&nbsp;purchase price equal the product of the purchase price percentage (as determined from the &nbsp;&nbsp;original purchase of the participation interest in Section 1.01(A) hereof), multiplied by the &nbsp;&nbsp;aggregate of the full unpaid principal balances and accrued and unpaid interest thereon of the &nbsp;&nbsp;participated portion of all the SLABS covered in the terminated participation certificate. In order &nbsp;&nbsp;to exercise such option to purchase, Nelnet must give written notice to UBATCO at least three &nbsp;&nbsp;days prior to termination of the participation certificate; if the option is exercised, such purchase &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be closed upon the termination of the participation certificate. In the event Nelnet does not &nbsp;&nbsp;exercise its option to purchase SLABS contained in any participation certificate, upon the &nbsp;&nbsp;termination of the participation certificate, Nelnet shall immediately transfer or cause its &nbsp;&nbsp;custodian to transfer to UBATCO or its designee legal title and any unparticipated beneficial &nbsp;&nbsp;interest to the underlying SLABS comprising the participation certificate, or Nelnet&#8217;s &nbsp;&nbsp;participation interest therein, and Nelnet shall immediately deliver or cause its custodian to &nbsp;&nbsp;deliver to UBATCO an executed bill of sale, possession of the promissory notes, bonds and &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS files, all payments and income yielded from the underlying SLABS, and other &nbsp;&nbsp;documentation reasonably required by UBATCO and acceptable in form to UBATCO which is &nbsp;&nbsp;effective to transfer all of Nelnet&#8217;s right, title and interest in and to such underlying SLABS or &nbsp;&nbsp;Nelnet&#8217;s participation interest therein, to UBATCO, free and clear of any lien or encumbrances &nbsp;&nbsp;of any nature and without payment of further consideration; UBATCO shall pay to Nelnet any &nbsp;&nbsp;outstanding principal and interest representing previously unparticipated portions of such &nbsp;&nbsp;SLABS. If Nelnet exercises its option to purchase the participated SLABS as permitted above, &nbsp;&nbsp;Nelnet may deal in the same as it deems proper. The parties agree that this Agreement has not &nbsp;&nbsp;been undertaken for the purpose of recognizing gains or decreasing losses resulting from market &nbsp;&nbsp;value changes in the SLABS.  In the event Nelnet sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of any &nbsp;&nbsp;of the SLABS participated hereunder or interests therein to any third party, UBATCO shall not &nbsp;&nbsp;be entitled to receive or share in any gain recognized upon such sale or any portion thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; V. MISCELLANEOUS &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5.01. Assignment. The rights of UBATCO under this Agreement are assignable &nbsp;&nbsp;or may be sub-participated, pledged, exchanged or otherwise disposed of in whole or in part, &nbsp;&nbsp;without the prior written consent of Nelnet, but any such disposition shall be solely to &nbsp;&nbsp;beneficiaries of the grantor trusts for which UBATCO serves as trustee on or after the date of &nbsp;&nbsp;this Agreement. The rights and obligations of Nelnet under this Agreement may not be assigned &nbsp;&nbsp;in whole or in part without the prior written consent of UBATCO.
