thereto, then within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of receipt by
Purchaser of the Post Closing Equity Schedule, Purchaser shall provide written
notice thereof to PLC stating any such objection and the basis for such
objection. If Purchaser does not timely deliver a notice of objection to PLC,

than the Estimated Stock Price, then Sellers shall pay the amount of such
difference to Purchaser in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within ten (10) calendar days after the lapse of the 60-day notice period, and
(ii)&#160;if the Stock Price shown on the Post Closing Equity Schedule is
greater than the Estimated Stock Price, Purchaser shall pay the amount of such
difference to PLICO in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within ten (10) calendar days after the lapse of the 60-day notice period (such
increase or decrease to the Estimated Stock Price, as the case may be, being the
&#147;Adjustment Amount&#148;). Payment of the amount pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) immediately above, if any, will be accompanied by the payment of interest

timely deliver a notice of objection to PLC pursuant to clause (b) above,
Purchaser and PLC shall undertake to negotiate in good faith in order to resolve
the amount so disputed. If Purchaser and PLC are unable to resolve the dispute
within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of PLC&#146;s receipt of the
notice of objection, then the issues remaining in dispute will be submitted to a
panel of three (3) accountants (the &#147;Resolving Accountants&#148;), each of
whom has substantial experience in the life and health insurance industry and
with whom neither Purchaser nor PLC has had a business relationship during the
two (2) years prior to the Closing Date. Not more than one of such Resolving
Accountants may be from the same accounting firm. One of such Resolving
Accountants shall be selected by PLC, one of such Resolving Accountants shall be
selected by Purchaser, and the third Resolving Accountant shall be mutually
selected by the two Resolving Accountants selected by PLC and Purchaser. If
issues in dispute are submitted to the Resolving Accountants, each of PLC and
Purchaser will furnish to the Resolving Accountants such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Resolving
Accountants may request and are available, and each of PLC and Purchaser will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Resolving Accountants any material
relating to the determination and to discuss the determination with the
Resolving Accountants, and copies of such material shall be provided to the
other party at the same time. The determination by the Resolving Accountants, as
set forth in a written notice delivered to Purchaser and PLC by the Resolving
Accountants, will be in accordance with the standards set forth in items (i)
through (iv) of Section 3.4(a), consistent with the terms of this Agreement
including the adjustments provided for herein. The determination by the
Resolving Accountants will be binding and conclusive on Fortis, Purchaser and
Sellers, and Purchaser and Sellers will each bear the fees of the Resolving
Accountants for such determination based upon the Resolving Accountants&#146;
determination of the extent to which each of PLC and Purchaser was correct or
incorrect as to the dispute. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;binding and
conclusive&#148; shall mean that the aforesaid determinations shall have the
same preclusive effect for all purposes as if such determinations had been
embodied in a final judgment, no longer subject to appeal, entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Upon resolution of such
dispute as contemplated by clause (c) above, whether by agreement between
Purchaser and PLC or by determination of the Resolving Accountants, (i)&#160;if
the Stock Price shown on such resolved Post Closing Equity Schedule is less than
the Estimated Stock Price, then Sellers shall pay the amount of such difference
to Purchaser in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten

Price shown on such resolved Post Closing Equity Schedule is more than the
Estimated Stock Price, then Purchaser shall pay the amount of such difference to
PLICO in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10)
calendar days of the resolution of the dispute. Payment of the amount pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) immediately above, if any, will be accompanied by the
payment of interest thereon from the Closing Date to and including the date of

<h3 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.5       <u>True-Up Accounting.</u></h3>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Within sixty (60)
calendar days following the one year anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser
will prepare and deliver to PLC a final accounting consisting only of the
True-Up Items as of the Closing Date, in substantially the same form as the Post
Closing Equity Schedule (the &#147;<u>True-Up Reserve Accounting</u>&#148;). The
True-Up Reserve Accounting will include a statement comparing the values of the
items set forth on the True-Up Reserve Accounting with the values of such items
on the Post Closing Equity Schedule and compute the differences in such values.
With respect to the A&amp;H Claim Reserves that have been estimated, the True-Up
Reserve Accounting will restate the liability for claims that were incurred
before the Closing Date but not reported as of the Closing Date by replacing the
estimated liability for such claims that was included in the Post Closing Equity
Schedule with the sum of (i) the actual runoff of such claims that were incurred
before the Closing Date and that have been paid since the Closing Date, plus
(ii) an estimate for any such claims that were incurred before the Closing Date
and may be unpaid as of the date that is one year after the Closing Date. To the
extent that the actual amounts relating to the A&amp;H Premiums Due and Deferred
as of the Closing Date become determinable prior to the preparation of the
True-Up Reserve Accounting, such items shall be reflected on the True-Up Reserve
Accounting as actual amounts rather than estimations. The True-Up Reserve
Accounting will be accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer
of Purchaser, certifying that to his or her knowledge, the True-Up Reserve
Accounting is: (i) correct and does not contain errors in calculation,
methodology or application; (ii) is based on the books and records of the
Companies; (iii) is prepared in accordance with Modified GAAP using accounting
and actuarial principles, practices and methodologies consistent with the
applicable Company&#146;s December 31, 2000 GAAP balance sheet; and (iv) is
prepared consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the adjustments
provided for herein. PLC shall be provided with reasonable access to the work
papers (including those of Purchaser&#146;s independent accounting firm, if
applicable), books, records, data, information and personnel of Purchaser and
its Affiliates supporting the True-Up Reserve Accounting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) PLC shall have sixty
(60) calendar days in which to review the True-Up Reserve Accounting and to the
extent that PLC has any objections thereto, then within sixty (60) calendar days
from the date of receipt by PLC of the True-Up Reserve Accounting, PLC shall
provide written notice thereof to Purchaser stating any such objection and the
basis for such objection. If PLC does not timely deliver a notice of objection
to Purchaser: </FONT></P>

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Related
Agreements and any other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby, including

respective counsel the opportunity to review in advance and comment on any
initial filings with any Governmental Entity (other than proprietary or
confidential information filed as part of the HSR Act) provided that the parties
receiving such filing shall respond on a timely basis, and the party preparing

is expressly understood by the parties hereto that each party hereto shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit, to the extent practicable,
representatives of the other party to attend and participate reasonably in any
hearing, proceeding, meeting, conference or similar event before or with a
Governmental Entity relating to this Agreement or a Related Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and Sellers shall provide each other
reasonable advance notice, to the extent practicable, of any such hearing,
proceeding, meeting, conference or similar event. The notice required to be
given under this Section 8.4 shall be given to representatives of Sellers or
Purchaser entitled to receive notices hereunder, to the extent practicable. </FONT></P>

the Related Agreements, including the consents of third parties required under
the Transferred Contracts, the Other Agreements and the Material Contracts,
provided that exercise of commercially reasonable efforts shall not require the
payment of any fee or other economic consideration for any such approval or

extent that, prior to Closing, Sellers are unable to obtain any required
approval or consent of non-governmental authorities to any Contract to be
assigned to Purchaser hereunder, (i)&#160;Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in cooperation with Purchaser after the Closing to
(A)&#160;provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the benefits of any such
agreement or license, (B)&#160;cooperate in any arrangement, reasonable and
lawful as to Sellers and Purchaser, designed to provide such benefits to
Purchaser and (C)&#160;enforce for the account of Purchaser any rights of
Sellers arising from such agreements and licenses, including the right to elect
to terminate any such agreement or license in accordance with the terms thereof
on the advice of Purchaser, and (ii)&#160;Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to perform the obligations of Sellers arising under such

however, Purchaser&#146;s obligations to perform under any such non-assigned

and when any such approval or consent shall be obtained or such agreement or
license shall otherwise become assignable, the applicable Seller shall promptly

amendment or supplement to, the schedules, or to cure any breach or inaccuracy
of a representation or warranty, unless (i) the changes reflected in such
supplemental schedules reflect the addition or subtraction of Material Contracts
or Transferred Contracts resulting from the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and are not matters for which Purchaser&#146;s
prior written consent is required pursuant to Section 8.1, or (ii) are so agreed
to in writing by Purchaser, which agreement shall not waive any of
Purchaser&#146;s rights to indemnification under Article 13; and provided
further, that such supplemental schedules shall not entitle Purchaser to refuse
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby unless such supplemental
schedules, individually or in the aggregate, disclose a failure to satisfy a
condition to Closing specified in Section 10.1. </FONT></P>

<h3 align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.8       <u>Employee Matters.</u></h3>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, offer to employ Business
Employees; provided, however, that, with respect to each &#147;single site of
employment&#148; (as such term is defined in the WARN Act and with all of the
greater Birmingham, Alabama facilities being aggregated for this purpose) of the
Business that has 50 or more Business Employees assigned to it as of the Closing
Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates will offer &#147;Comparable Jobs&#148; (as
such term is defined in Schedule 8.8(c)) to not less than 70% of the Business
Employees who are assigned to each such single site of employment as of the
Closing Date. PLC and PLICO shall, and shall cause UDC-CA to, reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser with respect to the transition of Business Employees.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers shall not, and shall
cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, take any action
specifically designed and intended to influence an individual&#146;s decision to
accept or decline such offer of employment from Purchaser. Each Business
Employee who accepts employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates following the
Closing Date shall be treated as a &#147;Transferred Employee&#148; for purposes
hereof. From and after the Closing Date, subject to Applicable Law, (i)
Purchaser agrees to credit each Transferred Employee with all unused vacation
accumulated with PLC and its subsidiaries before the Closing Date in accordance
with the vacation policy set forth in Schedule 2.3(b), plus any additional
vacation that such Transferred Employee accumulates under Purchaser&#146;s
vacation policy (taking into account the provisions of Section 8.8(b)), and (ii)
Purchaser agrees to pay severance benefits in an amount no less than the
Purchaser Severance Benefits to any Transferred Employee who has an involuntary
termination of employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates other than for cause
within 18 months after the Closing Date. &#147;Purchaser Severance
Benefits&#148; shall mean the benefits determined and paid as set forth in
Schedule 8.8(a). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To the extent that any
employee benefit plan, program or policy of Purchaser is made available to
Transferred Employees on or following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, grant Transferred Employees credit for
all service with PLC and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date for purposes
of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual), to the extent that service
of Purchaser&#146;s or its applicable Affiliate&#146;s employees is recognized
for any such purpose. Such credit of service shall include credit for service
with PLC and its subsidiaries for purposes of vacation, sick pay, paid time off,
employee recognition or length of service rewards, and severance pay, unless
such grant of credit would violate Applicable Law or require Purchaser or its
Affiliates, pursuant to Applicable Law, to increase benefits for its other
employees. Purchaser agrees that where applicable with respect to any medical,
dental, vision or disability benefit plan of Purchaser or its applicable
Affiliate, (i) Purchaser shall waive, with respect to any Transferred Employee,
any pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements (to the
extent such exclusion or requirement would not have applied under the applicable
Business Employee Plan) and (ii) any covered expenses incurred on or before the
Closing Date by a Transferred Employee or a Transferred Employee&#146;s covered
dependents shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing
Date to the same extent as such expenses would be taken into account if incurred
by similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Purchaser agrees to
reimburse PLC and its Affiliates for the cost of the PLC Severance Benefits
provided by PLC or its Affiliates to each Business Employee who both (i) has an
involuntary termination of employment (except as set forth in Schedule 8.8(c))
with PLC and its Affiliates within seven (7) days after the Closing Date as a
direct result of the sale of the Business (other than for such Business
Employees who will be retained by PLC and its Affiliates in order to provide
transition services to Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.16, for whom involuntary
termination shall occur within seven (7) days after such Business
Employee&#146;s services are no longer needed to provided the transition
services described in Section 8.16), and (ii) is not offered a &#147;Comparable
Job&#148; (as defined in Schedule 8.8(c)) by Purchaser. &#147;PLC Severance
Benefits&#148; shall mean the benefits determined and paid as set forth in
Schedule 8.8(c). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Sellers shall be solely
responsible for and retain all liabilities under the Business Employee Plans,
other than the vacation accrual and retention and stay agreements that are
expressly part of the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with Sections 2.3(b) and
2.3(c). PLC shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, take all steps
reasonably necessary to transfer sponsorship of the DentiCare, Inc. 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan and the United Dental Care, Inc. 401(k) Plan and Trust to
PLC prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, PLC shall indemnify, reimburse, defend, and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Companies) from and against any and all Losses incurred by Purchaser or its
Affiliates that are based upon, arise out of, or are otherwise related to any
Business Employee Plan or any other plan described in the first sentence of
Section 5.9(a) that is not listed on Schedule 5.9 because such plan was not
&#147;material&#148;. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Sellers shall cause
each Transferred Employee to be fully vested as of the Closing Date in their
accrued benefit, if any, under all stock bonus, pension or profit sharing plans
of Sellers and their Affiliates that are intended to be qualified under Code
Section 401(a), except to the extent that such vesting would violate Applicable
Law or require Sellers, pursuant to Applicable Law, to increase benefits for
their other employees. Sellers shall also pay, or cause to be paid, to each
Transferred Employee for calendar year 2001 such cash bonuses as Sellers
reasonably determine to be reasonable and appropriate under applicable cash
bonus plans of Sellers and their Affiliates, in consideration of the

substantially similar to those included in the Business, and (v) consult with
each other regarding each party&#146;s development work pertaining to systems,

significant number, substantially all, or all of the Business Employees who are
not offered employment by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser pursuant to
Section 8.8. Purchaser and Sellers agree that for purposes of the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the &#147;WARN Act&#148;), the
Closing Date shall be the &#147;effective date of the sale&#148; as such term is
used in the WARN Act. PLC, PLICO and UDC-CA agree that prior to, on or as of the

WARN Act with respect to the Business Employees and the Companies (including in
connection with the termination by PLC, PLICO and UDC-CA of Business Employees

pursuant to Section 8.8, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless PLC and its
subsidiaries from and against all payments, benefits costs, related expenses
(including attorney&#146;s fees and expenses incurred) and fines which may
become due and payable under the WARN Act because of PLC, PLICO&#146;s and/or
UDC-CA&#146;s termination of Business Employees solely as a direct consequence
of the Business having been sold to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and
Purchaser not having made offers of Comparable Jobs to the Business Employees,

obligations that arise because PLC, PLICO and/or UDC-CA terminated employees

Affiliate&#146;s failure to offer Comparable Jobs to the Business Employees.
Purchaser further agrees that after the Closing Date it shall be responsible for
any notification required under the WARN Act with respect to any employment loss
by Transferred Employees occurring after the Closing Date and shall indemnify
and hold harmless PLC and its subsidiaries from and against all payments,
benefits costs, related expenses (including attorney&#146;s fees and expenses
incurred) and fines which may become due under the WARN Act due to
Purchaser&#146;s failure to comply with the WARN Act after the Closing Date with

Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay over the amount of any such refund or

administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a &#147;Tax
Contest&#148;) shall be delivered, sent, commenced, or initiated to, by or
against Purchaser or any of the Companies by any taxing authority with respect
to Taxes that results in or may result in a Tax Loss for which indemnification
may be claimed from Sellers under this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly
notify Sellers in writing of such Tax Contest; provided that the failure to so
notify Sellers shall not relieve Sellers of their indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that such failure prejudices Sellers&#146;
defense of the Tax Contest. Sellers shall have the sole right to represent the
Companies&#146; interests and to employ counsel of their choice at their expense
with respect to any such Tax Contest; and Purchaser shall cause each of the
applicable Companies to execute any powers of attorney or other documents or
forms necessary in order to allow Sellers to control such Tax Contest and to
settle any such Tax Contest; provided that in the case of any Tax Contest
relating to any Tax for any Straddle Period, Purchaser and Sellers shall each be
entitled to participate at their own expense in such Tax Contest to the extent
it relates to a Tax for which such party bears liability pursuant to Section
9.1. No party may settle or otherwise dispose of any Tax Contest for which
another party may have a liability under Section 9.1 or which settlement could
adversely affect either party in Tax periods for which such party is responsible
or for which another party may be entitled to a refund or credit under Section
9.1 without the prior written consent of such other party, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that Sellers
do not take control of a Tax Contest that they have the right to control
hereunder, Purchaser and the Companies shall keep Sellers reasonably informed as
to the progress of such Tax Contest and shall not enter into any settlement or
other disposition of the such Tax Contest prior to receiving the written consent
of Sellers, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In no event, without the prior written consent of PLC, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall Purchaser or the
Companies grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations in respect
of any Tax period ending prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period. </FONT></P>

the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 9.4 and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party&#146;s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Purchaser, the Companies and Sellers agree (A) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser or any of
Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
(B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, the Companies or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records. </FONT></P>

Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). Purchaser and Sellers further
agree, upon request, to provide the other party with all information that either
party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code. </FONT></P>

which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Stock Price based on the March 31, 2001 Adjusted Equity of the Companies shall
be allocated among the Companies in the amounts set forth on Schedule 9.4(g).
Upon determination of the final Stock Price as provided in Sections 3.4 and 3.5

Group, and if Benefits Plans Group determines, in its reasonable judgment, that
FBIC&#146;s or its Affiliates&#146; products are appropriate for its market
needs and are competitive on the basis of premiums, benefits and commissions
with other third party Dental Insurance products, then, to the extent that such

expiration of the representations and warranties of the parties as provided in
Section 13.1 and the limitations set forth in this Article 13, PLC agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Fortis and its Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees and assigns (the &#147;Purchaser
Indemnitees&#148;) from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs, expenses, penalties and reasonable outside attorneys&#146;
fees and disbursements (collectively, &#147;Losses,&#148; and individually a
&#147;Loss&#148;), asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by them, directly
or indirectly, by reason of or arising out of or in connection with (i) any
misrepresentation, breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of
Sellers in this Agreement or the Related Agreements (other than the CAO
Certifications), (ii) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant,
undertaking or agreement of Sellers in this Agreement or the Related Agreements
(other than the CAO Certifications), (iii) Tax Losses in accordance with Article
9, (iv) Business Employee Plans in accordance with Section 8.8(d), (v)
Indemnified Matters, or (vi) the reasonable costs to the Purchaser Indemnitees
of enforcing this indemnity against PLC provided that such costs are awarded to
the Purchaser Indemnitees in accordance with Section 15.6(d). The Purchaser
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section 13.2(a) for
Losses in respect of the matters described in clause (i) immediately above and
in respect of matters described in clause (g) of the definition of
&#147;Indemnified Matters&#148; only when the aggregate amount of all such
Losses exceeds $2,500,000 (the &#147;Basket Amount&#148;), in which case the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for any and all such
Losses but only in excess of the Basket Amount; provided, however that Losses
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees for breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 5.6, 5.9, 6.2 and 6.11 and Article 9 shall not
be subject to the Basket Amount. In addition, the maximum amount for which
Sellers shall be liable under clause (i) shall not exceed $180,000,000
(&#147;Maximum Indemnification Obligation&#148;); provided, however, that Losses
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnities for breaches of the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 5.6, 5.9, 6.2 and 6.11 and Article 9 shall not
be subject to the Maximum Indemnification Obligation. For purposes of this
Section 13.2(a), and in particular clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of
this Section 13.2(a), the provisions contained in Articles 5 and 6 shall only be
considered representations and warranties, and shall not be considered
covenants, undertakings or agreements of the Sellers, PLAIC, Empire or the
Companies. For purposes of this Section 13.2(a), Losses asserted against,
imposed upon or incurred by FBIC, FFLIC or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates or assigns as a result of a violation of any of
the representations of each of PLICO, PLAIC and Empire contained in Section 4 of
the Indemnity Reinsurance Agreement to which such Person is a party shall not be
subject to the Basket Amount or the Maximum Indemnification Obligation with
respect to Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
13.2(a), for the avoidance of doubt Losses shall not include any Loss arising
from (i) any liability, obligation or other matter for which Purchaser, FBIC or
FFLIC is liable pursuant to any of the Indemnity Reinsurance Agreements or any
other Related Agreement, (ii) any Assumed Liabilities, or (iii) any liabilities
or obligations to the extent set forth on the Post Closing Equity Schedule. </FONT></P>

indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates and each of
their respective directors, officers, employees and assigns (the &#147;Seller
Indemnitees&#148;) from and against all Losses asserted against, imposed upon or
incurred by them, directly or indirectly, by reason of or arising out of or in
connection with (i) any misrepresentation, breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of Fortis in this Agreement or the Related
Agreements, (ii) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant, undertaking
or agreement of Fortis or Purchaser in this Agreement or the Related Agreements,
(iii) any income Tax refund or credit described in Section 9.4(c), (iv) Assumed
Liabilities or (v)&#160;the reasonable costs to the Seller Indemnitees of
enforcing this indemnity against Fortis provided that such costs are awarded to
the Seller Indemnitees in accordance with Section 15.6(d). The Seller
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section 13.2(b) in
respect of the matters described in clause (i) immediately above only when the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case the
Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for any and all such
Losses but only in excess of the Basket Amount. In addition, the maximum amount
for which Fortis shall be liable under such clause (i) shall not exceed the
Maximum Indemnification Obligation. For purposes of this Section 13.2(b), the
provisions contained in Article 7 shall only be considered representations and
warranties and shall not be considered covenants, undertakings or agreements of
Fortis, Purchaser, FFLIC or FBIC. For purposes of this Section 13.2(b), Losses
asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by PLICO, PLAIC or Empire or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or assigns as a
result of a violation of any of the representations of each of FBIC and FFLIC
contained in Section 4 of the Indemnity Reinsurance Agreement to which such
Person is a party shall not be subject to the Basket Amount or the Maximum
Indemnification Obligation with respect to Fortis. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 13.2(b), for the avoidance of doubt Losses shall not
include any Loss arising from any liability, obligation or other matter for
which PLICO, Empire or PLAIC is liable pursuant to any of the Indemnity
Reinsurance Agreements or any other Related Agreement, or (ii) any Excluded
Liabilities (as defined in the Indemnity Reinsurance Agreements). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Required payments by an
indemnifying party pursuant to this Article 13 shall be limited to the amount of
any Loss that remains after deducting therefrom (i) any net tax benefit actually
received by the indemnified party, (ii)&#160;any insurance proceeds recovered by
the indemnified party, and (iii) any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment recovered by the indemnified party from any third party, in each case
with respect to such Loss. The indemnified party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect all such insurance proceeds and indemnity,
contribution and other similar payments. </FONT></P>

commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an &#147;Asserted

written notice thereof (the &#147;Claims Notice&#148;) to the indemnifying
party. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable
detail and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that
has been or may be suffered by such indemnified party and shall include a
statement as to the basis for the indemnification sought. Failure to provide a
Claims Notice in a timely manner shall not be deemed a waiver of the indemnified
party&#146;s right to indemnification other than to the extent that such failure
prejudices the defense of the claim by the indemnifying party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Section 13.4 <u>Opportunity to
Defend.</u></b> The indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own

indemnifying party may not compromise or settle any Asserted Liability without
the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (i) such compromise or
settlement requires no more than a monetary payment for which the indemnified
party hereunder is fully indemnified and such settlement provides a complete
release of, or dismissal with prejudice of, all claims against the indemnified
party for all matters that were or could have been asserted in connection with
such claim, or (ii)&#160;involves no other matters binding upon the indemnified
party (other than obligations of confidentiality). If the indemnifying party
elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, it shall within thirty
(30) calendar days from receipt of the Claims Notice notify the indemnified
party of its intent to do so, and the indemnified party shall cooperate, at the
expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against,
such Asserted Liability. If the indemnified party shall fail to cooperate, then
each indemnifying party shall be relieved of its obligations under this Article
13 only to the extent that such indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure
to cooperate. Unless and until the indemnifying party elects to defend the
Asserted Liability, the indemnified party shall have the right, at its option,
to do so in such manner as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that the
indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any Asserted Liability for
which it seeks indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of
the indemnifying party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in (but not to
control) the defense of any Asserted Liability that it has elected not to defend
with its own counsel and at its own expense. </FONT></P>
