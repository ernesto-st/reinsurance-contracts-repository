On  March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) publicly announced that: (a)  immediately after December 31, 2021, publication of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR  settings will permanently cease; immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and  12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; and immediately after June 30,  2023, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided  or, subject to the FCA&#8217;s consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer  be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and  that representativeness will not be restored.

If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent  by such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on  demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from such Credit Date until  the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the customary rate set by Administrative  Agent for the correction of errors among banks for three Business Days and thereafter at the  Alternate Base Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after  giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if the applicable recipient shall have  received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by that section of the Criminal Code  (Canada), then the Canadian Loan Parties shall be entitled, by notice in writing to the  Administrative Agent, to obtain reimbursement from the applicable recipient in an amount equal  to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount  payable by the applicable recipient to the applicable Canadian Loan Party.    2.8 Conversion/Continuation.

(b) The Borrower shall deliver a Conversion/Continuation Notice to  Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least one Business Day in  advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a conversion to an ABR Loan) and at least  three Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a  conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan). Except as otherwise provided herein,  a Conversion/Continuation Notice for conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Loans  (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable, and the Borrower shall be bound to effect  a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith.  </FONT></DIV>

(a) Application of Voluntary Prepayments.

(b) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. Subject to Section 2.14(d), any  prepayment of any Loan pursuant to Section 2.13 shall be applied to prepay Term Loans on a pro  rata basis to the remaining scheduled Installments of principal of the Term Loans (excluding the  payment payable on the Maturity Date).    (c) Application of Prepayments of Loans to ABR Loans and Eurodollar Rate  Loans. Any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to ABR Loans to the full extent thereof before  application to Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of  any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.17(c).

Promptly after the date of receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall  provide written notice (the &#8220;First Offer&#8221;) to the Lenders of the amount available to prepay the  Term Loans. Any Lender declining such prepayment (a &#8220;Declining Lender&#8221;) shall give written  notice thereof to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m. no later than two Business Days after the  date of such notice from the Administrative Agent. On such date the Administrative Agent shall  then provide written notice (the &#8220;Second Offer&#8221;) to the Lenders other than the Declining Lenders  (such Lenders being the &#8220;Accepting Lenders&#8221;) of the additional amount available (due to such  Declining Lenders&#8217; declining such prepayment) to prepay Term Loans owing to such Accepting  Lenders, such available amount to be allocated on a pro rata basis among the Accepting Lenders  that accept the Second Offer. Any Lender declining prepayment pursuant to such Second Offer  shall give written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m. no later than one  Business Day after the date of such notice of a Second Offer. The Borrower shall prepay the Loans  as set forth in Section 2.13 within one Business Day after its receipt of notice from the  Administrative Agent of the aggregate amount of such prepayment. Amounts remaining after the  allocation of accepted amounts with respect to the First Offer and the Second Offer to Accepting  Lenders shall be retained by the Borrower (such amounts, the &#8220;Declined Proceeds&#8221;).    2.15 General Provisions Regarding Payments.  </FONT></DIV>

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital  requirements or liquidity has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such  Lender&#8217;s capital or on the capital of such Lender&#8217;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of  this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such  Lender&#8217;s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into  consideration such Lender&#8217;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#8217;s holding company with  respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such  Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender  or such Lender&#8217;s holding company for any such reduction suffered.  </FONT></DIV>

Each Lender shall severally indemnify the  Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent for the full amount of any Taxes (but, in the case  of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the  obligation of the Credit Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the  Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with any Credit Document and any  reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were  correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity  under this Section 2.19(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent or the  Collateral Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid  or payable by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive  of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the  Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender  under any Credit Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from  any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.19(e).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the  completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set  forth in Section 2.19(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s judgment  such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material  unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of  such Lender.

Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing, if Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any  Guarantor&#8217;s covenant to pay a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, such judgment shall not be  deemed to release such Guarantor from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guaranteed  Obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such judgment shall not, except to the extent  satisfied by such Guarantor, limit, affect, modify or abridge any other Guarantor&#8217;s liability  hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations;    (e) any Beneficiary, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or  demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction,  limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any Guarantor&#8217;s liability hereunder, from time  to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the  time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise,  release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions  for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or subordinate the payment  of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the  Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security for the payment hereof or the Guaranteed  Obligations; (iv) release, surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter,  subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guaranteed  Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other obligation of any  Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce  and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Beneficiary in respect  hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise  any other right or remedy that such Beneficiary may have against any such security, in each case  as such Beneficiary in its discretion may determine consistent herewith and any applicable security  agreement,  including  foreclosure  on  any  such  security  pursuant  to  one  or  more  judicial or  </FONT></DIV>

Any Indebtedness of the Company or any  Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (the &#8220;Obligee Guarantor&#8221;) is hereby  subordinated in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations, and any such indebtedness  collected or received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Beneficiaries and shall  forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Beneficiaries to be credited and  applied against the Guaranteed Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any  manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision hereof.    7.8 Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall remain in  effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Term Loan  Commitments and any Additional Term Loan Commitments shall have terminated.

Any Credit Extension may be made to the  Company or continued from time to time without notice to or authorization from any Guarantor  regardless of the financial or other condition of the Company at the time of any such grant or  continuation, as the case may be. No Beneficiary shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss  with any Guarantor its assessment, or any Guarantor&#8217;s assessment, of the financial condition of  the Company. Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from the Company on a  continuing basis concerning the financial condition of the Company and its ability to perform its  obligations under the Credit Documents, and each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being  and keeping informed of the financial condition of the Company and of all circumstances bearing  upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and  relinquishes any duty on the part of any Beneficiary to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating  to the business, operations or conditions of the Company now known or hereafter known by any  Beneficiary.    7.11 Bankruptcy, etc.    (a) So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding, no Guarantor  shall, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions  of Requisite Lenders, commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy,  reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding of or against the Company or any other Guarantor.

Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the  benefit of creditors or similar person to pay Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of  Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such case or  proceeding is commenced.    (c) In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid  by the Company, the obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall continue and remain in full force  and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s)  are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Beneficiary as a preference, fraudulent  transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute  Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes hereunder.    7.12 Discharge of Guaranty Upon Sale of Guarantor. If all of the Capital Stock of  any Guarantor or any of its successors in interest hereunder shall be sold or otherwise disposed of  (including by merger, amalgamation or consolidation) in accordance with the terms and conditions  hereof, the Guaranty of such Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the case may be, hereunder  shall automatically be discharged and released without any further action by any Beneficiary or  any other Person effective as of the time of such Asset Sale.

In addition, if  when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into  account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have  been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been  in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent an  amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest  which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and the Company to conform strictly  to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any  consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess  shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender&#8217;s option be applied  to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower.    10.19 Counterparts.
