Delaware limited liability company, U.N. Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, Wind River Investment Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Wind River&#148;), and those Trusts listed on Schedule A thereto. As a result of transactions

of Common Shares (as defined in the Investment Agreement) and Preferred Shares (as defined in the Investment Agreement) of Global Indemnity (collectively, the &#147;<I>Shares</I>&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The current parties to the Management Agreement, the Company and Fox Paine, hereby amend and restate in its entirety the Management Agreement
to reflect the intents and purposes of the Original Agreement as amended by the First Amendment, as assigned, assumed and further amended by the Second Amendment and as further amended by the Third Amendment, together with certain additional
modifications as of this date reflected herein (the &#147;Amended and Restated Management Agreement&#148;). This Amended and Restated Management Agreement reflects the entire agreement of the parties and replaces and supersedes the Original
Agreement, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the ongoing operations of the Company

the Company and its affiliates (collectively, the &#147;Services&#148;). Beginning on September&nbsp;5, 2013, the annual service fee increased to $1,900,409.00 to reflect the aggregate increase in the Consumer Price Index as published by the U.S.
Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (the &#147;CPI-U&#148;) from August&nbsp;31, 2003 to August&nbsp;31, 2013, and will be further increased each year beginning September&nbsp;5, 2014 by an amount to reflect the percentage change in the
CPI-U from the beginning of the twelve month period to the end of the twelve month period ended August&nbsp;31 (the annual service fee as so increased annually, the &#147;Annual Service Fee&#148;). In addition, beginning on September&nbsp;5, 2014,
the Annual Service Fee will be subject to an adjustment amount (the &#147;Adjustment Amount&#148;) equal to: (i)&nbsp;on each September&nbsp;5 (the &#147;Annual Accrual Date&#148;), the percentage rate of return the Company earned on its investment

occurs on any date other than an Annual Accrual Date, the percentage rate of return the Company earned on its investment portfolio over the period since the last Annual Accrual Date to have occurred before the Triggering Event through the date of
the Triggering Event multiplied by the aggregate Annual Service Fees and Adjustment Amounts accumulated and unpaid through such date. For the avoidance of doubt, an example of how the Annual Service Fee will be adjusted annually is as follows: if
the CPI increases 2% from August&nbsp;31, 2013 to August&nbsp;31, 2014, then the Annual Service Fee for September&nbsp;5, 2014 will be increased by 2% from $1,900,409.00 to $1,938,417.18. If the CPI again increases by 2% from September&nbsp;1, 2014
to September&nbsp;1, 2015 and the Company earns 3% on its investment portfolio over the same period, then the Annual Service Fee for September&nbsp;5, 2015 will be increased from $1,938,417.18 to $1,977,185.52, and the Adjustment Amount for
September&nbsp;5, 2015 will be $58,152.52 which is 3% of the Annual Service Fee of $1,938,417 accrued on September&nbsp;5, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since

Date&#148;). Beginning September&nbsp;5, 2014, the Annual Service Fee and Adjustment Amount will accrue annually on September&nbsp;5 of each year and accumulate over time, but will not be billed and payable on or before November&nbsp;1 of such year.
Instead, the accumulated Annual Service Fees and Adjustment Amounts will be billed in one lump sum and payable in full upon the first to occur of: (I)&nbsp;the closing of a Change of Control and (II) September&nbsp;5, 2018 (the earlier of such
events to occur, the &#147;Triggering Event&#148;); <I>provided</I> that if the event described in clause II occurs first, then each Annual Service Fee payable following the occurrence of such event shall be billed to the Company by Fox Paine and
paid on or before the Payment Date. The Company shall provide quarterly statements of account to Fox Paine indicating as of the last day of each such calendar quarter, the Aggregate Annual Service Fees and Adjustment Amounts accrued and unpaid as of

transaction that does not constitute a &#147;Change of Control&#148; and to pay to Fox Paine a mutually agreed advisory or arrangement/finders fee in connection with the provision of such services. </P>

and indirect expenses paid or incurred in connection with the Services and/or Advisory Services, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with efforts to arrange or consummate a Change of Control as well as for reasonable, estimated
