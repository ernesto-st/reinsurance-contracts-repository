THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is made and entered into as of
June 26, 2003 by and among NYLCARE HEALTH PLANS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Seller"), AETNA INC., a Pennsylvania corporation, as guarantor for Seller
("Seller Guarantor") DIRECT GENERAL CORPORATION, a Tennessee corporation
("Purchaser"), and NEW YORK LIFE & HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY, a Delaware stock
life insurance company (the "Company"), pursuant to which Seller shall sell and
Purchaser shall acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and any
options, warrants or other securities exercisable for, or convertible into,
capital stock (collectively, the "Shares") of Company.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, Seller owns 2,000 shares of common stock, $1,250 par value, of
the Company, which shares of common stock constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company; and

         WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser desires to
purchase from Seller the Shares on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth; and

         WHEREAS, the Company is authorized in the State of Delaware and the
other jurisdictions identified on Exhibit C hereto to transact the businesses
specified in the respective certificates of authority attached hereto as Exhibit
C-1 (collectively, the "Certificates of Authority"); and

         WHEREAS, Purchaser's intent in acquiring the Shares is that, at the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.3 hereof), the Company's assets will
consist primarily of the Company's corporate franchise, its licenses and
authority to transact the businesses specified in the Certificates of Authority,
and certain other assets approved by Purchaser and listed on a Schedule
delivered to each party at Closing, and that the Company will have no
liabilities other than as set forth on the Company's balance sheet as of the
last day of the calendar month immediately prior to the calendar month during
which the Closing Date occurs. Certain of the Company's remaining non-insurance
related liabilities will be terminated or assigned, as provided herein; and

         WHEREAS, Seller and the Company acknowledge and agree that all
representations, warranties and covenants made by Seller herein have been made
to induce Purchaser to purchase the Shares from Seller and that without such
inducement, Purchaser would not purchase the Shares; and

         WHEREAS, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all representations,
warranties, and covenants made by Purchaser herein have been made to induce
Seller to sell the Shares to Purchaser and that without such inducement Seller
would not sell the Shares.

                                        1

<PAGE>

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do
hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1.
                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

         1.1      AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND SELL. At the Closing (as defined in
Section 1.3) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and in reliance on the representations, warranties and covenants herein set
forth, Purchaser shall, on the terms set forth herein, purchase and accept the
Shares from Seller, and Seller shall, on the terms set forth herein, sell,
convey, transfer, assign and deliver the Shares to Purchaser free and clear of
any and all liens, claims, options, charges, encumbrances, rights or
restrictions of any kind or nature, whether or not of record (hereinafter,
"Liens").

         1.2      PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT.

         (a)      The total purchase price for the Shares (the "Purchase Price")
shall be computed as the sum of:

                  (i)      An amount equal to Company's "Adjusted Book Value" as
of the last day of the calendar month immediately prior to the calendar month
during which the Closing Date occurs; and

                  (ii)     Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) per jurisdiction
in which the Company is licensed as an insurer on the Closing Date that includes
life authority and $30,000 for the Company's North Carolina Accident and Health,
including Hospitalizations, insurance license if the Company holds such a
license on the Closing Date. In no event, however, shall the Purchase Price
include any compensation for a license in any jurisdiction that requires
statutory surplus in excess of $5,500,000 in order to maintain such license in
good standing.

         For purposes of this Agreement, the Company's Adjusted Book Value as of
any date shall be an amount equal to the following:

         (A)      cash on deposit as specified on the Company's balance sheet as
                  of such date; PLUS;

         (B)      fair value of investment securities as specified on the
                  Company's balance sheet as of such date; PLUS;

         (C)      accrued investment income on investment securities as
                  specified on the Company's balance sheet as of such date
                  MINUS;

         (D)      state income tax liabilities related to 2003 results as
                  specified on the Company's balance sheet as of such date.

                                        2

<PAGE>

         (b)      Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price to Seller on the
Closing Date in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, provided,
however, that applicable bank account information shall have been provided to
Purchaser at least twenty-four (24) hours (or, in the event the Closing Date is
a Monday or a nationally recognized holiday, at least seventy-two (72) hours)
prior to the Closing Date.

         (c)      Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause Company's statutory
surplus to be not more than $5,500,000.00 and not less than the minimum amount
of assets required by Applicable Law (as defined in Section 2.12 hereof) to
maintain all the Company's insurance licenses in good standing.

         1.3      CLOSING. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.
New York City local time on the date set forth in this Section 1.3, and shall be
conducted by wire transfer and facsimile transmission, augmented as necessary by
overnight delivery service. The "Closing Date" shall be the date on which the
Closing occurs. The Closing shall occur as on the second business day of the
month after which the closing conditions specified in Articles 6 and 7 of this
Agreement are satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, or some
other date mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing, provided all
conditions of this Agreement have been satisfied or waived. Prior to or at the
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser stock certificate(s) and other
instruments representing the Shares, duly endorsed in blank for transfer or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers duly executed in blank, and such other
documents and instruments as are required under the terms of this Agreement. All
such documents and instruments will be in form and content reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser and its counsel. When the Closing is completed,
Purchaser shall thereupon have the right and be entitled to take possession of
the Company and all of its assets, books and records.

         1.4      ACTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING. At the reasonable request of
Purchaser or Seller, after the Closing, and without further consideration except

         (a) The Company exists as a corporation in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware, including, without limitation, Chapter 5 of the
Delaware insurance laws and Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
and has all corporate power to conduct its business as currently conducted,
including as a Delaware stock insurer. A true and correct copy of the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation certified by the Delaware Secretary of State is
attached hereto as Exhibit A-1. A true and correct copy of the Company's
Certificate of Authority issued by the Delaware Department of Insurance is
attached hereto as Exhibit B. A true and correct copy of the Company's Bylaws as

all Liens. The Company is also duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary in connection with the
conduct of the Company's business as currently conducted (a list of which
jurisdictions as of the date hereof is set forth on Schedule 2.3(a)), except for
those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing as
a foreign corporation has not had and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect as defined in Section 2.11 hereof. The
Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws.

         (b)      The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to

Company, and, except for the Regulatory Approvals (as defined in Section 2.7(d)
hereof), no other proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize such execution, delivery and performance. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
the terms hereof, except as such enforcement may be limited by the applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, preferential
transfer, moratorium and other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors' of insurance companies generally or
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is

hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of
Seller's obligations hereunder shall be evidenced at the Closing by execution of
the Closing documents and transfer of the Shares, and, except for the Regulatory
Approvals, no other proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize
such execution, delivery and performance. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with the terms hereof,
except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent transfer, preferential transfer, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors'

the party receiving the same and shall survive the Closing for a period of three
(3) years regardless of any investigation by or knowledge of such party and
shall not merge into the performance of any obligation by any party hereto;

"Loss" or "Losses") sustained, suffered or incurred by or made against any
Purchaser Indemnified Party arising out of, based upon or in connection with
(such Losses described in Sections 8.2(a) through 8.2(d) inclusive being herein
collectively referred to as "Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses"):

         (a)      conditions, circumstances or occurrences which constitute or
result in any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement, or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or

<PAGE>

respect to periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Periods") except such accrued Taxes reflected on the Company's
balance sheet as of the Closing Date; and

         (d)      any and all claims, obligations or other liabilities of any
kind or nature of the Company, known or unknown, accrued, contingent or
otherwise, to the extent they relate to or to the extent they result from
conditions or circumstances arising or events occurring before the Closing Date
(collectively, "Pre-Closing Liabilities"), including without limitation the
following:

                  (i)      any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of the
Company, whether reported or unreported, for contractual obligations under
insurance policies or annuity contracts of the Company issued before the Closing
Date;

                  (ii)     any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of the
Company with respect to claims or potential claims for medical malpractice or
professional liability with respect to the conduct of the Company's insurance
and/or annuity business before the Closing Date, in each case regardless of when
the claim is asserted;

                  (iii)    any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of the
Company relating to litigation or claims of any kind or nature with respect to
the conduct of the Company's insurance, reinsurance, annuity and/or other

the claim is asserted; and

                  (iv)     any liability of any kind to, or with respect to,

vacation or severance pay, or with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans of the
Company (including all obligations pursuant to the continuation coverage rules
of ERISA Sections 601-608 and Internal Revenue Code Section 4980B).

         8.3      INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER. Subject to the limitations set
forth herein, Purchaser on behalf of itself and its successors and permitted
assigns as contemplated by Section 11.2 agrees subsequent to the Closing Date to
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its affiliates, subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(individually, a "Seller Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties") from and against and in respect of all Losses sustained,
suffered or incurred by or made against any Seller Indemnified Party arising out
of, based upon or in connection with (such Losses described in Sections 8.3(a)
through 8.3(d) inclusive being herein collectively referred to as "Seller
Indemnifiable Losses"):

         (a)      conditions, circumstances or occurrences which constitute or
result in any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this
Agreement, or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or
instituted arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy in such representations
or warranties;

                                       25

<PAGE>

         (b)      any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Purchaser in
this Agreement or by reason of any claim, action or proceeding asserted or
instituted arising out of or relating to a breach of any such covenant or
agreement;

         (c)      any and all Taxes (including but not limited to Taxes
allocated to the Company pursuant to any tax allocation agreement between the
Company and any other Person) imposed on or with respect to or otherwise
attributable to the Company with respect to periods, or portions thereof, ending
after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Periods"); and

         (d)      any and all claims, obligations or other liabilities of any
kind or nature of the Company, known or unknown, accrued, contingent or
otherwise, to the extent they relate to or to the extent they result from
conditions or circumstances arising or events occurring after the Closing Date
(collectively, "Post-Closing Liabilities"), including without limitation the
following:

                  (i)      any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of the
Company, whether reported or unreported, for contractual obligations under
insurance policies or annuity contracts of the Company issued after the Closing
Date;

                  (ii)     any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of the
Company with respect to claims or potential claims for medical malpractice or
professional liability with respect to the conduct of the Company's insurance
and/or annuity business after the Closing Date, in each case regardless of when

                  (iii)    any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of the
Company relating to litigation or claims of any kind or nature with respect to
the conduct of the Company's insurance, reinsurance, annuity and/or other

                  (iv)     any liability of any kind to, or with respect to,
natural Persons employed by the Company after to the Closing Date, including
without limitation, salaries or compensation of any kind, continued employment,
vacation or severance pay, or with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans of the
Company (including all obligations pursuant to the continuation coverage rules
of ERISA Sections 601-608 and Internal Revenue Code Section 4980B).

         8.4      NOTICE; DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

         (a)      (i) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice
of any claim, liability or expense to which the indemnification obligations
hereunder would apply, the indemnified party shall give notice thereof in
writing to the indemnifying party (the Purchaser with respect to claims by
Seller Indemnified Parties and Seller with respect to claims by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties), but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party
promptly will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability except to
the

                                       26

<PAGE>

extent that the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of the
failure or delay in giving such notice. Such notice shall state the information
then available regarding the amount and nature of such claim, liability or
expense and shall specify the provision or provisions of this Agreement under
which the liability or obligation is asserted.

                  (ii)     If an indemnifying party receives from a person other
than an indemnified party notice of any claim, liability or expense to which the
indemnification obligations hereunder would apply, the indemnifying party
promptly shall give notice thereof in writing to the indemnified party. Such
notice shall state the information then available regarding the amount and
nature of such claim, liability or expense and shall specify the applicable
provision or provisions of this Agreement and the indemnifying party's proposed
resolution of such claim, liability or expense.

         (b)      In the event an indemnification claim relates to any suit,
action, or proceeding brought by any third party against an indemnified party,
if within 20 days after receiving such notice the indemnifying party gives
written notice to the indemnified party stating that the indemnifying party (i)
would be liable under the provisions hereof for indemnity in the amount of such
claim if such claim were successful, (ii) shall be fully responsible (with no
reservation of any rights) for all liabilities relating to such claim, liability
or expense and that it will provide full indemnification (whether or not
otherwise required hereunder) to the indemnified party with respect to such
claim, liability or expense, and (iii) disputes the third party claim and
intends to defend against such claim, liability or expense at its own cost and
expense, then counsel for the defense shall be selected by the indemnifying
party (subject to the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) and the indemnifying party shall not be required to
make any payment to the indemnified party with respect to such claim, liability
or expense if and so long as the indemnifying party is conducting a good faith
and diligent defense at its own expense; provided, however, that the assumption
of defense of any such matters by the indemnifying party shall relate solely to
the claim, liability or expense that is subject or potentially subject to
indemnification, and provided further that prior to such assumption of defense
the indemnifying party shall enter into an agreement with the indemnified party
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party pursuant
to which the indemnifying party unconditionally guarantees the payment and
performance of any liability or obligation which may arise out of or in any way
relating to such claim, liability or expense or the facts giving rise thereto.
The indemnifying party shall have the right, with the consent of the indemnified
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to settle all
indemnifiable matters related to claims by third parties which are susceptible
to being settled by making payments, provided the indemnifying party's
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party will be fully satisfied by the
making of such payments. The indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party
apprised of the status of the claim, liability or expense and any resulting
suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish the indemnified party with
all documents and information that the indemnified party shall reasonably
request and shall consult with the indemnified party prior to acting on major
matters, including settlement discussions. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 8.4 (b) to the

                                       27

<PAGE>

contrary, the indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully
participate in such defense at its own expense directly or through counsel;
provided, however, if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
parties by the same counsel or of the indemnified party by counsel representing
the indemnifying party, would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct, the expense of separate counsel for the indemnified party
shall be paid by the indemnifying party and the rights of the indemnifying party
to control the defense and settle the claims shall not apply.

         (c)      If no notice of intent to dispute and defend is given by the
indemnifying party as provided in Section 8.4(b), or if such diligent good faith
defense is not being or ceases to be conducted, the indemnified party shall have
the right, at the expense of the indemnifying party, to undertake the defense of
(with counsel selected by the indemnified party), and shall have the right to
compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment), such claim,
liability or expense. If such claim, liability or expense is one that by its
nature cannot be defended solely by the indemnifying party or otherwise at the
reasonable request of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall make
available all information and assistance that the indemnifying party may
reasonably request and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in such
defense.

         8.5      RECOVERIES. The amount of any Losses suffered, sustained,
incurred or required to be paid by any indemnifying party shall be reduced by
the amount of any insurance or reinsurance proceeds paid to the indemnified
party by any Person not a party to this Agreement.

         8.6      SATISFACTION OF INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. Except as
provided in Section 8.4(b) hereof, any indemnity payable pursuant to this
Article 8 shall be paid within twenty (20) calendar days after the indemnified
party's written request for such indemnity accompanied by reasonably
satisfactory documentation supporting the alleged claim for indemnification;
provided, however, that the indemnified party may in its sole discretion, elect
not to make a claim against any applicable insurance coverage to recover any
losses; and to rely instead solely on the indemnification provided for herein.

         8.7      LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. Except for
indemnification obligations with respect to Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing
Periods described in Section 8.2(c) and Pre-Closing Liabilities described in
Section 8.2(d) (for which Seller shall provide indemnification dollar-for-dollar
for all Losses), Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in respect to Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses except to the
extent the cumulative amount of all Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses exceeds
$50,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), whereupon the amount of all such Purchaser
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount shall be recoverable in
accordance with the terms hereof. Except for indemnification obligations with
respect to Taxes with respect to Post-Closing Periods described in Section
8.3(c) and Post-Closing Liabilities described in Section 8.3(d) (for which
Purchaser shall provide indemnification dollar for dollar for all Losses),
Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties in
respect to Seller Indemnifiable Losses except to the extent the

                                       28

<PAGE>

cumulative amount of all Seller Indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Threshold
Amount, whereupon the amount of all Seller Indemnifiable Losses in excess of the
Threshold Amount shall be recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof.
Except for indemnification obligations with respect to Taxes with respect to
Pre-Closing Periods and Pre-Closing Liabilities (for which there shall be no
limit on Seller's liability), the total of Purchaser's Indemnifiable Losses
under this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to the portion of the
Purchase Price specified in Section 1.2(a)(ii). Except for indemnification
obligations with respect to Taxes with respect to Post-Closing Periods and
Post-Closing Liabilities (for which there shall be no limit on Purchaser's
liability), the total of Seller's Indemnifiable Losses under this Agreement
shall not exceed an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price specified
in Section 1.2(a)(ii).

                                    ARTICLE 9
                                      TAXES

         9.1      COOPERATION AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. The Company and its
affiliates will not, unless otherwise required by law, rule or regulation or
unless doing so would have no effect on any Taxes for which Seller are or may be
liable hereunder, adopt a Tax treatment of any material item that is
inconsistent with the past treatment of similar items of the Company in any
previously filed Tax Return. Seller and Purchaser will provide, or cause to be
provided, to each other prompt notice of and copies of all correspondence
received from any taxing authority by Seller, Purchaser or the Company in
connection with any liability for Losses relating to Taxes for which the other
party is or may be liable hereunder. The parties will provide each other with
the cooperation and information as they may reasonably request of each other in
preparing or filing any Return, amended Return, or claim for refund, in
determining a liability or a right to refund or in conducting any audit or other
administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of Taxes imposed on the
parties, the Company or their respective affiliates, or for which a party may be
required to indemnify another party pursuant to this Agreement.

         9.2      PURCHASER'S ACCESS. Seller will grant or cause to be granted
to Purchaser, the Company or their representatives access at all reasonable
times to all of the information, books and records relating to the Company
within Seller' possession or control (including, without limitation, Tax work
papers, Tax Returns and correspondence with Tax authorities), including the
right to take extracts therefrom and make copies thereof at the expense of the
Company, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with Taxes and Tax
disputes to which this Agreement applies and shall furnish the assistance and
cooperation of such Personnel and affiliates of Seller as Purchaser may
reasonably request in connection therewith. Seller will maintain all records of
the Company not delivered for permanent possession to the Buyer at or before
Closing for a period of five (5) years from the date of Closing.

         9.3      CONFIDENTIALITY. Any information obtained by a party hereto or
its affiliates from another party hereto or its affiliates in connection with
any Tax matters to which this

                                       29

<PAGE>

Agreement applies shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or
in conducting an audit or other proceeding. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and any employee, representative, or
other agent of any party to this Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to
such tax treatment and tax structure. However, any such information relating to
the tax treatment or tax structure is required to be kept confidential to the
extent necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws.

         9.4      PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS. Seller shall prepare or cause to
be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns, including
premium Tax Returns, for the Company that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and
Purchaser shall cause such returns to be promptly executed on behalf of the
Company. Seller shall permit Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence and shall make such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Purchaser. Seller shall be liable for
and shall reimburse Purchaser for all Taxes of the Company with respect to all
pre-Closing periods, within fifteen (15) days after payment by Purchaser or the
Company of such Taxes. To the extent a short-period Tax Return is not required
for the period from January 1, 2003 through the Closing Date, Seller shall be
responsible for the portion of such Taxes allocable to the period from 1/1/03
through to Closing and shall reimburse Purchaser with respect to such Taxes.

         9.5      ALLOCATION BETWEEN PERIODS. All Taxes shall be determined on
the basis of an interim closing of the books of the Company as though its Tax
year ended on the Closing Date; provided, that the allocable portion of any
periodic Tax that is not based on income, receipts or transactions shall be
determined by apportioning the Tax for the entire taxable year based upon the
number of days in the pre-Closing period and post-Closing period. The books and
records of the Company shall be closed at the end of business on the Closing
Date, and for purposes of this Agreement, a short Tax-year period shall end for
the period January 1, 2003 through the Closing Date. Seller shall prepare or
cause to be prepared, and shall execute on behalf of the Company and file or
cause to be filed in a timely manner all federal Tax Returns for the Company for
all periods ending on the Closing Date.

         9.6      TAX TREATMENT OF TRANSACTIONS. At Purchaser's request, Seller
and the Company will join with Purchaser in making a joint election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the sale of the Shares, and each
party shall provide all information necessary in order to make the election.
Pursuant to this election, the Company will be treated as having sold all of its
assets in a taxable transaction with the gain or loss from such transaction
being included in Seller' consolidated tax returns. Any resulting tax
liabilities shall not be paid from assets of the Company.

         9.7      ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. If an election is made under
Section 338(h)(10) Code, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date but in no
event later than sixty

                                       30

<PAGE>

(60) days prior to the date the Section 338(h)(10) election is filed, Purchaser
and Seller shall agree in writing to the allocation of the Purchase Price among
the assets treated as having been sold for federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Section 338(h)(10) election. Neither Purchaser, the Company nor
Seller shall, thereafter, take any position inconsistent with the election or
the allocations. Seller will cooperate in Purchaser's efforts, and will take all
necessary and appropriate actions (including filing such forms, returns,
elections, schedules and other documents as may be required), to effect and
preserve a timely 338(h)(10) election.

         9.8      TRANSFER TAXES. Purchaser shall pay the cost of any and all
sales, use, transfer or other similar Taxes imposed as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         9.9      TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. All tax sharing or indemnification
agreements and all power of attorney arrangements, or any similar agreements of
any kind involving the Company, shall be terminated on or before the Closing,
and all payment obligations thereunder shall be paid, settled, and satisfied
prior to the Closing. Seller shall have no authority to charge back any Tax
deficiencies to the Company after the Closing and shall assume any and all
liability for any such deficiencies that could be asserted against the Company.

         9.10     PREMIUM TAX AUDITS. Seller shall be liable for, and shall hold
Purchaser and the Company harmless from, (a) any and all costs associated with
any premium tax audit conducted by a state tax collecting and/or regulatory
authority with respect to periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (b)
any and all premium taxes, penalties, interest or other amounts that may be
found to be due and/or owing as a result of such an audit.

                                   ARTICLE 10.
                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         10.1     METHODS OF TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

         (a)      by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

         (b)      by Purchaser, if all of the conditions set forth in Article 6
of this Agreement shall not have been satisfied or waived within one hundred
twenty (120) calendar days after the date hereof;

         (c)      by Seller, if all of the conditions set forth in Article 7 of
this Agreement shall not have been satisfied or waived within one hundred twenty
(120) calendar days after the date hereof;

         (d)      by Purchaser, if any of Seller's representations, warranties
or covenants herein are materially untrue, inaccurate, breached or failed to be
performed and such

                                       31

<PAGE>

misrepresentation, breach or failure is not cured in all material respects
within five (5) Business Days after Seller receives notice thereof from
Purchaser or such longer period as the parties may mutually agree in their sole
discretion; or

         (e)      by Seller, if any of Purchaser's representations, warranties
or covenants herein are materially untrue, inaccurate, breached or failed to be
performed, and such misrepresentation, breach or failure is not cured in all
material respects within five (5) Business Days after Purchaser receives notice
thereof from Seller or such longer period as the parties may mutually agree in
their sole discretion.

Provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement unilaterally pursuant to Section 10.1(b), 10.1(c), 10.1(d) or 10.1(e)
if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
primarily attributable to the party seeking such unilateral termination or to
any Affiliate of such party.

         10.2     EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties hereto (unless termination
and abandonment is pursuant to Section 10.1(a) hereof), and this Agreement shall
terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without
further action by Seller or Purchaser. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto to any
other party, except for any liability of any party for breaches of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth herein.

                                   ARTICLE 11.
                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         11.1     PUBLICITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE. Neither Seller nor Company nor
Purchaser shall issue any press release or other public announcement or
otherwise solicit publicity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto; provided, however, that any party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by law or regulation or otherwise required in
connection with obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, in which case the disclosing
party shall advise the other parties hereto and provide each of them with a copy
of the proposed disclosure prior to making such disclosure.

         11.2     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors,
permitted assigns and legal representatives. Neither this Agreement, nor any
right hereunder, may be directly or indirectly assigned, sublicensed or
transferred by any party, in whole or in part, to any third party, including,
without limitation, any bankruptcy trustee, by operation of law or otherwise,
whether voluntary or involuntary, without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto (with Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on
the other hand, each to be considered one party for the purposes of this
sentence); provided,

                                       32

<PAGE>

however, that, subject to applicable regulatory approvals, Purchaser may assign
the right to purchase all of the Shares to Direct General Insurance Company or
Direct Life Insurance Company; provided that no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Further, Purchaser may assign one or
more of its other wholly-owned Subsidiaries, in whole or in part, the right to
purchase all of the Shares; provided, that (a) no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder; and (b) no such assignment shall be
permitted which would materially delay the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals
or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
set forth in this Section 11.2, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Person that is not a party to this Agreement, or the legal representatives of
such Person, any rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

         11.3     BROKERS AND FINDERS. Each of Seller and Purchaser represents
and warrants to the other that, except as set forth on Schedule 11.3, it is not
liable to any broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

         11.4     EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall bear their respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees
