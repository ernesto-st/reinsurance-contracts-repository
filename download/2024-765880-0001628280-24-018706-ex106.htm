If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that, in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, such Loans shall be continued as Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month (unless an Event of Default exists and is continuing at such time and the Administrative Agent has notified the Borrower that the Required Lenders have determined that such a continuation as Term SOFR Loans is not appropriate in accordance with Section 2.02(c)). Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Loans.

For the avoidance of doubt, Base Rate Loans shall automatically continue as Base Rate Loans and Daily SOFR Loans shall automatically continue as Daily SOFR Loans unless and until such Loans are converted to Term SOFR Loans pursuant to this Section 2.02 or are repaid in accordance with this Agreement, and no Committed Loan Notice shall be required in connection with such continuation.   (b)            Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice requesting a Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the Committed Loans under the applicable Facility.   In the case of a Borrowing, each applicable Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. In any event, a Lender may cause any domestic branch or Affiliate to fund or make the amount of its Loan available in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (or in the case of (x) a Borrowing requested by the Borrower to be made on the Closing Date, the conditions set forth in Section 4.01, or (y) a Borrowing of Incremental Term Loans, the applicable conditions set forth in Section 2.16(e)), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.   (c)            Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default that is continuing, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans, or, solely with respect to Term A-3 Loans, Daily SOFR Loans, if the Administrative Agent has notified the Borrower that the Required Lenders have determined that such a continuation or conversion is not appropriate.   39 </FONT></DIV>

Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) and Class(es) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Term SOFR Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment of the applicable Class(es) of Loans. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein; provided, however, that a notice of voluntary prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned upon an event, such as the effectiveness of other credit facilities, the receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of Equity Interests or other Indebtedness or the receipt of the proceeds from a Disposition, in which case such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the Borrower if such condition is not satisfied.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.   43 </FONT></DIV>

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans or, solely in the case of Term A-3 Loans, Daily SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing), that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the Loans constituting such Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. In the event the Borrower pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall reduce the principal amount of such Borrowing (subject to the last sentence of this paragraph and any applicable provisions of Section 2.18). If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders of any Class hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders of such Class the amount due.

If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans of any Class made by it resulting in such Lender&#8217;s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans of such Class and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the relevant Class(es), or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the relevant Lenders of the relevant Class(es) ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of the relevant Class(es) or such other amounts owing them under the relevant Facilities, as applicable; provided that:   (i)&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239; if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and   (ii)&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) [reserved] or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Commitments or Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall apply).   The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.   45 </FONT></DIV>

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

Unless required by applicable Law, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02(f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.02(f) if the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.   3.02&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;Illegality.

Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans and Daily SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan to such day, or immediately, with respect to any Daily SOFR Loan or if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan to such day and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.   54 </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR, SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a &#8220;Successor Rate&#8221;. Any such amendment executed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.   The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate.   Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.   Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than 0.00%, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be 0.00% for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.   56 </FONT></DIV>

Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the applicable Loans or the applicable Commitments assigned. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent that any unused Commitments remain under a Facility at a time when any Loans are also outstanding under such Facility, any assignment by a Lender with respect to such Facility shall be a ratable assignment by such Lender of its unused Commitments and outstanding Loans under such Facility.   (iii)&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;Required Consents.

The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.

(viii)&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its relevant Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.   95  </FONT></DIV>

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.

Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.06(b); provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 3.06 and 10.13 and any requirements or limitations contained therein as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 with respect to any Participant.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender.

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 10.07 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own or its other similarly situated customers&#8217; confidential information.   Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning any Loan Party or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.   98  </FONT></DIV>

The Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations.   11.04&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;Obligations Independent.   The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.   11.05&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;Subrogation.   The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash (other than contingent Obligations that are not then due and payable) and the Commitments are terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.   107  </FONT></DIV>

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Subsidiary Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor.   109  </FONT></DIV>
