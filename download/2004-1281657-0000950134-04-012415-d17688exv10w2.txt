            2.6.1 Required Redemptions. (a) On the stated or accelerated
maturity date of the Notes, the Company will pay the principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
including, without limitation, all PIK Interest. No redemption of less than all
of the Notes shall affect the obligation of the Company to make the redemption
required by the preceding sentence. Unless the Notes (or a portion thereof) have
previously been redeemed or repurchased under Section 2.6.2, Section 2.6.4,
Section 2.6.5, Section 2.6.6, Section 2.6.7 or Section 2.6.8, the Company shall
redeem the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (including PIK Interest
capitalized pursuant thereto) in one installment in the principal amount of
$87,000,000 (or the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes) on the
Maturity Date.

                  (b)   The Company shall, if the Closing Date has not occurred
by November 30, 2004, repurchase on such date all of the Notes and Warrants
issued by the Company to the Purchasers for a repurchase price equal to the
Escrowed Funds, which shall

                                       32

be released from the Escrow Account to the Purchasers, pro rata, based upon the
principal amount of Notes purchased.

            2.6.2 Optional Redemptions. In addition to the redemption or
repurchase of the Notes required under Section 2.6.1 and Section 2.6.4, and if
there is no event of default existing under the Senior Credit Agreement and
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (Senior Debt) and OpBiz's
compliance with the provisions of Section 8.2(d) of the Senior Credit Agreement,
the Company may voluntarily redeem the outstanding principal amount of the Notes
(including PIK Interest capitalized thereto) in whole, or in part (in a minimum
amount of at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000), together with
all accrued and unpaid interest on the amount so redeemed through the date of
redemption, at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the
sum of the principal amount to be redeemed plus the prepayment premium indicated
below corresponding to the period in which the redemption occurs (such premium,
the "Prepayment Premium").

After August 9, 2010                                           None
</TABLE>

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may
redeem the Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
(including PIK Interest) at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal
amount to be redeemed plus a premium of 16% prior to August 8, 2008 if (i) the
Company uses the proceeds of a public equity offering by the Company, OpBiz (but
only to the extent there is no event of default existing under the Senior Credit
Agreement and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (Senior Debt)
and OpBiz's compliance with the provisions of Section 8.2(d) of the Senior
Credit Agreement), EquityCo and/or BH/RE to fund such redemption, and (ii) at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such redemption.

            2.6.3 Notice of Redemptions; Pro Rata Redemptions. Written notice of
any redemption pursuant to Section 2.6.1, Section 2.6.2 or Section 2.6.7 shall
be given to the Noteholders at least 30 calendar days prior to the date of any
such redemption. Each redemption of the Notes pursuant to Section 2.6 shall be
made so that all outstanding Notes then held by each holder shall be redeemed in
a principal amount (including PIK Interest) which shall bear the

                                       33
<PAGE>

same ratio to the total unpaid principal amount (including PIK Interest) being
redeemed on all such Notes as the unpaid principal amount (including PIK
Interest) of the Notes then held by such holder bears to the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of such Notes.

            2.6.4 Change of Control; Offer to Purchase. Notwithstanding any term
or provision in Section 2.6.2, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company shall furnish to each Noteholder
written notice (each a "Change of Control Notice") setting forth in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances underlying such Change of Control. The
occurrence of a Change of Control shall constitute an irrevocable offer by the
Company to repurchase all of the Notes held by the Noteholders, at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof on the
date the Change of Control occurs together with all other accrued and unpaid
interest on the amount so purchased through the date of repurchase. Following
receipt of any Change of Control Notice, each Noteholder shall advise the
Company, by written notice, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such
offer, as to whether it desires to have all or any of the Notes held by it so
repurchased (in integral multiples of $100,000), specifying the principal amount
of the Notes to be sold by it (provided that if a Noteholder accepts such offer
but does not specify an amount it wishes to receive, it will be deemed to have
elected to sell all of the Notes held by it). If a Noteholder fails to respond
to such offer by the Company within the five (5) Business Day acceptance period,
such Noteholder shall be deemed not to have accepted such offer. The Company
shall then repurchase each Note with respect to which such offer was accepted on
the date on which such Change of Control occurs.

            2.6.5 Mandatory Offer to Purchase Notes on Sale of Time Share
Premises. As soon as possible, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
prior to the sale of the Time Share Premises by the Company to any Person (other
than an Affiliate) for a cash purchase price in excess of $14,000,000 (other
than to or for the benefit of a developer that has agreed to pay to OpBiz (or to
OpBiz and the Company, in the aggregate) annual contractual minimum marketing
fees as set forth in the Development/Entertainment Side Letter), the Company
shall furnish to each Noteholder written notice setting forth in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances underlying such Disposition, including the
proposed date upon which the underlying transaction is to be consummated (each a
"Time Share Disposition Notice"). The occurrence of such sale shall constitute
an irrevocable offer by the Company to repurchase, at par, an amount of Notes
(together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon) equal to each
Noteholder's pro rata share of $14,000,000 (with all amounts not used to
repurchase the Notes to be held in escrow by the Company for future payments of
cash interest and other amounts due in respect of the Notes, provided that any
amount in excess of $14,000,000 shall be applied as required by Section 4.3(a)
of the Senior Credit Agreement), on the date that the sale of the Time Share
Premises is consummated. Following receipt of any Time Share Disposition Notice,
each Noteholder shall advise the Company, by written notice, within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such offer, as to whether it desires to have all
or any of the Notes held by it so repurchased, specifying the principal amount
of Notes to be sold by it (provided that if a Noteholder accepts such offer but
does not specify an amount it wishes to receive, it will be deemed to have
elected to sell all of the Notes held by it). If a Noteholder fails to respond
to such offer by the Company within the five (5) Business Day acceptance period,
such offer shall expire in accordance with its terms.

                                       34
<PAGE>

The Company shall then repurchase each Note with respect to which such offer was
accepted or portion thereof in accordance with this Section 2.6.5 on the date on
which the sale of the Time Share Premises occurs.

            2.6.6 Mandatory Offer to Purchase Notes Upon Release of Deed of
Trust on Time Share Premises. If the Company desires to release the Deed of
Trust on the Time Share Premises other than in connection with (y) an assignment
of the Time Share Premises to a developer that has agreed to pay OpBiz and the
Company, in the aggregate, annual contractual minimum marketing fees as set
forth in the Development/Entertainment Side Letter, or (z) a sale of the Time
Share Premises to any Person (other than an Affiliate) for a cash purchase price
in excess of $14,000,000, then the Company shall furnish to each Noteholder a
written offer to repurchase, at par, an amount of Notes (together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon) equal to each Noteholder's pro rata share
of $14,000,000 (with all amounts not used to repurchase the Notes to be held in
escrow by the Company for future payments of cash interest and other amounts due
in respect of the Notes) on the date that the Deed of Trust is released (each a
"Deed of Trust Release Notice"). Following receipt of the Deed of Trust Release
Notice, each Noteholder shall advise the Company, by written notice, within ten
(10) Business Days after receipt of such offer, as to whether it desires to have
all or any of the Notes held by it so repurchased, specifying the principal
amount of Notes to be sold by it (provided that if a Noteholder accepts such
offer but does not specify an amount it wishes to receive, it will be deemed to
have elected to sell all of the Notes held by it). If a Noteholder fails to
respond to such offer by the Company within the ten (10) Business Day acceptance
period, such offer shall expire in accordance with its terms. The Company shall
then repurchase each Note with respect to which such offer was accepted or
portion thereof in accordance with this Section 2.6.6 on the date on which the
Deed of Trust is released.

            2.6.7 Removal of Competition Restriction. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.6.2, the Company may, at any time furnish to each
Noteholder a written offer to repurchase the full amount of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes (including capitalized PIK Interest), together
with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the date of redemption at a
redemption price equal to 108% of the principal amount of the Notes (including
capitalized PIK Interest) then outstanding. Such notice shall specify an
offering period of at least ten (10) Business Days. Following receipt of any
such offer, each Noteholder shall advise the Company, by written notice, within
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such offer, as to whether it desires to
have all or any of the Notes held by it so repurchased, specifying the principal
amount of Notes to be sold by it; provided that if a Noteholder accepts such
offer but does not specify an amount it wishes to receive, it will be deemed to
have elected to sell all of the Notes held by it); provided further, that it is
understood that the Noteholders shall have no obligation to accept any such
repurchase offer. If a Noteholder fails to respond to such offer by the Company
within the ten (10) Business Day acceptance period, such offer shall expire in
accordance with its terms with respect to any such Noteholder. The Company shall
then repurchase each Note with respect to which such offer was accepted or
portion thereof in accordance with this Section 2.6.7 no later than the five (5)
Business Days after the expiration of the offer period specified in such notice.
Upon expiration of the offer period, and if applicable, completion of the
repurchase of any Notes tendered in such offer to purchase, the restrictions

                                       35
<PAGE>

contained in the penultimate sentence of Section 3.1 of the Planet Hollywood
License Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Noteholders and the
Noteholders shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any rights and remedies
under the Planet Hollywood License Agreement related to any violation of such
restrictions.

            2.6.8 Replacement of Unsuitable Securityholder. If any Gaming
Authority requires that a Securityholder be licensed, qualified or found
suitable under any applicable Gaming Law, and such Securityholder:

                  (a)   fails to apply for a license, qualification or a finding
of suitability within 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required by the
applicable Gaming Authority) after being requested to do so by such Gaming
Authority; or

                  (b)   is denied such license or qualification or not found
suitable; then such Securityholder shall have 60 days in which to sell all
Securities then held by such Securityholder and that are required by such Gaming
Authority to be sold to a Person reasonably acceptable to such Gaming Authority.
If such Securityholder does not effect such a sale within such 60 day period,
the Company shall then have the right, if required by the Gaming Authority:

                              (1)   to require each such Securityholder to
                        transfer its Securities to a transferee designated by
                        the Company and acceptable to the Gaming Authority
                        (including to any other Securityholder, any member of
                        the Investor Group or an Affiliate of any member of the
                        Investor Group), within such time period after the
                        occurrence of the event described in clause (a) or (b)
                        above as may be required or approved by the Gaming
                        Authority, or

                              (2)   to redeem the Securities then held by the
                        Securityholder.

In the event the Company exercises its right to designate a transferee pursuant
to clause (1) above or to redeem the Securities pursuant to clause (2) above,
the minimum purchase price or redemption price (as applicable) shall be: (x)
with respect to the Notes held by such Securityholder, an amount equal to the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Notes (including PIK Interest),
plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date and (y) with
respect to any Warrants and Warrant Interests then held by such Securityholder,
an amount equal to the Redemption Price or the outstanding principal and accrued
but unpaid interest on any Put Notes (as such terms are defined in the Warrant)
(determined as of the date such Securityholder was required to dispose of its
securities pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above). All consideration payable
pursuant to this Section 2.6.8 shall be paid in one installment in immediately
available funds. The provisions of Section 2.6.2 shall not apply to any
redemption effected pursuant to this Section 2.6.8.

                                       36
<PAGE>

Immediately upon a determination by a Gaming Authority that a Securityholder
will not be licensed, qualified or found suitable and must dispose of its
Securities, such Securityholder will, to the extent required by applicable
Gaming Laws, have no further right:

                              (1)   to (i) receive any dividend or interest or
                        any payment or distribution of any kind, including of
                        any share of the distribution of profits or cash or any
                        other property, or payments upon dissolution, from the
                        Company, other than a return of capital as required
                        above, (ii) exercise directly, or through any proxy,
                        trustee or nominee any voting right conferred by the
                        member's interest in the Company, (iii) participate in
                        the management of the Company or (iv) receive any
                        remuneration (other than the Redemption Price or the
                        outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on
                        any Put Notes) in any form from the Company holding a
                        Gaming License for services rendered or otherwise; or

                              (2)   to receive any interest, dividend, economic
                        interests or any other Distribution or payment with
                        respect to the Securities from the Company, except the
                        redemption prices referred to in Section (2) above.

      The applicable Securityholder shall notify the Company in writing of any
transfer or redemption pursuant to this Section 2.6.8 as soon as practicable.
Any Securityholder that is required to apply for a license, qualification or a
finding of suitability shall be responsible for all fees and costs of applying
for and obtaining the license, qualification or finding of suitability and of
any investigation by the Gaming Authority.

            2.6.9 Cancellation of Acquired Notes. The Company will promptly
cancel all Notes acquired by it pursuant to any purchase, redemption, prepayment
or tender for the Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or otherwise
and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

      2.7   Default Rate of Interest. If an Event of Default (other than under
Section 8.1(m)) has occurred and is continuing, from and after the date that the
underlying Default occurred, the entire outstanding unpaid principal balance of
the Notes (including PIK Interest) and any accrued but unpaid interest then due
and owing shall bear interest, payable on demand in cash or, if elected by the
Company, in PIK Interest, at the applicable Interest Rate plus 4% per annum, or
such lower rate as then may be the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law (the
"Default Rate"); provided, however, that immediately upon the cessation or cure
of such Event of Default, if no other Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default under Section 8.1(m)) is then continuing, the Notes shall again bear
interest at the applicable Interest Rate as set forth in Section 2.1.

                                       37
<PAGE>

      2.8   Maximum Legal Rate of Interest. Nothing in this Agreement or in the
Notes shall require the Company to pay interest at a rate in excess of the
maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law.

      2.9   Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment required to be
made under any Transaction Document shall be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
payment of interest due.

      2.10  Transfer and Exchange of Notes. The Company shall keep a register in
which it shall provide for the registration of the Notes and the registration of
transfers of Notes. The holder of any Note may, prior to maturity or prepayment
thereof, surrender such Note at the principal office of the Company for transfer
or exchange, and upon any such transfer or exchange shall notify the Company as
to the identity of the transferee. Within a reasonable time after the holder
notifies the Company in writing that it intends to transfer (or has transferred)
all or a portion of its Notes, the Company shall issue in exchange therefor
(without expense to such holder, other than transfer taxes, if any) another Note
in the same aggregate principal amount (or if requested by the holder in
denominations of $100,000 and multiples thereof, except in the case of a Note
for the balance of the aggregate amount of the Note so transferred), as of the
date of such issuance, as the unpaid principal amount of the Note so surrendered
and having the same maturity and rate of interest, containing the same
provisions and subject to the same terms and conditions as the Note so
surrendered (provided that no minimum shall apply to a liquidating distribution
of Notes to investors in a Noteholder and any Notes so distributed may be
subsequently transferred by such investor and its successors in the original
denomination thereof in compliance with the Securities Act but without further
restriction). Each new Note shall be made payable to such Person or Persons, or
assigns, as the holder of such surrendered Note may designate, and such transfer
or exchange shall be made in such a manner that no gain or loss of principal or
interest shall result therefrom. The Company shall have no obligation hereunder
or under any Note (including, without limitation, to furnish notices or
financial statements) to any Person other than the registered holder of each
such Note. The provisions of this Section 2.10 are intended to result in the
Notes being in "registered form" within the meaning of Code Section 163(f) and
Treasury Regulations Section 1.871-14(c), and shall be interpreted and applied
in conformity therewith.

      2.11  Replacement of Notes. Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the
Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note and, if
requested in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of
an indemnity bond or other agreement or security reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Note the Company will issue a new Note of like tenor and amount and
dated the date to which interest has been paid, in lieu of such lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Note; provided, however, if any Note of which a
Noteholder, its nominee, or any of its partners is the holder is lost, stolen or
destroyed, the affidavit of an authorized partner or officer of the holder
setting forth the circumstances with respect to such loss, theft or destruction
shall be accepted as satisfactory evidence thereof, and no indemnification bond
or other security shall be required as a condition to the execution and delivery
by the Company of a new Note in

                                       38
<PAGE>

replacement of such lost, stolen or destroyed Note other than the holders
written agreement to indemnify the Company.

      2.12  Ranking. The Noteholder Obligations and the rights and remedies of
the Noteholders under the Notes Documents shall be senior in right of payment to
all Subordinated Debt of the Company. The Noteholder Obligations and the rights
and remedies of the Noteholders under the Notes Documents shall be subordinate
and junior in right of payment to and enforcement of the Senior Debt in the
manner and to the extent provided in the Intercreditor Agreement (Senior Debt).

      THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, POWERS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE
SECURITYHOLDERS HEREUNDER ARE AND SHALL BE SUBJECT IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE
INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (SENIOR DEBT).

      2.13  Funding Fee. The Company hereby agrees to pay each Purchaser or its
designee a funding fee equal to 0.375% of the original principal amount of the
Notes purchased by such Purchaser at Funding (the "Funding Fee"), and such fee
shall be in addition to (i) the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section
3.1.2 (x) and (ii) the signing fee of to 0.375% of the aggregate original
principal amount of the Notes previously paid to the Purchasers (the "Signing
Fee") (provided that the Signing Fee shall be refunded in whole to the Company
if the Funding Date does not occur (other than by reason of an action or
inaction by the Company or its Affiliates (including failure of the Company or
an Affiliate to obtain any required Gaming License)). At the option of any
Purchaser by prior written notice to the Company, the Funding Fee may be paid to
such Purchaser by deducting such fee from the purchase price of the Notes and
Warrants.

             ARTICLE III - CONDITIONS TO THE PURCHASERS' OBLIGATIONS

      3.1   Conditions to Funding. The obligation of the Purchasers to purchase

      9.6   Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Company agrees to pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Noteholders (including reasonable legal
fees of one general legal counsel to the Noteholders and one Nevada counsel to
the Noteholders) in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Securities, the other Securities Purchase Documents and
other instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder, and in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as
well as all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Noteholders in connection with the amendment, waiver (whether or not such
amendment or waiver becomes effective) or enforcement of this Agreement, the
Notes, the other Securities Purchase Documents, and other instruments and
documents to be delivered hereunder and thereunder. In addition, the Company
agrees to pay (a) any and all stamp and other similar Taxes (expressly excluding
income and capital gain taxes) payable or determined to be payable by any
Noteholder in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Securities, the other Securities Purchase Documents, and the other instruments
and documents to be delivered hereunder or thereunder, (b) the expenses of
preparing Notes from time to time in connection with exchanges and transfers of
Notes, and (c) the expenses of delivering copies of Transaction Documents to
Noteholders. It is acknowledged that a $150,000 retainer has been provided to
the Purchasers to be applied to such fees and expenses. On each of the Funding
Date and the Closing Date, the Company shall reimburse the Purchasers for their
reasonable fees and expenses incurred and unpaid as of such date (it being
understood that the requirement to make such payments on such dates shall not,
in any case, limit the obligations of the Company to reimburse the Purchasers
for all of their reasonable fees and expenses, as described in the preceding
sentence).

      9.7   Assignability; Binding Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned
by the Company without the prior written consent of each other party hereto;
provided, however, that any Noteholder may assign this Agreement freely without
the consent of the Company if such assignor agrees to be bound by all the
obligations of a Noteholder hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and no others. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement is intended to give any Person not named
herein the benefit of any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this
Agreement.

      9.8   Payments in Respect of Notes. Each Noteholder and any successor
holder of the Notes by their acceptance thereof, agree that, except with respect
to any payments made to such Noteholder or successor holder of the Notes
pursuant to Section 2.5(b), Section 2.6.4, Section

                                       79
<PAGE>

2.6.5, Section 2.6.6 or Section 2.6.7 with respect to all sums received by them
applicable to the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes equitable
adjustment will be made among them so that, in effect, all such sums shall be
shared ratably by all of the Noteholders whether received by voluntary payment,
by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of set off, by
counterclaim or cross-action or by the enforcement of any or all of the Notes.
If any holder of the Notes receives any such payment on its Notes in excess of
its pro rata portion, then such holder receiving such excess payment shall
purchase for cash from the other holders an interest in their Notes in such
amounts as shall result in a ratable participation by all of the holders in the
aggregate unpaid amount of Notes then outstanding. The Company shall not have
any obligation to any Person under this Section 9.8.

      9.9   Indemnification. In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to
Section 9.6, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be consummated, the Company and OpBiz agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify, pay and hold each Noteholder and the partners, members, officers,
directors, employees, beneficiaries, customers, attorneys and agents of each
Noteholder (collectively, the "Indemnitees") harmless from and against, any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for such Indemnitees in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be
designated a party thereto), which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this
Agreement, the Securities, and the other Transaction Documents (other than the
Senior Credit Documents) and all other matters related thereto or in connection
therewith, (ii) the Noteholders' agreement to purchase the Notes and the
Warrants, or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Notes and the
Warrants hereunder, (iii) the violation of any securities law by the Company in
connection with or otherwise affecting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless the violation resulted from a breach by such Noteholder of its
representations contained in Article V, (iv) the failure of any of the parties
(other than the Noteholders) to the Transaction Documents to comply with any
law, rule or regulation applicable to the transactions contemplated thereby or
(v) any Environmental Law, or any Hazardous Substances (A) present on or under
the Premises (B) released from or onto the Premises, or (C) generated by the
Company (the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that the Company shall have no
obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with respect to (a) Indemnified
Liabilities which are determined by a final court decision or arbitral award to
have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee
or (b) any intentional violation of the Gaming Laws by a Noteholder. To the
extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in the
preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law or public
policy, the Company shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted
to pay and satisfy under Applicable Law, to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them. The
provisions of this Section 9.9 will survive the termination of this Agreement
and the repayment of the Note Obligations unless otherwise agreed in writing by
the Company and each affected Noteholder.

      9.10  Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made to the Noteholders in this Agreement, the Notes, the Securities
Purchase Documents or any other instrument or document delivered in connection
herewith or therewith, shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
thereof, acceptance of the Notes, the Warrants and the Warrant Interests,
payment of the Notes or upon redemption, prepayment or otherwise, exercise of
the Warrants or termination of this Agreement, regardless of any investigation
made by the Noteholders or on behalf of the Noteholders.

      9.11  Prior Agreements. This Agreement, the other Securities Purchase
Documents, the Development/Entertainment Side Letter and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede the
Term Sheet and any prior understandings or agreements concerning the subject
matter hereof or thereof.

      9.12  Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
hereof shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision.

      9.13  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, matters of law in this Agreement that are related to gaming in Nevada
shall be governed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act (NRS Chapter 463) and the
regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission as enforced by the State Gaming
Control Board in their current form and as they may hereafter be amended from
time to time.

      9.14  Dispute Resolution. Each party hereto hereby agrees as follows:

                  (a)   All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the other Securities Purchase Documents
(other than the Security Documents, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreements and the Escrow Agreement) or any agreement or document executed and
delivered as contemplated by any of them or the negotiation, breach,
termination, validity or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved
solely and exclusively by binding arbitration to be conducted before
J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. or its successor. The arbitration shall be held in Las
Vegas, Nevada before a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules and regulations promulgated by J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. unless
specifically modified herein.

                  (b)   The parties covenant and agree that the arbitration
hearing shall commence within twenty (20) days of the date on which a written
demand for arbitration is filed by any party hereto. In connection with the
arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the power to order the
production of documents by each party and any third-party witnesses. In
addition, each party may take up to three (3) depositions as of right, and the
arbitrator may in his or her discretion allow additional depositions upon good
cause shown by the moving party. However, the arbitrator shall not have the
power to order the answering of interrogatories or the response to requests for
admission. In connection with any arbitration, each party shall provide to the
other, no later than ten (10) Business Days before the date of the arbitration,
the identity of all Persons that may testify at the arbitration and a copy of
all documents that may be

                                       81
<PAGE>

introduced at the arbitration or considered or used by a party's witness or
expert, and a summary of the expert's opinions and the basis for said opinions.
The arbitrator's decision and award shall be made and delivered within ten (10)
days of the conclusion of the arbitration. The arbitrator's decision shall set
forth a reasoned basis for any award of damages or finding of liability. The
arbitrator shall not award punitive damages or any other damages that are
specifically excluded under the Securities Purchase Documents, and each party
hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages.

                  (c)   The parties covenant and agree that they will
participate in the arbitration in good faith and, except as set forth below,
shall (i) bear their own attorneys' fees costs and expenses in connection with
the arbitration, and (ii) share equally in the fees and expenses charged by
J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. The arbitrator may in his or her discretion assess
costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the
prevailing party) against any party to a proceeding. Any party unsuccessfully
refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators shall be liable for costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the other party in
enforcing the award. This Agreement applies equally to requests for temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, except that in the case of temporary
or preliminary injunctive relief any party may proceed in court without prior
arbitration for the limited purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm.
The dispute resolution provisions of this Section 9.14 shall be enforceable in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (d)   Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of J.A.M.S./Endispute,
Inc. to resolve all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating
to this Agreement and the other Securities Purchase Documents (other than the
Security Documents, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreements and
the Escrow Agreement) or the negotiation, breach, termination, validity or
performance hereof and or the transactions contemplated hereby and further
consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California for the
purposes of enforcing the arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Each party
further irrevocably waives any objection to proceeding before
J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or to improper
venue and further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to make
a claim in any court that arbitration before J.A.M.S./Endispute, Inc. has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
service of process by registered mail at the address to which notices are to be
given. Each of the parties hereto agrees that its or his submission to
jurisdiction and its or his consent to service of process by mail are made for
the express benefit of the other parties hereto. The provisions of this Section
9.14 will survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment of the
Note Obligations unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and each
affected Noteholder.

<PAGE>

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions
of this Agreement and the agreements, documents and instruments executed and
delivered in connection herewith.

      9.16  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
taken to be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one

executed counterpart of this Agreement.

      9.17  [Intentionally Omitted].

      9.18  Consent to Jurisdiction. Except as provided in Section 9.14 above,
the Company and each Noteholder irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of arbitration in Las Vegas, Nevada to resolve all disputes, claims
or controversies arising out of or relating to (i) this Agreement or any other
agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the negotiation,
validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, or (ii) the Notes, and further consents to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California for the purposes
of enforcing the arbitration provisions of Section 9.14 of this Agreement. Each
party further irrevocably waives any objection to proceeding before the
arbitrator in Las Vegas, Nevada based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or to
the laying of venue and further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and
agrees not to make a claim in any court that arbitration before the arbitrator
in Las Vegas, Nevada has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the
parties hereto hereby consents to service of process by registered mail at the
address to which notices are to be given. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
its or his submission to jurisdiction and its or his consent to service of
process by mail is made for the express benefit of the other parties hereto.

      9.19  Effect of Judgment. The Company and each Noteholder agree, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that a judgment in
any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 9.18 brought
in any such court shall, subject to such rights of appeal on issues as may be
available, be conclusive and binding upon the Company or such Noteholder and may
be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of
California (or any other courts to the jurisdiction of which the Company or such
Noteholder is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment.

      9.20  No Limitation. Nothing in Section 9.18 or 9.19, shall affect the
right of the Company or any Noteholder to serve process in any manner permitted
by law, or limit any right that the Company or any Noteholder may have to bring
proceedings against the other in the courts of any jurisdiction or to enforce in
any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other
jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

      9.21  Specific Performance. Upon breach or default by the Company with
respect to any obligation hereunder or under the Notes Documents, each
Noteholder shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights at law, or in
equity or by other appropriate proceedings for specific performance of such
obligation, or for an injunction against such breach or default, or in aid of
the exercise of any power or remedy granted hereby or thereby or by law.

      9.22  Actions by Noteholders. Except as provided in Section 9.2, wherever
in this Agreement action is required or permitted to be taken by, or consent is
required of, or a matter requires the satisfaction of, the Noteholders, such
action may be taken by, and/or such consent may be obtained from, and/or such
satisfaction may be expressed by, the Majority Holders; provided, however that
any Notes acquired by the Investor Group or their Affiliates or Associates shall
be not be entitled to vote in respect of any matter.

      9.23  Non-Disclosure. Each Securityholder covenants and agrees that it and
any of its Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, managers, directors, and
each of their respective employees, attorneys, advisors and other
representatives (each a "Securityholder Party") shall hold in strict confidence

in any manner other than pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Securities Purchase Documents, any confidential,
proprietary or material non-public information obtained from the Company, any
Subsidiary, any member of the Investor Group or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or from any other Securityholder in connection with
this Agreement or any Securities Purchase Document (collectively, "Confidential
Information"); provided that information generally known in the gaming industry

Information hereunder. Each Securityholder shall not, and shall cause each
Securityholder Party not to, disclose any Confidential Information obtained by
such Person; provided, however, each Securityholder may disclose such
Confidential Information (a) to its examiners, Affiliates (including partners,
members and other investors in such Securityholder), outside auditors, counsel
and other professional advisors, (b) to any Securityholder or to any prospective
holder of Securities that is not a Competitor, provided that such prospective
holder is obligated to maintain the confidentiality thereof, (c) as required or
requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to
legal process and (d) to protect, enforce or define such Securityholder's rights
with respect to the Noteholder Obligations (but not to a Competitor). In no
event shall any Securityholder be obligated to return any materials furnished by
the Company.

hereto shall issue a publicity release or announcement or otherwise make any
