                                   ***********

               (b)    Increase in Committed Amount. The Borrower shall have the
        right, upon at least ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice to the
        Agent, to effectuate a one-time increase of up to $5,000,000 in the

               that expressly relate to an earlier date);

                      (3) on or before the date on which such Committed Amount
               increase is to become effective, the Agent shall have received,
               for its own account, the mutually acceptable fees and expenses
               required by separate agreement of the Borrower and the Agent to
               be paid in connection with such increase;

                      (4) such Committed Amount increase shall in no event be
               less than the entire $5,000,000 permitted hereby.

                      (5) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Agent a

                      (6) such requested Committed Amount increase shall be
               effective on such date only to the extent that, on or before such
               date, the Agent shall have received and accepted from one or more
               institutions reasonably acceptable to the Agent and, with respect
               to any institution that is not at such time a Lender hereunder,
               reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, an agreement in the form
               of Exhibit 3.4(b) hereto (each such agreement a "New Commitment
               Agreement"), with respect to the increase in the Committed
               Amount.

               Any such increase in the Committed Amount shall not apply to the
               Commitment
