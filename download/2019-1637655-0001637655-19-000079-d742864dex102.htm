case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by the applicable recipient of interest with respect to the Canadian Facility Obligations at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as
follows: (i)&nbsp;first, by reducing the amount or rates of interest required to be paid by the Canadian Domiciled Obligors to the applicable recipient under the Loan Documents; and (ii)&nbsp;thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums
and other amounts required to be paid by the Canadian Domiciled Obligors to the applicable recipient which would constitute interest with respect to the Canadian Facility Obligations for purposes of Section&nbsp;347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if the applicable recipient shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by that section of the Criminal Code (Canada), then Canadian
Domiciled Obligors shall be entitled, by notice in writing to Agent, to obtain reimbursement from the applicable recipient in an amount equal to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by the
applicable recipient to the applicable Canadian Domiciled Obligor. Any amount or rate of interest with respect to the Canadian Facility Obligations referred to in this <B>Section&nbsp;3.10</B> shall be determined in accordance with generally
accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that any Canadian Revolver Loan to Canadian Borrower remains outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the
meaning of &#147;interest&#148; (as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be prorated over that period of time and otherwise be prorated over the period from the Closing Date to the date of Full
Payment of the Canadian Facility Obligations, and, in the event of a dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of such determination. </P>

after such time shall be deemed made on the next Business Day. Any payment of an Interest Period Loan prior to the end of its Interest Period shall be accompanied by all amounts due under <B>Section&nbsp;3.9</B>. Borrowers agree that Agent shall
have the continuing, exclusive right to apply and reapply payments and proceeds of Collateral against the Obligations, in such manner as Agent deems advisable (so long as such application or reapplication could not reasonably be expected to result
in material adverse tax consequences to an Obligor or a Subsidiary of an Obligor under Section&nbsp;956 of the Code), but whenever possible, any prepayment of Loans shall be applied first to Floating Rate Loans and then to Interest Period Loans. All
payments with respect to any Obligation shall be made in the currency of the underlying Obligation. Any payment made contrary to the requirements of the preceding sentence shall be subject to the terms of <B>Section&nbsp;5.11</B>. If any payment
under the Loan Documents shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, the due date shall be extended to the next Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in any computation of interest and fees. </P>
