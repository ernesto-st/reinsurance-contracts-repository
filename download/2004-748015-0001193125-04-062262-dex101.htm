(or Non-U.S. Participant), in its good faith judgment, is eligible for an exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such
amounts payable to such Non-U.S. Lender (or Non-U.S. Participant) if such Non-U.S. Lender (or Non-U.S. Participant) fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of Section 5.4. The Canadian Borrower shall not be required to indemnify or
pay any additional amounts to any Lender in respect of Canadian withholding tax pursuant to this Section 13.3 to the extent that such taxes result from a failure by the Lender to comply with any Reporting Requirement described in Section 5.4(c) of
this Agreement if (i) compliance is required by law, regulation, administrative practice or any applicable tax treaty as a precondition to exemption from or a reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of tax, and (ii) the Canadian borrower
has first made written request to the Lender that such Lender comply with the particular Reporting Requirement (identified specifically in such request) and the Lender has not complied with such Reporting Requirement within 30 Business Days of such
written request; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U> that the Canadian Borrower shall not be relieved of its obligation to indemnify or pay additional amounts to a Lender (x) where such obligation arose prior to the Canadian Borrower&#146;s written
request to the Lender respecting such Reporting Requirement, (y) if, by reason of any change in any law, regulation, administrative practice or applicable tax treaty occurring after the date hereof, the Lender, as applicable, is unable to duly
comply with such Reporting Requirement, or (z) to the extent that the additional payment or indemnity compensates the Lender for an amount to which the Lender would have been entitled to received under this Section 13.3 had the Lender complied with
the Reporting Requirement. Upon a CAM Exchange, a Lender (or Participant) will use commercially reasonable efforts, and complete any procedural formalities necessary, to become an Eligible Lender with respect to the Canadian Borrower and, if such
Lender (or Participant) fails to do so, the Canadian Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to such Lender (or Participant) (unless such Lender is prohibited from becoming a Canadian Lender by its governing documents).
If the Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, fails to pay any such Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, such Borrower or Canadian Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Participants for any incremental taxes, interest, costs or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lenders or such
Participants as a result of any such failure. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">SECTION 14.
