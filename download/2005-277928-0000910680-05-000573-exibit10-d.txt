         parties prior to the expiration of the term.

(b)      Existing  Purchase  Orders  Continue.  The termination or expiration of

                  additional differentiating factors; and

                  2. This Agreement and all applicable Orders shall be deemed to
                  be  automatically  amended,  effective  retroactively  to  the

8.       PURCHASE  ORDERS;   CANCELLATION  OF  PURCHASE  ORDERS,  REVOCATION  OF
         ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

(a)      An Order may be mailed,  sent by facsimile  transmission  or electronic
         data interchange  (EDI).  Prior to initiating an EDI  transaction,  the
         parties will execute an EDI Trading  Agreement which will set forth the
         terms and  conditions of EDI  transactions  (attached as ATTACHMENT E-1
         hereof entitled "ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI)").

(b)      Seller shall be obligated to acknowledge Orders within ten (10) days of
         receipt, without conditioning such acknowledgement on the acceptance by
         Customer  of any terms  inconsistent  with or in  addition to those set
         forth in this Agreement.  Upon  acknowledgement,  the Order and related
         acknowledgement  shall  constitute a binding  contract for the purchase
         and sale of the applicable  Product  governed by the provisions of this
         Agreement, as such provisions may be modified as provided herein.

(c)      Seller may  enforce  each Order only  against  the  Affiliate  that has
         submitted the Order. Default by an Affiliate shall not affect any other
         Affiliate party to this Agreement.

(d)      If an  Affiliate  shall  be in  material  breach  or  default  of  this
         Agreement,  including,  but not limited to, timely  payment for Product
         purchased  and such breach  shall  continue for a period of thirty (30)
         days after receipt of Seller's written notice, then, in addition to all
         other rights and remedies of law or equity or  otherwise,  Seller shall
         have the right to suspend delivery of Product on outstanding  Orders or
         revoke existing acknowledgements only with respect to such Affiliate.

(e)      If Seller shall be in material breach or default of this Agreement, and
         such  breach  shall  continue  for a period of thirty  (30) days  after
         Seller's  receipt  of  Customer's  written  notice  thereof,  then,  in
         addition  to  all  other  rights  and  remedies  of law  or  equity  or
         otherwise,  Customer  shall  have the right to  immediately  cancel all
         applicable  Orders  without any  obligation  or liability to Seller for
         said  cancellation.  However,  if Seller  fails to tender  delivery  of
         Product on the respective  date agreed upon or as set forth in Seller's
         acknowledgement,  then  Customer  shall  have the right to  immediately
         cancel all applicable Orders without further obligation or liability to
         Seller for said cancellation with the exception of Seller's inventories
         of Product  which are private  labeled for  Customer  and not  saleable
         elsewhere,  or any  obligation to provide  Seller a time period to cure
         said breach.

(f)      Unless  specified  otherwise  in  an  Exhibit  or  Attachment  to  this
         Agreement,  Customer may reschedule Orders for convenience, in whole or
         in part, without  obligation or liability,  by providing written notice
         to Seller at least ten (10) days before  scheduled ship date of Product
         or date Service is to be rendered.

(g)      Existing  Purchase  Orders  Continue.  The termination or expiration of
         this Agreement  shall not affect the obligations of either party to the
         other under  existing  Purchase  Orders (POs)  issued  pursuant to this
         Agreement  (except to the extent  orders are  terminated or modified in
         accordance with the Section entitled "PURCHASE  ORDERS"),  but such POs
         shall continue in effect as if this Agreement had not been ended.

(h)      Change Order.  Customer may, by issuing a written document labeled as a
         "Change  Order",  make  changes  to a PO. If any change  required  by a
         Change  Order alters the value of the  Products  ordered,  Seller shall
         promptly notify Customer and Seller shall adjust the price accordingly.
         If the  amount  of  the  price  adjustment  is not  specified  in  this
         Agreement,  then  the  amount  of any  change  in price  caused  by the
         adjustment  may be no greater  than  Seller's  reasonable  documentable
         increased costs and expenses. Seller shall notify Customer within three
         (3) business  days of Seller's  receipt of a Change Order if the Change
         Order will cause an increase in price. Customer may, at its discretion,
         agree to the changed price or withdraw the underlying Change Order.

(a)      Payment Due Date. Payment for Product shall be due 30 days from date of
         receipt of goods, or receipt of an undisputed invoice, whichever occurs

(b)      Disputed  Invoices,  Right of Set Off. If Customer  disputes all or any
         portion of an invoice,  it shall be required to pay only the amount not
         in dispute.  Customer  shall be  entitled to set off any amount  Seller
         owes it against  amounts  payable  under  this or any other  Agreement.
         Payment  by  Customer  shall not  result in waiver of any of its rights
         under this Agreement. Customer shall not be obligated to pay Seller for
         Services that are not fully and properly invoiced.

(c)      Invoices For Charges Specified in an Order.  Seller shall not issue and
         invoice for Product  prior to shipment of such  Product.  Invoices  for

         limited to, (i) Order  number;  (ii) Order line number;  (iii)  Product

         of all invoices, all amounts billable to and payments made by Customer,

         purposes of audit during normal  business hours during the term of this
         agreement and during the respective periods in which Seller is required

         stocks, Seller shall be given an adequate period of time, not to exceed
         90 days,  to  replenish  said  stock.  During the last  quarter of this
         Agreement term,  Seller will be required to discontinue  production and
         deplete  the  inventory  down to zero  unless  specifically  authorized

         efforts to provide the Products in an expeditious manner as outlined in

         agrees  to  indemnify  and  defend  Customer  for  any  losses,  fines,
         reasonable  attorney  fees, or other  penalties that may be incurred or
         assessed  upon  Customer  due to  Seller's  failure to comply  with the
         provisions  of the  Title  I of the ADA  with  respect  to the  persons

         Regulations  as they may be  amended  from  time to time  ("Part  68"),

         non-compliance  with Part 68. Customer agrees to promptly notify Seller
         of any liability,  claim or demand against Customer for which Seller is
         responsible  under this clause and gives  Seller full  opportunity  and
         authority to assume the defense,  including appeals, and to settle such
         liability,  claims and demands,  provided  that if Customer  reasonably
         believes  that  Seller  is not  adequately  handling  such  defense  or
         settlement,  Customer  reserves  the right to  assume  the  defense  or
         settlement.

         purchase,  and require the delayed party to resume  performance of such
         purchase  order  once  the  Condition  ceases,  with an  option  in the
         affected  party to extend the period of this Agreement up to the length
         of time the Condition endured.

                  forth in EXHIBIT D hereof entitled "PURCHASE FOR INTERNAL USE,
                  WARRANTY AND PRODUCT SUPPORT" Seller agrees,  in any event, if
                  any natural or other  disaster or  emergency  causes an out of
                  service  condition,  Seller shall use extraordinary  effort to
                  locate or provide (i.e.  procure or  manufacture)  and ship to

                  expiration  of this  Agreement or survival of the  technology,
                  whichever is greater.

          (3)     Charges  for  replacement  Product  shall  be  at  the  prices

                  abnormal  demand  for  Products  under this  Agreement  at the
                  prices  listed  herein,  plus  any  additional   extraordinary
                  support costs incurred to assist Customer in restoring service
                  which has been disrupted  because of  catastrophic  conditions

         this  Agreement or a PO issued  pursuant to this  Agreement  (excepting
         moneys due or to become due) or delegate  any work or other  obligation
         owed by Seller under this Agreement without first obtaining the written
         permission  of  Customer,   which  Customer  may  refuse  in  its  sole
         discretion.  Any attempted assignment or delegation in contravention of
         this section  shall be void and  ineffective.  Any  assignment of money

         assignment attempts to impose upon Customer obligations to the assignee
         in addition to the payment of such monies,  or preclude  Customer  from
         dealing  solely and directly  with Seller in all matters  pertaining to
         the  Agreement  including,  but not  limited  to,  the  negotiation  of
         amendments or the settlement of charges due.

(b)      Customer  Assignment.  Customer  may freely  assign all or part of this
         Agreement.

24.      TAXES

(a)      The Seller and Customer  acknowledge  and agree that it is their mutual
         objective and intent to legally minimize,  to the extent feasible,  the
         aggregate  Federal,  state or local tax with respect to the products or
         related services being purchased under this Agreement.

(b)      With respect to any purchase products or services under this Agreement,
         if any Federal, state or local tax excluding any tax levied on property
         or income (a "Tax") is required by applicable  law to be collected from
         Customer by Seller,  then (i) Seller will bill, as a separately  stated
         item,  Customer for such Tax,  (ii) Customer will timely remit such Tax
         to Seller, and (iii) Seller will timely remit such collected Tax to the
         applicable taxing authority.

(c)      If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other  governmental
         entity the other Party agrees to  reasonably  cooperate  with the Party
         being  audited in order to respond to any audit  inquiries  in a proper
         and timely  manner so that the audit and/or any  resulting  controversy
         may be resolved expeditiously.

(d)      If applicable law places the  responsibility on Seller to collect a Tax
         from  Customer  and  Seller  fails  to do  so,  Customer  will  not  be
         responsible  for any interest or  penalties  associated  with  Seller's
         failure to collect such Tax.  Furthermore,  Seller shall not bill a Tax
         to Customer on products or services under this Agreement  which are, by
         law, not taxable.

(e)      If an exemption  procedure  is  available,  such as a resale  exemption
         certificate,  and Customer  complies with such  procedure,  then Seller
         will not bill or collect  such Tax during the  effective  period of the
         exemption.

(f)      Customer's Purchase Order may provide Seller additional tax instruction
         as  allowed by law  including,  but not  limited  to,  Customer's  self
         accrual  and  payment  of  taxes,   temporary  storage,   research  and
         development and/or other special jurisdictional exemptions.

(g)      Seller will be responsible for personal property or ad valorem taxes on
         property  owned by Seller and  Customer  will be  responsible  for such
         taxes on property  owned by  Customer.  Each Party is  responsible  for
         properly reporting owned property and neither Party will be responsible
         for either  reporting or paying  personal  property or ad valorem taxes
         owed by the other Party.

         to its facilities in connection with the work.  Reasonable prior notice
         shall be given when access is required.

(c)      If  Seller  is  given  access,   whether   on-site  or  through  remote
         facilities,  to any Customer computer or electronic data storage system
         in  order  for  Seller  to  accomplish  the  work  called  for in  this
         Agreement,  Seller  shall  limit such  access and use solely to perform

         toxic or  hazardous  materials  onto any  premises  of  Customer or its
         Affiliate  without the  permission  of  Customer,  and Seller  shall be
         responsible  for  removing  any such toxic or  hazardous  materials  in
         accordance  with all relevant  laws,  section 34 entitled "NO HAZARDOUS

         performance.  The foregoing  indemnification shall apply whether Seller
         or an indemnified party defends such claim and whether the claim arises
         or is alleged to arise out of the sole acts or  omissions of the Seller
         (and/or any  subcontractor  of Seller) or out of the concurrent acts or
         omissions  of Seller  (and/or  any  subcontractor  of  Seller)  and any
         indemnified  parties.  Seller further agrees to bind its subcontractors

         benefit act.

(c)      Notices.  Customer  will  provide  Seller  with  written  notice of any
         written claim covered by this  indemnification  and will cooperate with

         shall defend any indemnified party, at the indemnified party's request,
         against any claim. Promptly after receipt of such request, Seller shall
         assume the defense of such claim with counsel  reasonably  satisfactory
         to the  indemnified  party.  Seller shall not settle or compromise  any
         such claim or consent to the entry of any  judgment  without  the prior
         written consent of each indemnified  party and without an unconditional
         release of all claims by each  claimant or  plaintiff  in favor of each
         indemnified party.

         good faith to resolve any Dispute  arising  under this  Agreement.  The
         parties  intend that these  negotiations  be  conducted  by  nonlawyer,
         business  representatives.   The  discussions  shall  be  left  to  the
         discretion of the representatives.  Upon agreement, the representatives
         may utilize other  alternative  dispute  resolution  procedures such as
         mediation to assist in the negotiations. Discussions and correspondence
         among the  representatives  for purposes of these negotiations shall be
         treated  as   confidential   information   developed  for  purposes  of
         settlement,  shall be exempt from discovery and  production,  and shall
         not be  admissible  in  any  lawsuit  without  the  concurrence  of all
         parties.  Documents identified in or provided with such communications,
         which are not  prepared for  purposes of the  negotiations,  are not so
         exempted and may, if otherwise  admissible,  be admitted in evidence in
         the lawsuit.

(c)      Remedies  At Law or Equity.  If the  negotiations  do not  resolve  the
         Dispute  within  sixty (60) days of the initial  written  request,  the
         parties may pursue their available remedies in law or equity.

The names of certain GTE  Affiliated  Business Units are in the process of being
changed  as a  result  of  the  merger  of GTE  Corporation  and  Bell  Atlantic
Corporation.  The legal entities  themselves  have not changed under the merger.
The only  change  is  either  in the  name of the  company  or a  change  in the
doing-business-as (d/b/a) name. For ease of reference, where not obvious as from
a  d/b/a,  the name by which a  Verizon  company  was  formerly  known  has been
included in parenthesis (f/k/a). That f/k/a is not part of the legal name.

required  to  develop a  written  Corrective  Action  Plan,  within a  specified
timeframe as stated by the Customer. If within a mutually agreed upon timeframe,
the Corrective Action Plan has not led to an acceptable  improvement of the said
elements (to a grade of "B" or above),  then the Customer may exercise  remedies
as set forth in this Agreement.

If, based upon the monthly data collected for the  Customer's  eRC process,  the
Seller fails to maintain a total grade of "B" or above for three (3) consecutive
months,  the Customer  may, in addition to other  rights  under this  Agreement,
terminate  such as  specified  in the  TERMINATION  FOR CAUSE  provision of this

Leader  (SQL).  This  plan  will  assess  internal  development  data and  field
performance  data  used to  improve  Seller's  performance.  Metric  collection,
analysis  and  reporting  should be conducted  on a continual  basis.  Both file
performance and in-process data shall be utilized.

         All information,  including,  but is not limited to, plans,  procedures
and results, in Seller's QIP shall be made available for monthly review.
