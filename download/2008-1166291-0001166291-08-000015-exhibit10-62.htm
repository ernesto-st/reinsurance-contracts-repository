      such funds are returned by 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) (or, if returned
      after
      such time on such date, to but excluding the next Business Day), at a rate
      per
      annum equal to the Applicable Rate, plus Break Amount (determined as if the

      had been advanced as of the scheduled Closing Date). If the Borrower has
      designated a delayed Closing Date pursuant to this Section and the Closing
      occurs on such delayed Closing Date, the Loan shall accrue interest at the

      as a result of the proposed lease and without giving effect to any other
      activity of the Indenture Trustee or such Certificate Holder, unless the only
      result of such registration or qualification is a Tax or cost that the Borrower
      is indemnifying such party against; (2)&#160;that the Indenture Trustee&#8217;s Lien
      on the leased equipment will be recognized under the laws of such country;
      (3)&#160;the laws of such country of domicile require fair compensation by the
      government of such jurisdiction payable in a currency freely convertible into
      Dollars for the loss of the title to the leased equipment in the event of the
      requisition by such government of title (unless the Borrower shall provide
      insurance covering the risk of requisition of title to the leased equipment
      by
      the government of such jurisdiction so long as the leased equipment is subject

      that its rights under the Lease are subject and subordinate to all of the terms
      of this Trust Indenture is enforceable against such non-U.S. Air Carrier under
      applicable law (subject only to customary exceptions to enforceability); and
      (5)&#160;there exist no possessory rights in favor of such Lessee under the laws
      of such jurisdiction which would, upon bankruptcy of the Borrower or other
      default by the Borrower or Lessee and assuming that at such time such Lessee
