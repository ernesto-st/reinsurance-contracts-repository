<PAGE>


        LEASE PERIOD                               MONTHLY RENTAL AMOUNT*
        ------------                               ---------------------

        (CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED)

        *The above base rent is  expressed in January 1999
        U.S.  dollars and will  increase in the  following
        amounts   for   the    following    periods   (the
        "MANUFACTURER'S ESCALATION RATE"):

        PERIOD                              ESCALATION FACTOR
        ------------                               ---------------------

        (CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED)



                       Any  increases  to the above  base Rent  during the Lease
                       Term will be calculated immediately prior to Delivery.

5.3.2           The first  payment  of Rent  during  the Lease Term will be paid
                prior to the Scheduled Delivery Date. Each subsequent payment of
                Rent will be due monthly  thereafter  no later than the same day
                of the month as the Delivery  Date of the Aircraft  except that,
                if such day is not a Business  Day,  the Rent will be due on the
                immediately  preceding Business Day. If Delivery occurred on the

<PAGE>


or to such  other  bank  account  in the U.S.  as  LESSOR  may from time to time
designate by written notice ("LESSOR'S  BANK").  When it is stated in this Lease
that an  installment  of the  Security  Deposit,  the monthly  Rent or any other
payment is due or must be paid or made by LESSEE by a specific  date,  then such
payment  actually  must be received by LESSOR's  Bank on or before such specific
date, even if, in order for such payment to be received by LESSOR's Bank by such
specific  date,  LESSEE must initiate the wire  transfer  prior to such specific
date.

5.5 DEFAULT  INTEREST.  If LESSOR's  Bank does not receive the Rent or any other
amount on or before the  specific  date when due,  LESSOR  will  suffer loss and
damage the exact  nature  and amount of which are  difficult  or  impossible  to
ascertain.  LESSEE  will pay  LESSOR  as  supplemental  Rent  (by way of  agreed
compensation  and not as a  penalty)  interest  on any due  and  unpaid  amounts
payable by LESSEE under this Lease.  Interest  will be calculated at a per annum
rate  (based on a 360 day year)  which is equal to three  percent  (3%) plus the
Prime Rate in effect on the date on which the amount was  originally due for the
period from the date the amount  originally  was due through the date the amount
actually is received at LESSOR's Bank or, in the case of LESSOR's performance of
LESSEE's obligations  hereunder,  from the date of payment by LESSOR through the
date of LESSEE's repayment to LESSOR ("DEFAULT INTEREST"). Default Interest will
accrue on a day-to-day basis and be compounded monthly.

5.6 NO  DEDUCTIONS  OR  WITHHOLDINGS.  All  payments by LESSEE under this Lease,
including the Security Deposit,  Transaction Fee, Rent, Default Interest,  fees,
indemnities  or any other item,  will be made in full  without any  deduction or
withholding  whether in respect of set-off,  counterclaim,  duties, or Taxes (as
defined in Article 15) imposed in the State of Registration or any  jurisdiction
from which such  payments are made unless LESSEE is prohibited by Law from doing
so, in which event  LESSEE  will gross up the  payment  amount such that the net
payment received by LESSOR after any deduction or withholding equals the amounts
called for under this Lease. LESSEE's requirement to pay the amounts required by
this Article 5.6 is subject to the exceptions provided in Article 15.2.

     5.7 VALUE ADDED TAXES.  The Rent and other amounts  payable by LESSEE under
this Lease are exclusive of any value added tax, turnover tax
or similar tax or duty.

     5.8 NET LEASE.


     5.8.1 This  Lease is a net lease and  LESSEE's  obligation  to pay Rent and
make  other  payments  in  accordance  with  this  Lease  will be  absolute  and
unconditional  under any and all  circumstances  and regardless of other events,
including the following:

     (a) any right of set-off, counterclaim,  recoupment, defense or other right
(including  any right of  reimbursement)  which LESSEE may have against  LESSOR,
Manufacturer,  the  Engine  manufacturer  or any other  person  for any  reason,
including any claim LESSEE may have for the foregoing;



<PAGE>


     (b)  unavailability  or interruption in use of the Aircraft for any reason,
including a requisition thereof or any prohibition or interference with or other
restriction  against  LESSEE's  use,  operation  or  possession  of the Aircraft
(whether   by  Law  or   otherwise),   any   defect  in  title,   airworthiness,
merchantability,  fitness for any purpose, condition,  design,  specification or
operation  of any kind or  nature  of the  Aircraft,  the  ineligibility  of the
Aircraft for any particular use or trade or for  registration  under the Laws of
any jurisdiction or Total Loss of the Aircraft;

     (c) insolvency, bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,  readjustment of
debt,  dissolution,   liquidation,   receivership,   administration  or  similar
proceedings by or against LESSOR, LESSEE, Manufacturer,  the Engine manufacturer
or any other Person;

     (d) invalidity or unenforceability or lack of due authorization of or other
defect in this Lease;

     (e)  failure or delay on the part of any party to perform  its  obligations
under this Lease; or

     (f) any other circumstance which but for this provision would or might have
the effect of terminating or in any other way affecting any obligation of LESSEE
hereunder.

     5.8.2 Nothing in Article 5.8 will be construed to limit LESSEE's rights and
remedies in the event of LESSOR's  breach of its warranty of quiet enjoyment set
forth in Article  21.2 or to limit  LESSEE's  rights and remedies to pursue in a
court of law any claim it may have against LESSOR or any other Person.

     5.9 LESSOR  PERFORMANCE OF LESSEE  OBLIGATION.  If LESSEE fails to make any
payment  under this Lease to a third party in  connection  with the  Aircraft or
fails to perform any other obligation required under this Lease, LESSOR may (but
is not required to) at its  election  and without  waiver of its rights  perform
such  obligation  and/or pay such amount.  Within five (5)  Business  Days after
written  notice  to  LESSEE of the  amount  paid by LESSOR on behalf of  LESSEE,
LESSEE will repay such amount to LESSOR  together  with Default  Interest.  Such
payment to LESSOR will  constitute  additional  Rent payable by LESSEE to LESSOR
hereunder.  Any  payment,  performance  or  compliance  by  LESSOR  of a  LESSEE
obligation  hereunder will not affect the occurrence or continuance of a Default
or Event of Default, as the case may be.

DESCRIPTION  AND ANY AND ALL  RIGHTS  IT MAY HAVE TO THE  REMEDIES  SET FORTH IN
SECTIONS 10508 THROUGH 10522 OF THE CALIFORNIA  COMMERCIAL  CODE. EVEN IF AT ANY

AIRCRAFT BASED ON A REASONABLE  ASSUMPTION THAT THE NONCONFORMITY WOULD BE CURED
AND IT WAS NOT  SEASONABLY  CURED OR (ii) LESSEE  ACCEPTED THE AIRCRAFT  WITHOUT
DISCOVERING  THE  NONCONFORMITY  BUT  LESSEE'S  ACCEPTANCE  OF THE  AIRCRAFT WAS
REASONABLY  INDUCED  EITHER  BY  LESSOR'S  ASSURANCES  OR BY THE  DIFFICULTY  OF

FOR DAMAGES OR RELIEF  ARISING OUT OF THE FAILURE OF THE  AIRCRAFT TO CONFORM TO
SUCH DESCRIPTION.

not to seek to establish or enforce any rights and remedies,  express or implied
(whether  statutory or otherwise) against LESSOR or the Aircraft relating to any
of the matters mentioned in Articles 8.1 or 8.2.

8.4  CONCLUSIVE  PROOF.  DELIVERY  BY  LESSEE  TO  LESSOR  OF THE  ESTOPPEL  AND
ACCEPTANCE  CERTIFICATE  WILL BE CONCLUSIVE  PROOF AS BETWEEN  LESSOR AND LESSEE
THAT LESSEE'S  TECHNICAL EXPERTS HAVE EXAMINED AND INVESTIGATED THE AIRCRAFT AND
ENGINES AND (a) EACH IS AIRWORTHY  AND IN GOOD WORKING  ORDER AND REPAIR AND (b)
THE  AIRCRAFT  AND ENGINES AND THE  AIRCRAFT  DOCUMENTATION  ARE WITHOUT  DEFECT
(WHETHER OR NOT  DISCOVERABLE  AT  DELIVERY)  AND IN EVERY WAY  SATISFACTORY  TO
LESSEE.

8.5 NO LESSOR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES. LESSEE agrees that LESSOR will not be liable
to LESSEE, any sublessee or any Person,  whether in contract or tort and however
arising,  for any cost, loss or damage  (consequential or otherwise) arising out

         ARTICLE 10           OPERATION OF AIRCRAFT



     10.1 COSTS OF OPERATION.  As between LESSEE and LESSOR, LESSEE will pay all
costs  incurred in the  operation  of the  Aircraft  during the Lease Term,  for
profit or otherwise, including the costs of flight crews, cabin personnel, fuel,
oil, lubricants,  maintenance,  insurance, storage, landing and navigation fees,
airport charges, passenger service and any and all other expenses of any kind or
nature,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  connection  with or  related to the use,
movement  and  operation  of  the  Aircraft.  The  obligations,   covenants  and
liabilities  of  LESSEE  under  this  paragraph  arising  prior to return of the
Aircraft to LESSOR will continue in full force and effect,  notwithstanding  the
termination of this Lease or expiration of the Lease Term.

     10.2 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. LESSEE agrees throughout the Lease Term that all
use of the Aircraft will be in accordance  with  applicable Laws of the State of
Registration and of any country,  state,  territory or municipality into or over
which LESSEE may operate.  LESSEE will not employ,  suffer or cause the Aircraft
to be used in any business  which is forbidden by Law or in any manner which may
render it liable to condemnation,  destruction,  seizure, or confiscation by any
authority.  LESSEE will not permit the Aircraft to fly to any airport or country
if so doing would  cause  LESSEE to be in  violation  of any Law  applicable  to
LESSEE or the Aircraft.  The foregoing provisions in this Article 10.2 shall not
prohibit any  violation of Law (a) during a good-faith  contest of the validity,
application,  or alleged  violation  thereof in any reasonable manner so long as
there  is no  material  danger  of  sale,  forfeiture,  or loss of the  Aircraft
(however,  this good faith  exception shall not apply in the case of a mandatory
grounding  order,  the good faith  contest  of which  does not permit  LESSEE to
operate the Aircraft during such contest),  and which does not extend beyond the
end of the Lease Term if the pendency of such contest would adversely affect the
Aircraft or the remarketing  thereof in any material respect;  and (b) for minor
or non-recurring  violations (with the  understanding  that minor violations may
cease to be minor if  recurring)  that  LESSEE is  diligently  trying to rectify
which  do  not  render  the  Aircraft  liable  to  any  risk  of   condemnation,
destruction, seizure, or confiscation by any Government Entity.

     10.3 TRAINING. LESSEE will not use the Aircraft for testing or for training
of flight  crew  members  other than  LESSEE  crew  members and will not use the
Aircraft for training any more than it utilizes for training the other  aircraft
in its fleet.

     10.4 NO VIOLATION OF INSURANCE POLICIES.  LESSEE will not use or permit the
Aircraft to be used in any manner or for any purpose which is not covered by the
insurance policies LESSEE is required to carry and maintain as set forth in this
Lease.  LESSEE will not carry any goods of any description that would invalidate
or limit such policies or do any other act or permit to be done  anything  which
could reasonably be expected to invalidate or limit any such insurance policy.


<PAGE>


     10.5 FLIGHT CHARGES.

     10.5.1  LESSEE will pay promptly when due all enroute  navigation  charges,
navigation  service  charges and all other charges payable by LESSEE for the use
of or for services  provided at any airport,  whether in respect of the Aircraft
or any other aircraft of LESSEE,  and will indemnify and hold LESSOR harmless in
respect  of the same.  This  indemnity  will  continue  in full force and effect
notwithstanding  the  termination or expiration of the Lease Term for any reason
or the return of the Aircraft.

     10.5.2 If  requested by LESSOR,  LESSEE will provide  LESSOR with a list of
the  airports  to which  LESSEE  regularly  operates  the  Aircraft or its other
aircraft.  LESSEE hereby authorizes Eurocontrol or another aviation authority or
airport or  creditor  claiming  rights on the  Aircraft to confirm the status of
LESSEE's  payments to such creditor for the Aircraft and its other aircraft,  as
and when requested by LESSOR.


<PAGE>



         ARTICLE 11           SUBLEASES



     11.1 NO SUBLEASE  WITHOUT LESSOR CONSENT.  LESSEE WILL NOT SUBLEASE OR PART
WITH POSSESSION OF THE AIRCRAFT  (EXCEPT FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR) AT ANY TIME
WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN  CONSENT OF LESSOR (NOT TO BE  UNREASONABLY  WITHHELD)
AND IN ACCORDANCE  WITH SUCH  REQUIREMENTS AS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE AGREED IN
WRITING  BETWEEN LESSOR AND LESSEE.  The wet leasing of the Aircraft  during the
Lease Term (in which  LESSEE  and its crews  retain  operational  control of the
Aircraft) will not be considered a sublease of the Aircraft.

     11.2  LESSOR  COSTS.  LESSEE  will  indemnify  LESSOR  on  demand  for  all
out-of-pocket  expenses  (including  legal  fees)  incurred in  connection  with
LESSOR's  assessment of the subleasing proposal (whether or not LESSOR's consent
to such sublease is ultimately given) and implementation of the sublease.

     11.3 ANY APPROVED  SUBLEASE.  Any sublease approved by LESSOR will be for a
term no greater than the remaining Lease Term and contain provisions  consistent
with this Lease protecting LESSOR's title to the Aircraft, providing appropriate
LESSOR  indemnities,  regarding  the  maintenance  and repair  standards for the
Aircraft,  concerning the insurances  which will be carried by the sublessee and
the  circumstances  which  constitute  a Total  Loss of the  Aircraft.  Any such
sublease will be subject and subordinate to this Lease. In its sole  discretion,
LESSOR may  require an opinion  of  counsel in  connection  with such  sublease,
including  LESSOR's  right to repossess the Aircraft in the event of an Event of
Default hereunder or under the sublease.  LESSEE will not amend the terms of any
approved sublease without the prior written consent of LESSOR, which will not be
unreasonably withheld.

     11.4  ASSIGNMENT  OF SUBLEASE.  Any approved  sublease  will be assigned to
LESSOR as security. LESSEE will deliver the original counterpart of the sublease
to LESSOR and make any filings necessary to protect LESSOR's security interest.

     11.5  CONTINUED  RESPONSIBILITY  OF  LESSEE.  LESSEE  will  continue  to be
responsible  for  performance  of its  obligations  under this Lease  during any
period of sublease.

         ARTICLE 12           MAINTENANCE AND USE OF AIRCRAFT



12.1            GENERAL OBLIGATION.

     12.1.1  During the Lease Term and until the Aircraft is returned to LESSOR,

with any other  regulations  or  requirements  necessary  in order to maintain a
valid Certificate of Airworthiness for the Aircraft and meet the requirements at

aircraft issued by the Aviation  Authority (except during those periods when the
Aircraft is undergoing  maintenance  or repairs as required or permitted by this
Lease)  and (e) in the same  manner  and with the same care as used by LESSEE or
its sublessee with respect to similar aircraft and engines operated by LESSEE or
its sublessee and without in any way discriminating against the Aircraft.

     12.1.2  LESSEE will  maintain and repair the Engines in the same manner and
in  the  equivalent  time  frame  to its  other  engines  and  LESSEE  will  not
discriminate   against  any  of  the  Engines  in  respect  of  the  repair  and
maintenance.

     12.1.3  LESSEE will not enter into any Engine  maintenance  cost per flight
hour,  power-by-the-hour  or similar  agreement with Engine  manufacturer or any
other Engine maintenance facility or organization without LESSOR's prior written
consent.

     12.2 SPECIFIC  OBLIGATIONS.  Without limiting  Article 12.1,  LESSEE agrees
that such  maintenance  and repairs will include but will not be limited to each
of the following specific items:

     (a) performance in accordance  with the Maintenance  Program of all routine
and non-routine maintenance work;

<PAGE>


     (c) incorporation in the Aircraft of all service bulletins of Manufacturer,
the Engine manufacturer and other vendors which LESSEE schedules to adopt within

intent of the parties that the Aircraft will not be discriminated  from the rest
of  LESSEE's  fleet  in  service  bulletin   compliance   (including  method  of
compliance) or other maintenance  matters.  LESSEE will not discriminate against
the Engines with  respect to Overhaul  build  standards  and  life-limited  part
replacements;

     (d)  incorporation  in  the  Maintenance  Program  for  the  Aircraft  of a
corrosion prevention and control program;

     (e) maintaining in English and keeping in an up-to-date  status the records
and historical documents set forth in Attachment 1 of Exhibit I;

     (f)  maintaining   historical  records,  in  English,   for  on  condition,

manufacturer  of such Part or a repair facility which evidence that such Part is
new or  overhauled  and establish  authenticity,  total time in service and time
since  overhaul  for such Part),  the hours and cycles the  Aircraft and Engines
operate and all maintenance and repairs performed on the Aircraft; and

     (g) properly documenting all repairs, Modifications and alterations and the
addition,  removal  or  replacement  of  equipment,  systems  or  components  in
accordance  with  the  rules  and  regulations  of the  Aviation  Authority  and
reflecting such items in the Aircraft Documentation. In addition, all repairs to
the Aircraft will be accomplished in accordance with  Manufacturer's  Structural
Repair Manual (or FAA-approved data supported by FAA Form 8110-3 or equivalent).
All  Modifications  and alterations will also be accomplished in accordance with
FAA-approved data supported by FAA Form 8110-3 or equivalent.


12.3            REPLACEMENT OF PARTS.


<PAGE>


     12.3.1 LESSEE, at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts
which may from time to time become worn out, lost,  stolen,  destroyed,  seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered unfit or beyond economical repair
(BER) for any reason.  In the ordinary course of maintenance,  service,  repair,
overhaul or testing,  LESSEE may remove any Part provided  that LESSEE  replaces
such Part as promptly as practicable. All replacement Parts will (a) be free and
clear  of all  Security  Interests  (except  Permitted  Liens)  of any  kind  or
description,  (b) be in airworthy  condition and of at least  equivalent  model,
service bulletin and  modification  status and have a value and utility at least
equal to the Parts replaced,  assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition
and repair  required to be maintained by the terms hereof and (c) have a current
"serviceable  tag" of the  manufacturer or maintenance  facility  providing such
items to LESSEE,  indicating that such Parts are new, serviceable or Overhauled.
So long as a substitution meets the requirements of the Maintenance  Program and
Aviation Authority, LESSEE may substitute for any Part a part that does not meet
the  requirements  of the  foregoing  sentence  if a  complying  Part  cannot be
procured or installed  within the  available  groundtime  of the Aircraft and as
soon as practicable the noncomplying part is removed and replaced by a complying
Part.

     12.3.2 All Parts  removed  from the  Airframe or any Engine will remain the
property of LESSOR and subject to this Lease no matter where located, until such
time as such Parts have been replaced by Parts (which have been  incorporated or
installed  in or  attached  to the  Airframe  or such  Engine)  which  meet  the
requirements for replacement Parts specified above and title to such replacement
Parts has passed to LESSOR under the Laws of the State of  Registration  and LEX
SITUS.  To  the  extent  permitted  by  the  Laws  of the  State  of  ---  -----
Registration  and the LEX  SITUS it is the  intent  of LESSOR  and  LESSEE  that
without further --- ----- act and immediately upon any replacement Part becoming
incorporated,  installed  or  attached  to the  Airframe  or an  Engine as above
provided,  (a) title to the removed Part will thereupon vest in LESSEE, free and
clear of all rights of LESSOR,  (b) title to the replacement Part will thereupon
vest in LESSOR  free and clear of all rights of LESSEE and (c) such  replacement
Part will become  subject to this Lease and be deemed to be a Part  hereunder to
the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or such Engine.

12.4            REMOVAL OF ENGINES.


     12.4.1 If an Engine is removed for testing,  service, repair,  maintenance,
Overhaul work,  alterations or  modifications,  title to such Engine will remain
vested in LESSOR.

     12.4.2  LESSEE  will be  entitled  to remove  any of the  Engines  from the

LESSEE complies with each of the following obligations:

     (a) the insurance requirements set forth in Article 17 and Exhibit C are in
place;

     (b) LESSEE ensures that the identification plates referred to in Article 14

<PAGE>


     (c)  title to the  Engine  remains  with  LESSOR  free  from  all  Security
Interests  (except  Permitted Liens) regardless of the location of the Engine or
its attachment to or detachment from the Aircraft.

     12.5 POOLING OF ENGINES AND PARTS. With LESSOR's prior written consent, not
to be unreasonably withheld,  LESSEE may subject the Engines and Parts to normal
interchange  or pooling  agreements  with  responsible  commercial  air carriers
customary  in the airline  industry  and entered  into by LESSEE in the ordinary
course of its business with respect to its Boeing  737-800 fleet  generally,  so
long as (a) in the case of pooling  of an Engine,  such  Engine is  returned  to
LESSEE within two (2) months, (b) no transfer of title to the Engine occurs, (c)
all other  terms of this  Lease  continue  to be  observed  with  respect to the
Engines or Parts,  including  but not limited to Articles 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17 and 18 and (d) LESSEE continues to be fully responsible to LESSOR for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder.

     12.6 INSTALLATION OF ENGINES ON OTHER AIRCRAFT. Any Engine removed from the
Aircraft may be installed on another  airframe in LESSEE's  fleet which utilizes
engines of the same type as the Engine only if one of the  situations  described
in this Article 12.6 exists:

     12.6.1 LESSEE or LESSOR has title to such other  aircraft free and clear of
all Security Interests (except Permitted Liens).

     12.6.2  LESSEE,  LESSOR and all of the Creditors of LESSEE of such aircraft
enter into an engines cooperation  agreement in form and substance acceptable to
LESSOR in which each  party  agrees to  recognize  one  another's  rights in the
engines.  LESSEE will reimburse  LESSOR and LESSOR's Lender for their reasonable
attorneys'  fees and costs in  negotiating  and  finalizing  engine  cooperation
agreement arrangements with LESSEE and its Creditors.

     12.6.3 Such other aircraft is subject to a Creditor Agreement (but no other
Security  Interests  except  Permitted  Liens)  which by its terms  expressly or
effectively  states that such Creditor and its  successors  and assigns will not
acquire  any right,  title or  interest  in any Engine by reason of such  Engine
being installed on such aircraft. LESSEE hereby agrees that if LESSOR's title to
an Engine is in fact impaired under any such Creditor Agreement, such impairment
will be a Total Loss of such  Engine  and the  provisions  of Article  18.5 will
apply. To the extent another Creditor Agreement  contains such provisions,  then
LESSOR hereby agrees for the benefit of the Creditor of such Creditor  Agreement
that  neither  LESSOR nor its  successors  or assigns  will acquire or claim any
right,  title or interest in any engine in which LESSEE or another  Creditor has
an interest as a result of such engine being installed on the Airframe.

12.7            MODIFICATIONS.

     12.7.1 No  modification,  alteration,  addition or removal to the  Aircraft
("MODIFICATION")  expected  to cost  over Five  Hundred  Thousand  U.S.  Dollars
(US$500,000)   or  deviation  from  the  Aircraft's   original  type  design  or
configuration  will be made without the prior written  consent of LESSOR,  which
consent  will  not be  unreasonably  withheld.  "Modifications"  do not  include
Airworthiness  Directives or Manufacturer's  recommended service bulletins,  for
which LESSOR's consent is not required.

     12.7.2 LESSOR may review  LESSEE's  proposed  designs,  plans,  engineering
drawings and  diagrams,  and flight and  maintenance  manual  revisions  for any
proposed  Modification.  If requested by LESSOR,  LESSEE will furnish LESSOR (at
LESSEE's  expense)  with such  documents  in final form and any other  documents
required  by  Law,  as  a  result  of  such   Modification.   All  Modifications
incorporated  on the  Aircraft  will  be  properly  documented  in the  Aircraft

and is continuing hereunder.

     12.7.5 Unless otherwise agreed by LESSOR in writing,  all  non-severable or
structural Modifications will forthwith become a part of the Aircraft and LESSEE
relinquishes  to LESSOR all rights and title  thereto.  However,  all  severable
Modifications  will remain the property of LESSEE or the third-party  owner and,
at LESSOR's  request and LESSEE's cost,  will be removed from the Aircraft prior
to return of the Aircraft,  with LESSEE  restoring the Aircraft to the condition
it was in prior to the  Modification.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no such
removal will be permitted without LESSOR's permission after the occurrence of an
Event of Default  hereunder and  immediately  upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default  hereunder,  without the  requirement of any further act or notice,  all
right, title and interest in such Modifications will immediately vest in LESSOR.

     12.7.6 LESSOR will bear no liability for the cost of  Modifications  of the
Aircraft whether in the event of grounding or suspensions of  certification,  or
for any other cause.

and/or its authorized agents or  representatives  will have the right to inspect
the Aircraft and Aircraft  Documentation.  LESSOR agrees that such requests will
be coordinated with LESSEE so as to cause the minimum  practical  disturbance to
LESSEE's  operation or its personnel.  LESSEE agrees to cooperate with LESSOR in
making the  Aircraft  and Aircraft  Documentation  available to such  authorized
technical teams. No such inspection  shall include opening panels,  bays, or the
like (although  LESSOR may observe those that are then open),  or  disassembling
any  item.  LESSOR  will have no duty to make any such  inspection  and will not
incur  any  liability  or  obligation  by  reason  of  (and  LESSEE's  indemnity

         ARTICLE 15           TAXES


<PAGE>




     15.1 GENERAL  OBLIGATION  OF LESSEE.  Except as set forth in Article  15.2,
LESSEE  agrees to pay  promptly  when due, and to  indemnify  and hold  harmless
LESSOR on a full indemnity basis from, all license and registration fees and all
taxes,  fees,  levies,  imposts,  duties,  charges or withholdings of any nature
whatsoever (including without limitation any value added,  franchise,  transfer,
sales, gross receipts,  use, business,  occupation,  excise,  personal property,
real  property,  stamp or other tax) together with any  assessments,  penalties,
fines,  additions  to tax or  interest  thereon,  however  or  wherever  imposed
(whether  imposed  upon  LESSEE,  LESSOR,  on all or part of the  Aircraft,  the
Engines or otherwise), by any Government Entity or taxing authority in the U.S.,
any  State  thereof,  or any  foreign  country  or by any  international  taxing
authority,  upon or with  respect  to,  based  upon  or  measured  by any of the
following (collectively, "TAXES"):

     (a) the Aircraft, the Engines or any Parts.

     (b) the use,  operation  or  maintenance  of the  Aircraft  or  carriage of
passengers or freight during the Lease Term.

     (c) this Lease,  the payments due  hereunder  and the terms and  conditions
hereof.

     (d) the return of the Aircraft to LESSOR or other use or disposition of the
Aircraft by LESSEE.

     15.2 EXCEPTIONS TO INDEMNITY.  The indemnity  provided in Article 15.1 does
not extend to any of the following Taxes:

     (a) Imposed by the U.S.  (including  without limitation any taxes collected
by withholding) or any state or local government or governmental  subdivision or
state  or local  taxing  authority  in the U.S.  (including  any  possession  or
territory  of the  U.S.)  or by any  foreign  government,  taxing  authority  or
governmental  subdivision  of a foreign  country which are based on, or measured
by, the receipts,  gross or net income, capital, net worth,  franchises,  excess
profits, or conduct of business (including minimum taxes,  withholding taxes and
taxes on or measured by any items of tax  preference)  of LESSOR,  except to the
extent that such Tax would not have been imposed on or payable by LESSOR but for
the  location,  use,  registration  or  operation  of the  Aircraft  or any part
thereof,  or any place of business or any activity of LESSEE in the jurisdiction
imposing such Tax.



<PAGE>


     (b) Imposed as a result of LESSOR's transfer,  mortgage,  pledge, financing
or other  disposition  by  LESSOR  of all or a portion  of its  interest  in the
Aircraft or this Lease except a transfer or sale  resulting  from an exercise of
remedies  pursuant to Article 25.3 hereunder or in connection with a termination
of the Lease pursuant to Article 18 hereof.

     (c)  Attributable  to the period prior to the Delivery Date or after return
of the Aircraft to LESSOR in accordance with this Lease.

     (d) Attributable to LESSOR's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach
of this Lease.

     15.3  AFTER-TAX  BASIS.  The amount  which  LESSEE is  required to pay with
respect  to any  Taxes  indemnified  against  under  Article  15.1 is an  amount
sufficient to restore LESSOR on an after-tax  basis to the same position  LESSOR
would have been in had such Taxes not been incurred.



<PAGE>


     15.4  CLAIMS AND  CONTESTS.  If a written  claim is  received by LESSOR for
Taxes,  which claim, if sustained,  would require the payment of an indemnity by
LESSEE  pursuant to this Article 15,  LESSOR  shall notify  LESSEE of such claim
within thirty (30) days after its receipt, provided that failure to provide such
notice  within thirty (30) days will not relieve  LESSEE of any  indemnification
obligation  pursuant to this Article 15 if such failure does not preclude LESSEE
from exercising its contest rights hereunder. Payments due from LESSEE to LESSOR
pursuant to this Article 15 shall be made  directly to LESSOR within thirty (30)
days of written  demand by LESSOR to LESSEE.  If requested by LESSEE in writing,
LESSOR shall upon receipt of indemnity reasonably  satisfactory to it and at the
expense  of  LESSEE  (including,   without  limitation,  all  reasonable  costs,
expenses,  legal and accountants' fees, and disbursements,  penalties,  interest
incurred in contesting  such claim,  and additions to tax) in good faith, in the
name of LESSOR  or, if  requested  by  LESSEE,  in the name of LESSEE (or permit
LESSEE,  if desired by LESSEE,  to contest in the name of LESSEE) if permissible
under  applicable  laws, the validity,  applicability or amount of such Taxes by
(i) resisting payment thereof if practicable only if adequate reserves have been
made for such Taxes or, if  required,  an adequate  bond has been  posted,  (ii)
paying the same under protest,  if protest shall be necessary and proper,  (iii)
if payment shall be made, using reasonable efforts to obtain a refund thereof in
appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings,  and (iv) taking such other
action as is  reasonably  requested  by LESSEE from time to time  including  not
paying such Taxes only if adequate reserves have been made for such Taxes or, if
required, an adequate bond has been posted. LESSOR shall determine the method of
any contest and (in good faith  consultation  with  LESSEE)  control the conduct
thereof.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained in this Article 15.4, LESSOR will
not  be  required  to  contest,  or  to  continue  to  contest,   the  validity,
applicability  or amount of any Tax (or  portion  thereof)  (x) if such  contest
would result in any material risk of criminal  penalties or any material risk of
sale,  forfeiture  or loss of the  Aircraft,  (y) if an  Event  of  Default  has
occurred and is  continuing,  or (z) in the case of a contest of a Tax reflected
on a return of LESSOR with other taxes of LESSOR that are not indemnified by the
LESSEE  hereunder,  if LESSEE shall not have furnished an opinion of independent
tax counsel selected by the LESSEE, and reasonably  satisfactory to LESSOR, that
a reasonable  basis exists for such contest.  If LESSOR shall obtain a refund of
all or any part of such Taxes for which an indemnity was paid by LESSEE,  LESSOR
shall pay LESSEE the amount of such refund; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that such amount
shall not be payable  before such time as LESSEE shall have made all payments or
indemnities  to LESSOR  then due under  this  Article  15 and under the Lease or
while an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  If in addition
to such  refund  LESSOR  shall  receive an amount  representing  interest on the
amount of such refund,  LESSEE shall be paid that  proportion  of such  interest
which is fairly  attributable to Taxes paid with an indemnity  payment by LESSEE
prior to the receipt of such refund or interest and increased by any taxes saved
by reason of the  deductibility  of such payment by LESSOR.  LESSEE shall not be
deemed to be in default under any of the  indemnification  provisions under this
Article 15 so long as it or LESSOR shall  diligently  prosecute such contest and
LESSEE has indemnified LESSOR to LESSOR's reasonable  satisfaction.  In case any
report or return is required to be made with respect to any obligation of LESSEE
under this Article 15.4 or arising out of this Article 15.4,  LESSEE will either
timely make such report or return in such manner as will show the  ownership  of
the Aircraft in LESSOR,  and will as soon as possible send a copy of such report
or return to LESSOR,  or will notify LESSOR of such  requirement and prepare and
deliver such report or return to LESSOR in such manner as shall be  satisfactory
to LESSOR.

     15.5 REFUNDS.  Upon receipt by LESSOR of a refund of all or any part of any
Taxes  (including  any deductions or  withholdings  referred to in Article 15.1)
which  LESSEE has paid,  LESSOR  will pay to LESSEE the net amount of such Taxes
refunded.

     15.6  COOPERATION  IN FILING TAX RETURNS.  LESSEE and LESSOR will cooperate
with one another in providing  information  which may be reasonably  required to
fulfill each party's tax filing  requirements and any audit information  request
arising from such filing.

         ARTICLE 16           INDEMNITIES

     16.1 GENERAL INDEMNITY.  Except as set forth in Article 16.2, LESSEE agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless  LESSOR and its officers,  directors,  employees,
agents  and   shareholders   (individually   an  "INDEMNITEE"  and  collectively
"INDEMNITEES")  from  any and all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties,  claims, actions, suits, costs, disbursements and expenses (including
legal fees, costs and related expenses) of every kind and nature, whether or not
any of the transactions contemplated by this Lease are consummated (collectively
"EXPENSES"),  which  are  imposed  on,  incurred  by  or  asserted  against  any
Indemnitee  and which are in any way relating to, based on or arising out of any
of the following:

     (a) this Lease or any transactions contemplated hereby;

     (b) the operation,  possession, use, non-use, control, leasing, subleasing,
maintenance,  storage, overhaul,  testing,  inspections or acceptance flights at
return of the Aircraft,  any Engine or any Part during the Lease Term by LESSEE,
any sublessee or any other Person, whether or not the same is in compliance with
the terms of this Lease, including without limitation claims for death, personal
injury, property damage, other loss or harm to any Person and claims relating to
any  Laws,  including  without  limitation   environmental  control,  noise  and
pollution laws, rules or regulations;

     (c) the manufacture, design, acceptance,  rejection, delivery, return, sale
in  connection  with an Event of Default,  import,  export,  condition,  repair,
modification,  servicing,  rebuilding,  enforcement  of  warranties  whether  in
LESSOR's or LESSEE's name, customer and product support provided by Manufacturer
and other vendors,  airworthiness,  registration,  reregistration,  performance,
sublease,  merchantability,  fitness for use, substitution or replacement of the
Aircraft,  Engine  or any Part  under  this  Lease or other  transfer  of use or
possession of the  Aircraft,  Engine or any Part,  including  under a pooling or
interchange arrangement,  including without limitation latent and other defects,
whether or not discoverable and patent, trademark or copyright infringement;

     (d) any non-compliance by LESSEE with any term of this Lease or the falsity
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of LESSEE set forth herein;

     (e) the prevention or attempt to prevent the arrest, confiscation, seizure,
taking in execution, impounding,  forfeiture or detention of the Aircraft, or in
securing the release of the Aircraft; or


<PAGE>


     (f) as a  consequence  of any Default in payment by LESSEE of any sum to be
paid by LESSEE  when due under this Lease or any other  Default by LESSEE in the
due and punctual performance of its obligations under this Lease.

     The  foregoing  indemnity  by LESSEE is  intended  to include and cover any
Expense  to which an  Indemnitee  may be  subject  (in  contract,  tort,  strict
liability or under any other  theory)  regardless of the  negligence,  active or
passive or any other type, of such Indemnitee,  so long as such Expense does not
fall within any of the exceptions listed in Article 16.2.

     16.2  EXCEPTIONS  TO GENERAL  INDEMNITIES.  The  indemnity  provided for in
Article  16.1 will not  extend  to  Expenses  of any  Indemnitee  to the  extent
resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

     (a)  Expenses  which have  resulted  from the  willful  misconduct  of such
Indemnitee;

     (b)  Expenses  which LESSEE and LESSOR  mutually  agree or,  absent  mutual
agreement,  are judicially determined to be attributable to acts or events which
occur  after the  Termination  Date and return of the  Aircraft to LESSOR in the
condition  required  hereunder,  but in any such  case  only to the  extent  not
attributable to acts or omissions of LESSEE;

     (c) Expenses  representing  Taxes, it being  acknowledged that the terms of
Article 15 apply exclusively to LESSEE's  indemnity  obligations with respect to
Taxes;

     (d) Expenses due to the breach by LESSOR of its covenant of quiet enjoyment
pursuant to Article 21.2 (except to the extent covered by LESSEE's insurances);

     (e) Expenses  which arise in connection  with the transfer by LESSOR of any
interest in the Aircraft or this Lease,  except for any  transfer in  connection
with any Event of Default or a Total Loss of the Aircraft or an Engine.

     (f)  Expenses  which  are  solely  attributable  to the  representation  or
warranty of LESSOR contained in or made pursuant to any Operative Document being
untrue;

     (g) Expenses which are solely related to the failure of such Indemnitees to
perform or observe  any  agreement,  covenant,  or  condition  on its part to be
performed or observed in any Operative Document;



<PAGE>


     (h)  Expenses  which are solely an ordinary  and usual  internal  customary
operating expense; or

     (i) Expenses which are solely related to a breach of Article 21.1.6, or

     (j) Expenses which are solely related to a LESSOR's Lien.

     16.3 AFTER-TAX  BASIS. The amount which LESSEE will be required to pay with
respect to any Expense  indemnified against under Article 16.1 will be an amount
sufficient  to  restore  the  Indemnitee,  on an  after-tax  basis,  to the same
position such Indemnitee would have been in had such Expense not been incurred.

     16.4  TIMING  OF  PAYMENT.  It is the  intent  of  the  parties  that  each
Indemnitee will have the right to indemnification for Expenses hereunder as soon
as a claim is made and as soon as an  Expense is  incurred,  whether or not such
claim is meritorious and whether or not liability is established (but subject to
Articles 16.2 and 16.8).  LESSEE will pay an Indemnitee for Expenses pursuant to
this Article 16 within ten (10) days after receipt of a written demand  therefor
from such Indemnitee accompanied by a written statement describing in reasonable
detail the basis for such  indemnity  (but not  before  payment is due from such
Indemnitee).

     16.5  SUBROGATION.  Upon the payment in full of any  indemnity  pursuant to
this  Article  16 by  LESSEE,  LESSEE  will be  subrogated  to any  right of the
Indemnitee in respect of the matter against which such indemnity has been made.

     16.6 NOTICE. Each Indemnitee and LESSEE will give prompt written notice one
to the other of any liability of which such party has knowledge for which LESSEE
is, or may be,  liable under Article 16.1;  provided,  however,  that failure to
give such notice will not terminate any of the rights of Indemnitees  under this
Article 16 except to the extent that LESSEE has been  materially  prejudiced  by
the failure to provide such notice.

     16.7 REFUNDS.  If any  Indemnitee  obtains a recovery of all or any part of
any amount which LESSEE has paid to such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee will pay to
LESSEE the net amount recovered by such Indemnitee.

     16.8 DEFENSE OF CLAIMS.

<PAGE>


     (a)  LESSEE  and its  insurers  will  have the  right (in each such case at
LESSEE's sole expense) to investigate  or,  provided that LESSEE or its insurers
have not reserved the right to dispute  liability  with respect to any insurance
policies  pursuant to which  coverage is sought,  defend or compromise any claim
covered by insurance  for which  indemnification  is sought  pursuant to Article
16.1 and each Indemnitee will cooperate with LESSEE or its insurers with respect
thereto. If LESSEE or its insurers are retaining attorneys to handle such claim,
such counsel must be reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Indemnitees.  If not, the
Indemnitees  will have the right to retain  counsel of their  choice at LESSEE's
expense.

     (b) Unless LESSOR agrees in writing  otherwise,  no settlement of any claim
hereunder  may require  LESSOR to agree to any remedy  apart from the payment of
money damages (for which such payment of money damages  LESSEE will in any event
indemnify the Indemnitees).

     (c) In no event  shall any  Indemnitee  enter  into a  settlement  or other
compromise  with respect to any Expense  without  LESSEE's prior written consent
(which shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  unless such Indemnitee
waives  its right to be  indemnified  with  respect to such  Expense  under this
Article 16.

     (d) To the extent that any Expense  indemnified by LESSEE  hereunder may be
covered by insurance maintained by LESSEE, at LESSEE's expense,  each Indemnitee
agrees  to  cooperate  with the  insurers  in the  exercise  of their  rights to
investigate, defend, or compromise that Expense as may be required to retain the
benefits of the insurance for that Expense.

     (e) If an Indemnitee is not a party to this Lease,  LESSEE may require that
Indemnitee to agree in writing to the terms of this Article 16 before making any
payment to such Indemnitee under this Article 16.

     16.9 SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATION.  Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the
contrary,  the provisions of this Article 16 will survive the  Termination  Date
and  continue in full force and effect  notwithstanding  any breach by LESSOR or
LESSEE of the terms of this Lease,  the termination of the lease of the Aircraft
to LESSEE under this Lease or the repudiation by LESSOR or LESSEE of this Lease.

         ARTICLE 17           INSURANCE



     17.1  CATEGORIES  OF  INSURANCE.  Throughout  the Lease  Term and until the
Termination  Date LESSEE will,  at its own expense,  effect and maintain in full
force and effect the types of  insurance  and  amounts of  insurance  (including
deductibles)  described in Exhibit C through such brokers and with such insurers
favorably regarded in the airline industry.

     17.2 INSURANCE FOR INDEMNITIES.  The insurance  referred to in Article 17.1
will in each case include and insure (to the extent of the risks  covered by the
policies) the  indemnity  provisions of Article 16 and LESSEE will maintain such
insurance  of the  indemnities  for a  minimum  of two (2) years  following  the
Termination Date.

     17.3 INSURANCE REQUIRED BY MANUFACTURER. During the Lease Term, LESSEE will
carry the  insurance  required  by  Manufacturer  in  connection  with  LESSOR's
assignment of Manufacturer's warranties and product support to LESSEE.

     17.4 RENEWAL.  Not less than two (2) Business Days before the expiration or
termination date of any insurance required hereunder, LESSEE will provide LESSOR
with fax confirmation from LESSEE's insurance brokers that renewed  certificates
of  insurance  evidencing  the  renewal or  replacement  of such  insurance  and
complying  with  Exhibit C will be issued on the  termination  date of the prior
certificate.  Within seven (7) days after such renewal,  LESSEE will furnish its
brokers' certificates of insurance to LESSOR.

     17.5  ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS BY LESSOR.  If LESSOR  assigns all or any of its
rights under this Lease as permitted by this Lease or otherwise  disposes of any
interest in the Aircraft to any other Person, LESSEE will, upon request, procure
that (to the extent of the assignment or disposition)  such Person  hereunder be
added as loss payee and/or additional assured in the policies effected hereunder
and enjoy the same rights and insurance  enjoyed by LESSOR under such  policies.
To the extent of its retained interest or as provided in Article 24.2.1,  LESSOR
will nevertheless continue to be covered by such policies.

     17.6  DEDUCTIBLES.  If there is a material  adverse change in the financial
condition of LESSEE which LESSOR  reasonably  believes will not enable LESSEE to
pay the  deductible  upon the occurrence of a partial loss of the Aircraft or an
Engine,  then  LESSOR  may  require  LESSEE  at  LESSEE's  expense  to lower its
deductibles on the insurance  maintained hereunder to a level which is available
on commercially reasonable terms in the insurance market.



<PAGE>


     17.7  OTHER  INSURANCE.  LESSOR  may from  time to time by notice to LESSEE
require  LESSEE at  LESSEE's  expense  to effect  such other  insurance  or such
variations  to the terms of the  existing  insurance as may then be customary in
the airline  industry  for  aircraft of the same type as the Aircraft and at the
time commonly available in the insurance market.

     17.8   INFORMATION.   LESSEE  will  provide  LESSOR  with  any  information
reasonably  requested  by LESSOR  from  time to time  concerning  the  insurance
maintained  with respect to the Aircraft or in  connection  with any claim being
made or proposed to be made thereunder.

     17.9  CURRENCY.  All proceeds of  insurance  pursuant to this Lease will be
payable in Dollars except as may be otherwise agreed by LESSOR.

     17.10 GROUNDING OF AIRCRAFT.  If at any time any of the insurance  required
pursuant  to this Lease will cease to be in full force and  effect,  LESSEE will
forthwith ground the Aircraft and keep the Aircraft  grounded until such time as
such insurance is in full force and effect again.

     17.11 FAILURE TO INSURE. If at any time LESSEE fails to maintain  insurance
in compliance  with this Article 17, LESSOR will be entitled but not bound to do
any of the  following  (without  prejudice to any other rights which it may have
under this Lease by reason of such failure):

     (a) to pay any premiums due or to effect or maintain  substitute  insurance
or otherwise remedy such failure in any reasonable  manner (and LESSEE will upon
demand reimburse LESSOR in full for any amount so expended in that  connection);
or

     (b) at any time while such failure is  continuing,  to require the Aircraft
to remain at any  airport or (as the case may be),  proceed to and remain at any
airport designated by LESSOR.

     17.12 LIMIT ON HULL IN FAVOR OF LESSEE.  LESSEE may carry hull all risks or
hull war and allied  perils on the Aircraft in excess of the Agreed Value (which
Agreed  Value is payable to LESSOR)  only to the extent  such  excess  insurance
which  would be  payable  to LESSEE in the event of a Total Loss does not exceed
fifteen  percent  (15%) of the  Agreed  Value and only to the  extent  that such
additional  insurance will not prejudice the insurances  required  herein or the
recovery by LESSOR  thereunder.  LESSEE agrees that it will not create or permit
to exist any liens or encumbrances over the insurances, or its interest therein,
except as constituted by this Lease.

     17.13 MARKETPLACE LIMITATIONS.  The insurance required by this Lease may be
subject  to  any  limitations  generally  prevailing  in the  airline  insurance
marketplace at the time (e.g., AVN67B).

         ARTICLE 18           LOSS, DAMAGE AND REQUISITION



     Throughout the Lease Term and until the Termination  Date, LESSEE will bear
all risk of loss, theft, damage and destruction to the Aircraft.

     18.1 DEFINITIONS. In this Article 18:

     "AGREED  VALUE"  (CONFIDENTIAL  MATERIAL  OMITTED)  The Agreed Value is set
forth in March  2001 U.S.  Dollars  and will be  increased  in  accordance  with
Manufacturer's  announced  escalation  rate from  March 1, 2001 to the  Delivery
Date. On each annual renewal date of LESSEE's insurance policy commencing on the
renewal date following the first anniversary of the Lease Term, the Agreed Value
will decrease by two percent (2.0%) of the then-existing Agreed Value.

     "NET TOTAL LOSS PROCEEDS" means the Total Loss Proceeds  actually  received
by LESSOR  following  a Total  Loss,  less any  legal  and  other  out-of-pocket
expenses or duties  incurred by LESSOR in connection with the collection of such
proceeds.

     "TOTAL  LOSS"  means any of the  following  in  relation  to the  Aircraft,
Airframe  or any  Engine  and  "TOTAL  LOSS  DATE"  means  the date set forth in
parenthesis after each Total Loss:

     (a) destruction,  damage beyond repair or being rendered  permanently unfit
for normal use for any reason (the date such event occurs or, if not known,  the
date on which the Aircraft, Airframe or Engine was last heard of);

     (b) actual, constructive,  compromised,  arranged or agreed total loss (the
earlier of the date on which the loss is agreed or  compromised  by the insurers
or thirty  (30) days after the date of notice to  LESSEE's  brokers or  insurers
claiming such total loss);

     (c)  requisition  of  title,  confiscation,  forfeiture  or any  compulsory
acquisition  of title or other  similar  event (the date on which the same takes
effect);

     (d)  sequestration,  detention,  seizure or any similar event for more than
one hundred  eighty  (180)  consecutive  days (the  earlier of the date on which
insurers  make payment on the basis of a total loss or the date of expiration of
such period);

     (e) requisition for use for more than one hundred eighty (180)  consecutive
days,  except as set forth in Article 18.8 (the earlier of the date on which the
insurers  make payment on the basis of a total loss or the date of expiration of
such period);


<PAGE>


     (f) in the case of an Engine,  the event  described in Article  12.6.3 (the
date on which the same takes effect);

     "TOTAL  LOSS  PROCEEDS"   means  the  proceeds  of  any  insurance  or  any
compensation or similar payment arising in respect of a Total Loss.

     18.2 NOTICE OF TOTAL LOSS.  LESSEE will notify LESSOR in writing within two
(2)  Business  Days after a Total  Loss Date of the  Aircraft,  Airframe  or any
Engine.

     18.3 TOTAL LOSS OF AIRCRAFT OR AIRFRAME.  If the Total Loss of the Aircraft
or Airframe occurs during the Lease Term, the following will occur:

     18.3.1 After the Total Loss Date and until  receipt by LESSOR of the Agreed
Value and all other  amounts then due under this Lease,  LESSEE will continue to
pay Rent and the parties will perform all of their other  obligations under this
Lease.

     18.3.2 On the date which is the earlier of the following dates:

     (a) the date on which  the  Total  Loss  Proceeds  of the  Aircraft  or the
Airframe are paid by LESSEE's insurance underwriters or brokers and

     (b) the date which falls sixty (60) days after the Total Loss Date,

     LESSEE will pay to LESSOR an amount equal to the sum of:

     (a) the Agreed Value and

     (b) all other amounts then due and payable under this Lease,

     less an amount equal to the Net Total Loss  Proceeds  received by LESSOR by
such date.




     18.3.3  LESSOR  will  apply the Net Total  Loss  Proceeds  and any  amounts
received from LESSEE pursuant to Article 18.3.2 as follows:

     (a) first,  in discharge of any unpaid Rent and any other  amounts  accrued
and unpaid up to the date of LESSOR's receipt of the Agreed Value;


<PAGE>


     (b) second, in discharge of the Agreed Value; and

     (c) third, payment of the balance, if any, to LESSEE.

     18.3.4  Upon  receipt by LESSOR of all monies  payable by LESSEE in Article
18.3,  provided  no Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  this Lease will
terminate except for LESSEE's  obligations  under Articles 10.5, 15 and 16 which
survive the Termination Date and the Security Deposit will be returned to LESSEE
in accordance with Article 5.3.1.

     FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE AGREED VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT WILL BE PAYABLE TO
LESSOR PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE 18.3 IF A TOTAL LOSS OF THE AIRFRAME OCCURS EVEN
IF THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOTAL LOSS OF AN ENGINE OR ENGINES.

     18.4 SURVIVING ENGINE(S).  If a Total Loss of the Airframe occurs and there
has not been a Total Loss of an Engine or Engines,  then provided no Default has
occurred and is  continuing,  at the request of LESSEE  (subject to agreement of
relevant  insurers)  and on receipt of all  monies  due under  Article  18.3 and
payment by LESSEE of all airport,  navigation and other charges on the Aircraft,
LESSOR will  transfer  all of its right,  title and  interest  in the  surviving
Engine(s) to LESSEE,  but without any  responsibility,  condition or warranty on
the part of LESSOR other than as to freedom from any LESSOR's Lien.

     18.5 TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE AND NOT AIRFRAME.

     18.5.1 Upon a Total Loss of any Engine not  installed  on the Airframe or a
Total Loss of an Engine  installed on the Airframe not involving a Total Loss of
the Airframe,  LESSEE will replace such Engine as soon as reasonably possible by
duly  conveying  to LESSOR  title to  another  engine  (a) free and clear of all
Security  Interests (except Permitted Liens) of any kind or description,  (b) in
airworthy  condition  and of the same or improved  model,  service  bulletin and
modification  status and having a value and utility at least equal to the Engine
which sustained the Total Loss, and (c) not older (by reference to serial number
or  manufacture  date)  than  three (3) years  older  than the oldest of the two
Engines  delivered by LESSOR to LESSEE with the  Aircraft on the Delivery  Date.
Such replacement engine will be an Engine as defined herein and the Engine which
sustained such Total Loss will cease to be an Engine.



<PAGE>


     18.5.2  LESSEE  agrees at its own expense to take such action as LESSOR may
reasonably  request  in order  that  any such  replacement  Engine  becomes  the
property of LESSOR and is leased  hereunder  on the same terms as the  destroyed
Engine.  LESSEE's obligation to pay Rent will continue in full force and effect,
but an amount  equal to the Net Total  Loss  Proceeds  received  by LESSOR  with
respect to such  destroyed  Engine  will,  subject to  LESSOR's  right to deduct
therefrom  any amounts then due and payable by LESSEE under this Lease,  be paid
to LESSEE.

     18.6 OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE.

     18.6.1 If the  Aircraft  or any Part  thereof  suffers  loss or damage  not
constituting a Total Loss of the Aircraft or the Airframe or any Engine, all the
obligations of LESSEE under this Lease (including payment of Rent) will continue
in full force.

     18.6.2 In the event of any loss or damage to the Aircraft or Airframe which
does not constitute a Total Loss of the Aircraft or the Airframe, or any loss or
damage to an Engine  which  does not  constitute  a Total  Loss of such  Engine,
LESSEE will at its sole cost and expense  fully repair the Aircraft or Engine in
order  that the  Aircraft  or Engine is placed  in an  airworthy  condition  and
substantially  the same  condition  as it was prior to such loss or damage.  All
repairs will be performed in accordance  with sound airline  procedures.  LESSEE
will notify  LESSOR  forthwith of any loss,  theft or damage to the Aircraft for
which the cost of repairs is estimated to exceed Seven  Hundred  Fifty  Thousand
U.S. Dollars (US$750,000),  together with LESSEE's proposal for carrying out the
repair.  In the event that LESSOR  does not agree with  LESSEE's  proposals  for
repair,  LESSOR will so notify  LESSEE  within two (2)  Business  Days after its
receipt of such proposal.  LESSEE and LESSOR will then consult with Manufacturer
and  LESSEE  and  LESSOR  agree  to  accept  as  conclusive,  and be  bound  by,
Manufacturer's  directions or recommendations as to the manner in which to carry
out  such   repairs.   If   Manufacturer   declines   to  give   directions   or
recommendations,  LESSEE  will  carry out the  repairs  in  accordance  with the
directions of LESSOR.

     18.6.3 To the extent  that  LESSOR has  received  insurance  proceeds  from
LESSEE's  insurers  with respect to any loss or damage,  LESSOR will (subject to
LESSOR's  right to deduct  therefrom  any amounts then due and payable by LESSEE
under this Lease and submission by LESSEE of reasonable documentation confirming
the completion of the repairs in accordance with the requirements of this Lease)
pay to LESSEE insurance proceeds received by LESSOR as and when such repair work
is performed on the Aircraft.



<PAGE>


     18.7 COPY OF INSURANCE  POLICY.  Promptly after LESSOR's request  following
the  occurrence  of a partial  loss or Total Loss of the  Aircraft or an Engine,
LESSEE will provide LESSOR with a copy of LESSEE's insurance policy.

     18.8  GOVERNMENT  REQUISITION.  If the Aircraft,  Airframe or any Engine is
requisitioned  for use by any  Government  Entity,  LESSEE will promptly  notify
LESSOR of such requisition.  All of LESSEE's obligations hereunder will continue
as if such  requisition  had not  occurred.  Except if a Default  or an Event of
Default has  occurred  and is  continuing,  all  payments  received by LESSOR or
LESSEE from such Government Entity will be paid over to or retained by LESSEE.

     18.9  CONVEYANCE TO LESSEE.  Upon  compliance by LESSEE with the applicable
terms of Article  18.3 or 18.5,  LESSOR will  transfer to LESSEE the Airframe or
Engine(s), as applicable, with respect to which such Total Loss.

     19.1 DEDICATION TO CRAF. LESSEE may transfer  possession of the Airframe or
any Engine to the United  States of  America  or any  instrumentality  or agency
thereof  as part of the Civil  Reserve  Air Fleet  Program  authorized  under 10
U.S.C. ss. 9511 ET SEQ. (or any substantially  similar program) ("CRAF PROGRAM")
for a  period  which  includes  (collectively,  the  "CRAF  PROGRAM  REQUISITION
PERIOD") the entire period of  requisition  under the CRAF Program.  If the CRAF
Program  Requisition  Period extends beyond the Expiration Date provided by this
Lease,  then the Lease will be deemed to continue  for six (6) months  after the
end of the CRAF Program Requisition Period at a monthly rental rate equal to the
monthly rental rate during the Lease Term. If such extension  extends beyond the
Lease Term,  then LESSEE will provide LESSOR with written notice of the proposed
redelivery  by the earlier of six (6) months  prior to the  proposed  redelivery
date or five (5)  Business  Days after the date of receipt of the actual  notice
given to LESSEE by the government prior to the government's  redelivery date and
LESSEE will return the Aircraft to LESSOR in the  condition  required by Article
23 on LESSEE's proposed redelivery date set forth in such notice.

     19.2 NOTICE TO LESSOR. LESSEE will promptly notify LESSOR in writing in the
event of the  requisition  for use of the Aircraft under CRAF  activation by the
U.S.  Government.  All of LESSEE's obligations under this Lease will continue to
the same extent as if such requisition had not occurred.

     19.3 REQUISITION OF ENGINE. If there is a requisition for use of any Engine
(but  not the  Airframe)  by the U.S.  Government  in  connection  with the CRAF
Program,  LESSEE will replace such Engine by complying with the terms of Article
18.5 hereof.

     19.4  GOVERNMENT  INDEMNIFICATION.  Any  provisions  of this  Lease  to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  if there is a  requisition  for use of the  Aircraft
pursuant to the CRAF Program and/or CRAF activation, LESSOR agrees that LESSEE's
insurances  described in Exhibit C may be  supplemented  by insurances  provided
under Title XIII of the Act, and/or U.S. Government indemnification (which Title
XIII  insurances  and  indemnification  will be in  amounts  not less than those
established  in  Exhibit  C);  provided,   however,   that  LESSEE  will  remain
responsible for full compliance with all the provisions of this Lease, including
Articles  14 and 16,  to the  extent  Title  XIII  and/or  the  U.S.  Government
indemnification do not satisfy LESSEE's obligations under this Lease.



<PAGE>


19.5 NO GEOGRAPHIC  LIMITS.  If there is a  requisition  for use of the Aircraft
pursuant to the CRAF Program and/or CRAF activation, there will be no limitation
on the  geographic  area in which the Aircraft may be operated so long as, taken
as  a  whole,   LESSEE's   insurance,   the  Title  XIII  insurance  and/or  the
indemnification  provided  by the  U.S.  Government  fully  cover  (without  any
     geographic exclusions) LESSEE's Exhibit C insurance requirements.

     19.6 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.  If an Event of Default occurs under this Lease and
LESSOR  elects to pursue its remedies  under Article  25.3(e) to terminate  this
Lease and repossess the Aircraft,  LESSOR will so notify the U.S.  Government by
sending a written communication as follows:

         Headquarters Air Mobility Command
         AMC Contracting Office -- XOKA
         Scott Air Force Base, Illinois  62225-5007

     19.7 RECEIPT OF PAYMENTS.  Subject to the following sentence,  all payments
received by LESSOR or LESSEE from such Government  Entity in connection with the
requisition  of the  Aircraft  under  the CRAF  Program  will be paid over to or
retained by LESSEE.  If a Default has occurred and is  continuing,  all payments
received by LESSEE or LESSOR from such Government  Entity in connection with the
requisition  of the  Aircraft  under the CRAF  Program  may be used by LESSOR to
satisfy any obligations owing by LESSEE.

substance to LESSOR,  containing  an effective  assumption by such Person of the
due and punctual  performance  and  observance of each  covenant,  agreement and
condition in the Operative Documents to be performed or observed by LESSEE;

     (iii) such Person makes such filings and  recordings  with the FAA pursuant
to the Act as shall be necessary to evidence such consolidation or merger;

     (iv) LESSEE furnishes LESSOR an opinion of counsel reasonably  satisfactory
to LESSOR to the effect that such  consolidation  or merger has satisfied at the
closing of such consolidation or merger items (i), (ii) and (iii) above;

     (v) immediately  after giving effect to such  consolidation  or merger,  no
Default or Event of Default exists;

     (vi) unless LESSOR otherwise  consents,  immediately after giving effect to
such consolidation or merger,  such Person will have a tangible net worth of not
less  than  sixty-five   percent  (65%)  of  the  LESSEE's  tangible  net  worth
immediately prior to such merger; and

     (vii)  upon such  merger  becoming  effective,  LESSOR  will enjoy the same
degree of protection  under ss. 1110 of the Bankruptcy  Code with respect to the
Aircraft as LESSOR enjoyed prior to such merger.

     (b) Upon any such  consolidation  or merger of LESSEE with or into,  or the
conveyance,  transfer,  or lease by  LESSEE of all or  substantially  all of its
assets to, any Person in accordance with this Article  20.2.4,  such Person will
succeed to, and be  substituted  for, and may exercise every right and power of,
LESSEE under the Operative  Documents with the same effect as if such Person had
been named as  "LESSEE"  therein.  No such  consolidation,  merger,  conveyance,
transfer, or lease shall have the effect of releasing LESSEE or such Person from
any of LESSEE's obligations,  liabilities, covenants, or undertakings under this
Lease.

     20.2.5  RESTRICTION  ON  RELINQUISHMENT  OF  POSSESSION.  LESSEE  will not,
without the prior consent of LESSOR, deliver,  transfer or relinquish possession
of the Aircraft except in accordance with Articles 11 and 12.


<PAGE>


     20.2.6 NO SECURITY INTERESTS.  LESSEE will not create or agree to or permit
to arise any Security  Interest (other than Permitted  Liens) on or with respect
to the Aircraft,  title thereto or any interest therein.  LESSEE will forthwith,
at its own  expense,  take all action as may be necessary to discharge or remove
any such Security Interest if it exists at any time. LESSEE will within five (5)
Business  Days  after  becoming  aware of the  existence  of any  such  Security
Interest give written notice thereof to LESSOR.

     20.2.7 REPRESENTATIONS TO OTHER PARTIES.  LESSEE will not represent or hold
out LESSOR as carrying  goods or  passengers  on the Aircraft or as being in any
way connected or associated with any operation of the Aircraft.

<PAGE>



     ARTICLE 23 RETURN OF AIRCRAFT



     23.1 DATE OF RETURN.  LESSEE is obligated to return the  Aircraft,  Engines
Parts and Aircraft  Documentation  to LESSOR on the  Expiration  Date,  unless a
Total Loss of the Aircraft  occurred prior to the Expiration Date and this Lease
was  terminated  early in accordance  with Article 18.3. If LESSEE is in Default
hereunder  by failing to return the  Aircraft  on the  Expiration  Date or if an
Event of Default occurs prior to the Expiration Date and LESSOR  repossesses the
Aircraft,  the return requirements set forth in this Article 23 nonetheless must
be met on the date the Aircraft is actually returned to LESSOR or repossessed by
LESSOR.

     23.2 TECHNICAL REPORT.  Six (6) months prior to the Expiration Date (and in
an updated form at return of the  Aircraft),  LESSEE will provide  LESSOR with a
Technical  Evaluation Report in the form and substance of Exhibit L, as revised,
and, in addition  upon  LESSOR's  request,  will make  copies  available  of (a)
drawings of the  interior  configuration  of the  Aircraft  both as it presently
exists and as it will exist at return,  (b) an  Airworthiness  Directive  status
list, (c) a service bulletin incorporation list, (d) rotable tracked,  hard-time
and   life-limited   component   listings,   (e)  a  list  of   LESSEE-initiated
modifications and alterations, (f) interior material burn certificates,  (g) the
Aircraft  Maintenance  Program,  (h) the  complete  workscope  for  the  checks,
inspections  and other work to be performed  prior to return,  (i) a list of all
no-charge  service bulletin kits with respect to the Aircraft which were ordered
by LESSEE from  Manufacturer  or Engine  manufacturer,  (j) current  Engine disk
sheets  and a  description  of the last shop  visit for each  Engine and (k) any
other data which is reasonably requested by LESSOR.

     23.3  RETURN  LOCATION.  LESSEE at its expense  will  return the  Aircraft,
Engines,   Parts  and   Aircraft   Documentation   to  LESSOR  at   Indianapolis
International Airport, Indianapolis,  Indiana or to such other airport as may be
mutually agreed to by LESSEE and LESSOR.

     23.4 FULL AIRCRAFT DOCUMENTATION REVIEW. For the period commencing at least
ten (10)  Business  Days prior to the proposed  redelivery  date and  continuing
until the date on which the  Aircraft  is  returned  to LESSOR in the  condition
required by this Lease,  LESSEE will provide for the review of LESSOR and/or its
representative all of the Aircraft records and historical documents described in
Exhibit K in one central room at the Aircraft return location.

     23.5 AIRCRAFT INSPECTION.


<PAGE>


     23.5.1 During the maintenance  checks  performed  immediately  prior to the
proposed redelivery and at the actual return of the Aircraft,  LESSOR and/or its
representatives  will have an opportunity  to conduct a full systems  functional
and  operational  inspection  of the  Aircraft  (and other  types of  reasonable
inspections  based upon the Aircraft type, age, use and other known factors with
respect to the  Aircraft) and a full  inspection  of the Aircraft  Documentation
(including records and manuals),  all to LESSOR's  satisfaction.  The inspection
will occur  during the Return  Check when the panels,  bays or the like are open
and certain Parts are disassembled.  LESSOR may inspect such opened panels, bays
or the like and the  disassembled  Parts so long as LESSOR  does not disrupt the
Return  Check or cause such Return Check to be extended  beyond the  anticipated
completion date of such Return Check. Any deficiencies  from the Aircraft return
condition  requirements set forth in this Article 23 will be corrected by LESSEE
at its cost prior to the acceptance flight described in Article 23.5.2.

     23.5.2 Immediately prior to the proposed redelivery of the Aircraft, LESSEE
will carry out for LESSOR and/or LESSOR's representatives an Aircraft acceptance
flight in accordance with Manufacturer's  standard flight operation check flight
procedures or, if agreed to in writing by LESSOR,  in accordance with an airline
acceptance flight procedure,  either of which will be for the duration necessary
to perform such check flight  procedures  but in any event not less than two (2)
hours.  Flight costs and fuel will be furnished by and at the expense of LESSEE.
Any deficiencies  from the Aircraft return  condition  requirements set forth in
this  Article 23 will be  corrected by LESSEE at its cost prior to return of the
Aircraft.

     23.5.3 To the  extent  that the ground  inspection  and  acceptance  flight
extend beyond the  Expiration  Date,  the Lease Term will be deemed to have been
automatically  extended  and the  obligations  of  LESSEE  hereunder  (including
Article  23.11.3)  will  continue on a  day-to-day  basis until the  Aircraft is
accepted  by LESSOR  executing  the  Return  Acceptance  Receipt  in the form of
Exhibit I.

     23.6 CERTIFICATE OF AIRWORTHINESS MATTERS.

     23.6.1 The Aircraft  will possess a current  Certificate  of  Airworthiness
issued by the Aviation Authority (although this Certificate of Airworthiness may
later be substituted by the Export Certificate of Airworthiness or equivalent if
requested by LESSOR pursuant to Article  23.10).  The Aircraft at return must be
in the condition  required in order to meet the requirements of a U.S.  Standard
Certificate of Airworthiness  for transport  category aircraft issued by the FAA
in  accordance  with  FAR  Part 21 and,  in  addition,  to  meet  the  operating
requirements of FAR Part 121.



<PAGE>


     23.6.2  LESSEE at its cost will  demonstrate  that the  Aircraft  meets the
requirements for issuance of the U.S. Standard  Certificate of Airworthiness for
transport  category aircraft specified in Article 23.6.1 by delivering to LESSOR
an actual U.S. Standard  Certificate of Airworthiness.  If there is a dispute in
regards to the  condition of the Aircraft or the  Aircraft  Documentation,  then
LESSEE will provide  LESSOR with a letter  acceptable to LESSOR signed by an FAA
Designated  Airworthiness  Representative  (DAR) or another Person acceptable to
LESSOR  stating  that the DAR or such  Person has  inspected  the  Aircraft  and
Aircraft  Documentation  (including  records and manuals) and has found that the
Aircraft meets the requirements for issuance of a U.S.  Standard  Certificate of
Airworthiness  for transport  category  aircraft in accordance  with FAR Part 21
and, in addition, meets the operating requirements of FAR Part 121.

     23.6.3 If the Aircraft is to be  registered  in a country other than in the
U.S.  after  return from  LESSEE,  LESSOR may in its sole  discretion  waive the
requirements  of Article  23.6.2 and instead  require that LESSEE at its expense
(to the extent  such  expense is no greater  than that which  LESSEE  would have
incurred  pursuant to Articles 23.6.1 and 23.6.2,  with any additional  expenses
being  for  LESSOR's  account)  put the  Aircraft  in a  condition  to meet  the
requirements  for issuance of a  Certificate  of  Airworthiness  of the Aviation
Authority of the next country of register.

     23.7 GENERAL CONDITION OF AIRCRAFT AT RETURN.

     23.7.1  The  Aircraft,  Engines  and Parts  will have been  maintained  and
repaired in accordance with the Maintenance  Program,  the rules and regulations
of the Aviation Authority and this Lease.

     23.7.2  Aircraft  Documentation  (including  records and manuals) will have
been  maintained  in an  up-to-date  status,  in  accordance  with the rules and
regulations  of the Aviation  Authority and the FAA and this Lease and in a form
necessary in order to meet the  requirements of Article 23.6.2.  The records and
historical documents set forth in Attachment 1 of Exhibit I will be in English.

     23.7.3 The Aircraft  will be in the same working  order and condition as at
Delivery  (subject to the other  provisions of this Article 23,  reasonable wear
and tear from normal flight operations  excepted),  with all pilot discrepancies
and deferred maintenance items cleared on a terminating action basis.

     23.7.4 The Aircraft  will be airworthy  (conform to type design and be in a
condition  for safe  operation),  with all Aircraft  equipment,  components  and
systems  operating  in  accordance  with their  intended  use and within  limits
approved by the Manufacturer, Aviation Authority and FAA.


<PAGE>


     23.7.5 The  Aircraft  interior  (including  cabin and windows) and exterior
will be clean and all  compartments  will be reasonably free of foreign objects,
dirt, grease,  fluids, stains, grime, cracks, tears and rips (with the exception
of  normal  wear and tear) and  ready to be  placed  into  immediate  commercial
airline operations.

     23.7.6 No special or unique  Manufacturer,  Engine manufacturer or Aviation
Authority inspection or check requirements which are specific to the Aircraft or
Engines (as opposed to all  aircraft or engines of their  types) will exist with
respect to the Airframe, Engines and Aircraft equipment, components and systems.

     23.7.7 All repairs, modifications and alterations to the Aircraft will have
been accomplished in accordance with Manufacturer's Structural Repair Manual (or
FAA-approved data supported by FAA Form 8110-3) for the Aircraft.

     23.7.8 The Aircraft will be returned with  LESSOR's  Engines  installed and
with the same  equipment  as at Delivery,  subject  only to those  replacements,
additions  and  Modifications  permitted  under this  Lease.  LESSEE will inform
LESSOR of whether LESSEE will be able to redeliver the Engines with the Aircraft
and the proposed  replacement  engines  that LESSEE  wants to provide  LESSOR in
place of the Engines. LESSEE will provide LESSOR with whatever data, records and
information  that LESSOR  reasonably  requests in order to evaluate the proposed
replacement  engines. In the event that LESSEE is unable to return either of the
Engines in the conditions required by this Article 23, then LESSEE may provide a
replacement  engine (a  "REPLACEMENT  ENGINE") for such Engine to LESSOR by duly
conveying  to  LESSOR as owner  hereunder  title to  another  engine of the same
manufacturer  and of the same or an improved  model as the Engine being replaced
and suitable for  installation  and use on the  Aircraft,  which engine shall be
free and clear of all  Security  Interests,  and shall be no more than three (3)
years older by  reference to serial  number than the replaced  Engine and have a
modification  status,  value and utility at least equal to the Engine which such
Replacement  Engine is replacing on the Aircraft assuming that such Engine which
such Replacement Engine is replacing was then of the value, utility,  condition,
and  airworthiness  required to be maintained  by the terms of this Lease.  Such
Replacement Engine,  after approval and acceptance by LESSOR, shall be deemed an
"Engine" as defined  herein for all purposes  hereunder.  LESSEE  agrees to take
such  action as LESSOR may  reasonably  request  in order that such  Replacement
Engine shall be duly and properly  titled in the name of LESSOR.  Prior to or at
the time of any such conveyance, LESSEE, at its own expense, will promptly:



<PAGE>


     (a) furnish  LESSOR  with a warranty  bill of sale,  in form and  substance
satisfactory to LESSOR, with respect to such Replacement Engine,

     (b) furnish LESSOR with such evidence of title to such  Replacement  Engine
as reasonably requested by LESSOR, and

     (c) furnish  LESSOR with an opinion of LESSEE's  counsel to the effect that
title to such Replacement Engine has been duly conveyed to LESSOR free and clear
of all Security Interests of any kind or nature and that such exchange qualifies
for tax free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

     Upon full compliance with this Article, LESSOR shall transfer to LESSEE all
of LESSOR's right, title and interest, on an "AS-IS", "WHERE-IS" basis in and to
the Engine  being  replaced  by such  Replacement  Engine,  without  recourse or
warranty,  express or implied,  except that LESSOR has good and marketable title
to such Engine and such Engine shall be free and clear of LESSOR's Liens.

     23.7.9 All  Airworthiness  Directives which are issued prior to the date of
return of the Aircraft  and require  compliance  (either by means of  repetitive
inspections,  modifications  or  terminating  action)  prior  to  return  of the
Aircraft to LESSOR or within one (1) year after the  Termination  Date will have
been  complied  with on the Aircraft on a  terminating  action basis at LESSEE's
cost.  Airworthiness  Directives which do not have a terminating  action will be
accomplished  at the highest level of inspection or modification  possible.  If,
after using best  efforts,  LESSEE is unable to acquire the  material,  parts or
components necessary to accomplish such Airworthiness Directive, LESSEE will pay
to LESSOR upon return of the Aircraft the  estimated  cost of  terminating  such
Airworthiness Directive. If the estimated cost cannot be mutually agreed upon by
LESSEE and  LESSOR,  LESSEE  and  LESSOR  will each  obtain an  estimate  from a
reputable FAA-approved maintenance facility (unaffiliated with LESSEE or LESSOR)
and the estimated cost will be the average of the two estimates.

     23.7.10 The Aircraft  will be in compliance  with the Corrosion  Prevention
and Control Program (CPCP) specified in LESSEE's Maintenance Program.



<PAGE>


     23.7.11  If any  waivers,  deviations,  dispensations,  alternate  means of
compliance,  extensions or carry-overs  with respect to maintenance or operating
requirements,  repairs or  Airworthiness  Directives are granted by the Aviation
Authority or permitted by the Maintenance  Program,  LESSEE at its sole cost and
expense will  nonetheless  perform such  maintenance or operating  requirements,
repairs  or   Airworthiness   Directives   as  if  such   waivers,   deviations,
dispensations,  alternate means of compliance,  or extensions or carry-overs did
not exist.

     23.7.12  The  Aircraft  will be free  from  any  Security  Interest  except
LESSOR's Liens and no  circumstance  will have so arisen whereby the Aircraft is
or could become  subject to any Security  Interest or right of detention or sale
in  favor  of the  Aviation  Authority,  any  airport  authority,  or any  other
authority.

     23.7.13 All  no-charge  vendor and  Manufacturer's  service  bulletin  kits
received by LESSEE for the Aircraft but not  installed  thereon will be on board
the Aircraft as cargo. At LESSOR's request, any other service bulletin kit which
LESSEE  paid for will also be  delivered  to LESSOR on board the  Aircraft,  but
LESSOR will reimburse  LESSEE for its actual  out-of-pocket  costs for such kit,
unless  LESSEE  purchased  such kit as part of its  implementation  of a service
bulletin on its fleet of aircraft of the same type as the  Aircraft  but had not
yet installed such kit on the Aircraft, in which case such kit will be furnished
free of charge to LESSOR.

     23.7.14  The  Aircraft  will be free of any leaks and any damage  resulting
therefrom.  All  repairs  will  have  been  performed  on a  permanent  basis in
accordance with the applicable manufacturer's instructions.

     23.7.15 The Aircraft fluid reservoirs (including oil, oxygen, hydraulic and
water) will be serviced to full and the waste tank serviced in  accordance  with
Manufacturer's  instructions.  (Fuel  tanks  will  be at  least  as  full  as at
Delivery.)

     23.8 CHECKS PRIOR TO RETURN. Immediately prior to return of the Aircraft to
LESSOR, LESSEE at its expense will do each of the following:



<PAGE>


     23.8.1 Have performed,  and completed,  by an FAA-approved  repair station,
all  maintenance  tasks  specified in LESSEE's  Maintenance  Program and the MPD
which (a) are  necessary  to clear the  Aircraft of all such tasks for  eighteen
(18) months, five thousand (5,000) hours, and three thousand (3,000) cycles from
the date of return of the  Aircraft,  and (b) are  required to be  performed  at
lesser intervals than eighteen (18) months, five thousand (5,000) hours or three
thousand (3,000) cycles (all such work  collectively  referred to as the "RETURN
CHECK").  If a maintenance task is specific to LESSEE's  Maintenance Program and
not required or  recommended to be performed by the MPD, then LESSEE will not be
required  to  perform  such  maintenance  task so long as the  Return  Check  is
performed in such a manner that clears the Aircraft of all maintenance  tasks in
accordance  with the  requirements  of the  preceding  sentence.  As part of the
Return Check, all non-routine  tasks generated as a result of the performance of
the work  included  in the  Return  Check and any other  discrepancies  revealed
during  the Return  Check  must also be  performed  in  accordance  with the FAA
approved  procedures.  LESSEE  will also weigh the  Aircraft.  LESSEE  agrees to
perform  during the Return  Check any other work  reasonably  required by LESSOR
(and not  otherwise  required  under this Lease) and LESSOR will,  promptly upon
receipt of an invoice  from LESSEE,  reimburse  LESSEE for such work at LESSEE's
preferred customer rates.


     23.8.2 Have the  Aircraft  in  compliance  with  Corrosion  Prevention  and
Control Program (CPCP) as specified in the MPD and LESSEE's Maintenance Program.

     23.8.3 Remove LESSEE's exterior markings,  including all exterior paint, by
stripping (or, at LESSOR's option,  pneumatically  scuff/sanding) the paint from
the fuselage, empennage, wings and Engine cowlings, and clean, reseal, refinish,
prepare  (including  application of alodine or another corrosion  inhibitor) and
prime the surfaces to be painted,  all in  accordance  with  Manufacturer's  and
paint  manufacturer's  recommendations.  LESSEE will then repaint the  fuselage,
empennage,  wings and Engine cowlings in the colors and logo specified by LESSOR
; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that LESSEE will be responsible for only paying the amount
that it  would  cost to strip  or  scuff/sand  (whichever  is  performed  on the
Aircraft at return) and properly paint the Aircraft in LESSEE's  colors and logo
and LESSOR will be responsible  for the excess cost to paint the Aircraft in the
next lessee's  colors and logo.  Such painting  will be  accomplished  in such a
manner  as  to  result  in  a  uniformly  smooth  and  cosmetically   acceptable
aerodynamic surface. All external placards,  signs and markings will be properly
attached, free from damage, clean and legible.

     23.8.4 Clean the exterior and interior of the Aircraft.

     23.8.5 If  reasonably  required  by LESSOR,  apply touch up to paint to the
interior of the  Aircraft,  including  flight  deck,  and replace any missing or
broken placards.

     23.8.6 In accordance with Article 23.7.7,  permanently repair damage to the
Aircraft that exceeds Manufacturer's limits and replace any non-flush structural
patch repairs installed on the Aircraft with flush-type  repairs, so long as the
Manufacturer or the  Manufacturer's  Structural Repair Manual permits flush-type
repairs on the portion of the Aircraft  where the non-flush  structural  repairs
were made.



<PAGE>


     23.8.7  With  LESSOR  or its  representatives  present,  perform a full and
complete hot and cold section videotape borescope on each Engine and its modules
in accordance with the Engine manufacturer's maintenance manual.

     23.8.8 If the Engine  historical  and technical  records  and/or  condition
trend monitoring data of any Engine (including the APU) indicate an acceleration
in the rate of  deterioration  in the  performance  of an  Engine,  LESSEE  will
correct,  to LESSOR's  satisfaction,  such conditions which are determined to be
causing such accelerated rate of deterioration.

     23.8.9 With LESSOR or its  representatives  present,  accomplish  a maximum
power assurance run on the Engines.  LESSEE will evaluate the Engine performance
and record the Engine maximum power assurance test conditions and results on the
Return Acceptance Receipt.

     23.8.10  LESSEE will  provide  evidence to LESSOR's  satisfaction  that the
Engine historical and technical records, borescope inspection,  trend monitoring
and other checks  specified in Article 23.8.9 do not reveal any condition  which
would cause the Engines or any module to be  unserviceable,  beyond  serviceable
limits or serviceable with an increased frequency of inspection or with calendar
time, flight hour or flight cycle restrictions  under the Engine  manufacturer's
maintenance manual. LESSEE will correct any discrepancies in accordance with the
guidelines  set out by the Engine  manufacturer  which may be discovered  during
such inspection.

     23.8.11 In the event the Engine historical and technical records, borescope
inspection, trend monitoring and other checks specified in Article 23.8.9 result
in a dispute regarding the conformity of an Engine with the requirements of this
Article 23, LESSEE and LESSOR will consult with Engine  manufacturer  and follow
Engine manufacturer's recommendations (including the accomplishment of an Engine
test cell operational  check) with regard to determining if such Engine complies
with  the  requirements  of  this  Article  23  and  the  manner  in  which  any
discrepancies from the requirements of this Article 23 will be rectified.

     23.9 PART  LIVES.  At return,  the  condition  of the  Aircraft  will be as
follows:



<PAGE>


(CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL OMITTED)

     23.10 EXPORT AND DEREGISTRATION OF AIRCRAFT. At LESSOR's request, LESSEE at
its cost  will  (a)  provide  an  Export  Certificate  of  Airworthiness  or its
equivalent  from the State of  Registration so that the Aircraft can be exported
to the  country  designated  by LESSOR,  (b) assist with  deregistration  of the
Aircraft from the register of aircraft in the State of Registration,  (c) assist
with arranging for prompt  confirmation of such deregistration to be sent by the
registry in the State of Registration  to the next country of  registration  and
(d) perform any other acts reasonably  required by LESSOR in connection with the
foregoing.  If any  Aircraft  work which  LESSEE is not  otherwise  required  to
perform hereunder,  including  engineering,  is required in order to obtain such
Export  Certificate of  Airworthiness,  LESSEE will perform such work and LESSOR
will reimburse LESSEE for such work at LESSEE's preferred customer rates.

     23.11 LESSEE'S  CONTINUING  OBLIGATIONS.  In the event that LESSEE does not
return  the  Aircraft  to LESSOR  on the  Expiration  Date and in the  condition
required by this Article 23 for any reason  (whether or not the reason is within
LESSEE's control):

     23.11.1 the  obligations  of LESSEE under this Lease will  continue in full
force and  effect on a  day-to-day  basis  until such  return.  This will not be
considered  a  waiver  of  LESSEE's  Event of  Default  or any  right of  LESSOR
hereunder.



<PAGE>


     23.11.2 Until such return,  the Agreed Value will be an amount equal to the
Agreed  Value on the day the  Aircraft  should  have  been  returned  to  LESSOR
pursuant to this Lease.

     23.11.3  LESSEE  will  fully  indemnify  LESSOR  on demand  for all  losses
(including consequential damages), liabilities,  actions, proceedings, costs and
expenses thereby suffered or incurred by LESSOR and, in addition,  if a delay in
return of the Aircraft was due to reasons within  LESSEE's  reasonable  control,
then until such time as the Aircraft is  redelivered  to LESSOR and put into the
condition  required by this Article 23,  instead of paying the Rent specified in
Article  5.3,  LESSEE  will pay twice  the  amount of Rent for each day from the
scheduled  Expiration Date until the Termination  Date (the monthly Rent payable
under Article  5.3.1 will be prorated  based on the actual number of days in the
applicable month). Payment will be made upon presentation of LESSOR's invoice.

     23.11.4 LESSOR may elect,  in its sole and absolute  discretion,  to accept
the return of the  Aircraft  prior to the  Aircraft  being put in the  condition
required  by this  Article  23 and  thereafter  have  any  such  non-conformance
corrected at such time as LESSOR may deem  appropriate  (but within  ninety (90)
days following the return of the Aircraft) and at commercial rates  then-charged
by the Person selected by LESSOR to perform such correction. Any direct expenses
incurred by LESSOR for such  correction  will become  additional Rent payable by
LESSEE within fifteen (15) days following the submission of a written  statement
by LESSOR to LESSEE,  identifying  the items  corrected  and  setting  forth the
expense of such corrections.  LESSEE's  obligation to pay such supplemental Rent
will survive the Termination Date.

     23.12 AIRPORT AND NAVIGATION CHARGES.  LESSEE will ensure that at return of
the Aircraft any and all airport,  navigation  and other charges which give rise
or may if unpaid  give rise to any lien,  right of  detention,  right of sale or
other  Security  Interest in relation to the  Aircraft,  Engine or any Part have
been paid and discharged in full and will at LESSOR's  request produce  evidence
thereof satisfactory to LESSOR.

     23.13  RETURN  ACCEPTANCE  CERTIFICATE.  Upon  return  of the  Aircraft  in
accordance with the terms of this Lease, LESSEE will prepare and execute two (2)
Return Acceptance Certificates in the form and substance of Exhibit I and LESSOR
will countersign and return one such Return Acceptance Certificate to LESSEE. In
addition, LESSEE and LESSOR will execute a Lease Termination for filing with the
FAA evidencing termination of this Lease.



<PAGE>


     23.14 INDEMNITIES AND INSURANCE. The indemnities and insurance requirements
set forth in Articles 16 and 17,  respectively,  will apply to  Indemnitees  and
LESSOR's  representatives  during return of the  Aircraft,  including the ground
inspection  and  acceptance  flight.  With  respect  to the  acceptance  flight,
LESSOR's representatives will receive the same protections as LESSOR on LESSEE's
Aviation and Airline General Third Party Liability Insurance.

     ARTICLE 24 ASSIGNMENT



     24.1 NO ASSIGNMENT BY LESSEE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE  SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED BY
THE TERMS OF THIS LEASE, NO ASSIGNMENT,  NOVATION,  TRANSFER,  MORTGAGE OR OTHER
CHARGE MAY BE MADE BY LESSEE OF ANY OF ITS RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE  AIRCRAFT,
ENGINE OR PART OF THIS LEASE.

     24.2 SALE OR ASSIGNMENT BY LESSOR.

     24.2.1 Subject to LESSEE's rights pursuant to this Lease, LESSOR may at any
time and without LESSEE's consent sell, assign or transfer its rights,  interest
and  obligations  hereunder  or with  respect to the  Aircraft  to a third party
("LESSOR'S ASSIGNEE"), but only if:

     (a)  LESSOR's  Assignee  has full  power,  authority,  and  legal  right to
execute,  deliver,  and perform the  obligations  of LESSOR under the  Operative
Documents  and  provides  reasonably  satisfactory  evidence  of such  power and
authority to LESSEE;

     (b) LESSOR's  Assignee  enters into one or more legal,  valid,  binding and
enforceable  agreements effective to confirm that LESSOR's Assignee agrees to be
bound by all the terms of, and to undertake all of the obligations arising after
such  transfer  of LESSOR in,  the  Operative  Documents,  and in which it makes
representations  and warranties  substantially the same as those in Article 21.1
of this Lease;

     (c) upon such  transfer  LESSEE  shall not be  obligated to pay any greater
amount or incur any  greater  obligation  (other  than  indemnifying  additional
indemnitees,  insuring additional insureds and other minor ministerial  matters)
than that which it would have been  obliged to pay or incur under the  Operative
Documents if no transfer or assignment  had taken place,  and upon such transfer
the terms and  conditions of the Operative  Documents  insofar as they relate to
the rights and obligations of LESSEE are not altered;



<PAGE>


     (d) LESSOR shall cause LESSOR's Assignee to deliver to LESSEE an opinion of
counsel  reasonably  satisfactory to LESSEE to the effect that such agreement or
agreements  referred to in clause (2) and, if applicable,  clause (6) are legal,
binding,  and enforceable in accordance with its or their terms,  subject to the
typical exceptions.

     (e) the  transfer  shall  relate to  LESSOR's  entire  interest as owner or
lessor;

     (f) LESSOR's  Assignee is a citizen of the United States under 49 U.S. Code
ss.40102(a)(15) (such status to be determined without considering FAR ss.47.9 or
any  other  provision  that  may  restrict  LESSEE's  use  or  operation  of the
Aircraft), or shall use a voting powers trust or similar arrangement in order to
hold an interest in the Aircraft such that the Aircraft can be registered in the
U.S.  (without  considering FAR ss.47.9 or any other provision that may restrict
LESSEE's use or operation of the Aircraft);

     (g)  LESSOR's  Assignee  is a single  Person and is either (i) a  Permitted
Institution,  or  (ii)  or an  affiliate  of a  Permitted  Institution,  if such
affiliate's  obligations  under the Operative  Documents are  guaranteed by such
Permitted  Institution  pursuant to a written  guaranty,  in form and  substance
reasonably satisfactory to LESSEE; and

     (h)  LESSOR  shall  give  written  notice to LESSEE at least  five (5) days
before  any such  transfer,  specifying  the name and  address  of the  proposed
LESSOR's  Assignee,  and  providing  reasonably  satisfactory  evidence that the
proposed  LESSOR's   Assignee  meets  the  requirements   described  in  Article
24.2.1(g)(i) or (ii).

     For a period of two (2) years after such sale or assignment and at LESSEE's
cost,  LESSEE will  continue to name LESSOR as an  additional  insured under the
Aviation and Airline General Third Party Liability  Insurance  required pursuant
to Article 17 and Exhibit C.

     24.2.2  The term  "LESSOR"  as used in this  Lease  means the lessor of the
Aircraft at the time in  question.  In the event of the sale of the Aircraft and
transfer of LESSOR's rights and obligations under this Lease,  LESSOR's Assignee
will become "LESSOR" of the Aircraft under this Lease and the transferring party
(the prior  "LESSOR")  will be relieved of all  liability  to LESSEE  under this
Lease for obligations arising on and after the date the Aircraft is sold. LESSEE
will  acknowledge  and accept  LESSOR's  Assignee as the new "LESSOR" under this
Lease and will look  solely to  LESSOR's  Assignee  for the  performance  of all
LESSOR  obligations  and  covenants  under this  Lease  arising on and after the
Aircraft sale date.



<PAGE>


     24.3 LESSOR'S  LENDER.  Subject to LESSEE's  rights pursuant to this Lease,
LESSOR may at any time and without  LESSEE's  consent grant  security  interests
over the  Aircraft  and assign the benefit of this Lease to a lender  ("LESSOR'S
LENDER") as security for LESSOR's  obligations to LESSOR's Lender.  Accordingly,
if  LESSOR's  Lender  requires,  as a  condition  to  providing  financing,  any
nonsubstantive  modification  of this  Lease,  LESSEE  agrees  to enter  into an
agreement so modifying this Lease.

     24.4  LESSEE  COOPERATION.  On  request  by LESSOR,  LESSOR's  Assignee  or
LESSOR's  Lender,  LESSEE  will  execute  all  such  documents  (such as a lease
assignment  agreement)  as LESSOR,  LESSOR's  Assignee  or  LESSOR's  Lender may
reasonably  require to confirm LESSEE's  obligations under this Lease and obtain
LESSEE's acknowledgment that to the best of LESSEE's knowledge, LESSOR is not in
breach of this Lease.  LESSEE will provide all other  reasonable  assistance and
cooperation to LESSOR,  LESSOR's Assignee and LESSOR's Lender in connection with
any such  sale or  assignment  or the  perfection  and  maintenance  of any such
security interest,  at LESSOR's cost, including making all necessary filings and
registrations in the State of Registration and providing all opinions of counsel
with  respect to matters  reasonably  requested  by LESSOR,  LESSOR's  Lender or
LESSOR's Assignee. LESSOR will reimburse LESSEE for its reasonable out-of-pocket
costs in reviewing documents required by LESSOR or LESSOR's Lender.

     24.5 PROTECTIONS.

     24.5.1 LESSOR will obtain for the benefit of LESSEE an acknowledgment  from
any LESSOR's  Assignee or LESSOR's  Lender that,  so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing  hereunder,  such Person will not interfere  with
LESSEE's quiet, peaceful use and enjoyment of the Aircraft.

     24.5.2  Wherever the term "LESSOR" is used in this Lease in relation to any
of the provisions relating to disclaimer, title and registration,  indemnity and
insurance contained in Articles 8, 13, 16 and 17, respectively,  or with respect
to Article 20.2.7, the term "LESSOR" will be deemed to include LESSOR's Assignee
and LESSOR's  Lender,  if  applicable.  For avoidance of doubt,  in the event of
LESSOR's  sale or  financing  of the  Aircraft,  the  disclaimer  and  indemnity
provisions  contained in Articles 8 and 16 will continue to be applicable  after
the sale or assignment to International  Lease Finance  Corporation,  as well as
being applicable to LESSOR's Assignee and LESSOR's Lender.

     (f) any  representation  or warranty of LESSEE  herein  proves to have been

falsity  is  curable,  LESSEE  shall  have  thirty  (30) days  after  LESSEE has
knowledge that the representation or warranty is untrue;

an act or omission of LESSOR;

     (h) LESSEE abandons the Aircraft or Engines;

or insolvent or (iv) enters into any  composition or other  arrangement  for the
benefit of its creditors generally;

     (n) any  proceedings,  resolutions,  filings or other steps are  instituted
with respect to LESSEE relating to the bankruptcy,  liquidation,  reorganization
or protection from creditors of LESSEE or at least half of LESSEE's property. If

     (o) any order,  judgment  or decree is  entered  by any court of  competent

be an Event of Default if not dismissed, stayed, remedied or relinquished within
sixty (60) days; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such proceeding is stayed, then such
proceeding  will become an immediate Event of Default if such stay is removed or
terminates and the proceeding is not dismissed,  remedied or  relinquished  when
such stay is removed or terminates.

     (p)  any  indebtedness  for  borrowed  moneys  or a  guarantee  or  similar

<PAGE>


     (q)  Eurocontrol  has  notified  LESSOR  that there are unpaid  Eurocontrol
charges due from LESSEE  (unless such charges are being  contested in good faith
and by  appropriate  proceedings,  an adequate  bond has been  provided and such
proceedings  do not involve any danger of the detention,  interference  with the
use or  operation,  sale,  forfeiture  or loss of the Aircraft) and such charges
remain  outstanding  for  a  period  of  thirty  (30)  days  from  the  date  of

     (e) terminate this Lease by taking possession of the Aircraft or by serving
notice  requiring  LESSEE  to return  the  Aircraft  to  LESSOR at the  location
specified by LESSOR.  If LESSOR takes  possession of the Aircraft,  it may enter
upon LESSEE's  premises where the Aircraft is located  without  liability.  Upon
repossession  of the  Aircraft,  LESSOR will then be entitled to sell,  lease or
otherwise  deal with the  Aircraft as if this Lease had never been made.  LESSOR
will be entitled to the full benefit of its bargain with LESSEE; or

     (f) apply all or any portion of the Security Deposit and any other security
deposits  held by LESSOR  pursuant to any other  agreements  between  LESSOR and
LESSEE to any amounts due.



<PAGE>


     25.4  DEREGISTRATION  AND EXPORT OF  AIRCRAFT.  If an Event of Default  has
occurred and is  continuing,  LESSOR may take all steps  necessary to deregister
the Aircraft in and export the Aircraft from the State of Registration.

     25.5  LESSEE  LIABILITY  FOR  DAMAGES.  If an Event of Default  occurs,  in
addition to all other  remedies  available  at law or in equity,  LESSOR has the
right to recover from LESSEE and LESSEE will pay LESSOR  within two (2) Business
Days after LESSOR's written demand, all of the following:

     (a) all amounts  which are then due and unpaid  hereunder  and which become
due prior to the earlier of LESSOR's  recovery of  possession of the Aircraft or
LESSEE making an effective tender thereof;

     (b) any losses  suffered by LESSOR  because of LESSOR's  inability to place
the Aircraft on lease with another  lessee or to otherwise  utilize the Aircraft
on  financial  terms as  favorable  to LESSOR as the terms  hereof or, if LESSOR
elects  to  dispose  of the  Aircraft,  the funds  arising  from a sale or other
disposition  of the  Aircraft  are not as  profitable  to LESSOR as leasing  the
Aircraft in accordance with the terms hereof would have been (and LESSOR will be
entitled to accelerate  any and all Rent which would have been due from the date
of LESSOR's  recovery or  repossession  of the Aircraft  through the  Expiration
Date);

     (c) all costs associated with LESSOR's exercise of its remedies  hereunder,
including but not limited to repossession  costs,  legal fees,  Aircraft storage
costs,  Aircraft re-lease or sale costs and LESSOR's internal costs and expenses
(including the cost of personnel  time  calculated  based upon the  compensation
paid to the  individuals  involved  on an  annual  basis  and a  general  LESSOR
overhead allocation);

     (d) any amount of principal,  interest,  fees or other sums paid or payable
on account of funds borrowed in order to carry any unpaid amount;

     (e) any loss, premium, penalty or expense which may be incurred in repaying
funds raised to finance the Aircraft or in unwinding  any  financial  instrument
relating in whole or in part to LESSOR's financing of the Aircraft;

     (f) any loss,  cost,  expense  or  liability  sustained  by  LESSOR  due to
LESSEE's  failure to redeliver  the Aircraft in the  condition  required by this
Lease; and



<PAGE>


     (g) any other loss, damage, expense, cost or liability which LESSOR suffers
or incurs as a result of the Event of Default and/or  termination of this Lease,
including an amount  sufficient  to fully  compensate  LESSOR for any loss of or
damage to LESSOR's residual interest in the Aircraft caused by LESSEE's default.

     25.6  WAIVER OF  DEFAULT.  By written  notice to LESSEE,  LESSOR may at its
election waive any Default or Event of Default and its  consequences and rescind
and annul any prior notice of termination of this Lease.  The respective  rights
of the  parties  will then be as they would have been had no Default or Event of
Default occurred and no such notice been given.

     25.7 PRESENT VALUE OF PAYMENTS.  In calculating LESSOR's damages hereunder,
upon an Event of Default  all Rent and other  amounts  which would have been due
hereunder  during the Lease Term if an Event of Default had not occurred will be
calculated on a present value basis using a discounting rate of six percent (6%)
per  annum  discounted  to the  earlier  of the  date on  which  LESSOR  obtains
possession of the Aircraft or LESSEE makes an effective tender thereof.

     25.8 USE OF "TERMINATION  DATE".  For avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that
if this Lease  terminates  and the Aircraft is  repossessed  by LESSOR due to an
Event of Default,  then,  notwithstanding the use of the term "Termination Date"
in this Lease,  the period of the Lease Term and the  "Expiration  Date" will be
utilized  in  calculating  the damages to which  LESSOR is entitled  pursuant to
Article 25.5. For example,  it is agreed and understood  that LESSOR is entitled
to receive  from  LESSEE  the Rent and the  benefit of  LESSEE's  insurance  and
maintenance of the Aircraft until expiration of the Lease Term.

payment or release of payment is payable to LESSEE.

     28.4  APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.  Any amounts paid or recovered in respect of
LESSEE liabilities  hereunder may be applied to Rent, Default Interest,  fees or
any other amount due hereunder in such  proportions,  order and manner as LESSOR
determines.

     28.5 USURY LAWS. The parties intend to contract in strict  compliance  with
the usury Laws of the State of  California  and, to the extent  applicable,  the
U.S. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Operative Documents, LESSEE
will not be obligated to pay Default Interest or other interest in excess of the
maximum non-usurious interest rate, as in effect from time to time, which may by
applicable Law be charged,  contracted for,  reserved,  received or collected by
LESSOR in connection with the Operative Documents.  During any period of time in
which the then-applicable highest lawful rate is lower than the Default Interest
rate,  Default  Interest will accrue and be payable at such highest lawful rate;
however,  if at later times such highest lawful rate is greater than the Default
Interest rate, then LESSEE will pay Default  Interest at the highest lawful rate
until the Default Interest which is paid by LESSEE equals the amount of interest
that would have been payable in  accordance  with the interest rate set forth in
Article 5.5.

     28.6 DELEGATION BY LESSOR.  LESSOR may delegate to any Person(s) all or any
of the  rights,  powers or  discretion  vested in it by this  Lease and any such
delegation  may be made upon such terms and conditions as LESSOR in its absolute
discretion thinks fit.

     28.7   CONFIDENTIALITY.   The  Operative   Documents  and  all   non-public
information  obtained by either party about the other are  confidential  and are
between  LESSOR and LESSEE  only and will not be  disclosed  by a party to third
parties (other than to such party's auditors or legal advisors or as required in
connection with any filings of this Lease in accordance with Article 13) without
the prior  written  consent of the other party.  If  disclosure is required as a
result of applicable  Law,  LESSEE and LESSOR will cooperate with one another to
obtain  confidential  treatment as to the  commercial  terms and other  material
provisions of this Lease.

     28.8 RIGHTS OF PARTIES. The rights of the parties hereunder are cumulative,
not exclusive, may be exercised as often as each party considers appropriate and
are in addition to its rights under general Law. The rights of one party against
the other party are not capable of being waived or amended  except by an express
waiver  or  amendment  in  writing.  Any  failure  to  exercise  or any delay in
exercising  any of such rights will not operate as a waiver or amendment of that
or any other such right any  defective  or partial  exercise  of any such rights
will not preclude any other or further  exercise of that or any other such right
and no act or course  of  conduct  or  negotiation  on a party's  part or on its
behalf will in any way  preclude  such party from  exercising  any such right or
constitute a suspension or any amendment of any such right.

     28.9  FURTHER  ASSURANCES.  Each party  agrees  from time to time to do and
perform  such other and  further  acts and  execute and deliver any and all such
other  instruments  as may be  required  by  Law,  reasonably  requested  by the
auditors  of the  other  party or  requested  by the other  party to  establish,
maintain or protect the rights and remedies of the requesting  party or to carry
out and effect the intent and purpose of this Lease.

     28.10 USE OF WORD "INCLUDING".  The term "INCLUDING" is used herein without
limitation.

     28.11 HEADINGS.  All article and paragraph headings and captions are purely
for  convenience  and will not  affect the  interpretation  of this  Lease.  Any
reference to a specific  article,  paragraph or section will be interpreted as a
reference to such article, paragraph or section of this Lease.

     28.12  INVALIDITY OF ANY PROVISION.  If any of the provisions of this Lease
become  invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable  in any respect  under any Law,  the
validity,  legality and  enforceability of the remaining  provisions will not in
any way be affected or impaired.

     28.13  NEGOTIATION.  The terms of this Lease are agreed by LESSOR  from its
principal place of business in Los Angeles, California.



<PAGE>


     28.14 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.  Time is of the essence in the performance of
all  obligations  of the parties  under this Lease and,  consequently,  all time
limitations set forth in the provisions of this Lease will be strictly observed.

     28.15  AMENDMENTS  IN  WRITING.  The  provisions  of this Lease may only be
amended or modified by a writing executed by LESSOR and LESSEE.

     28.16  COUNTERPARTS.  This Lease may be executed in any number of identical
counterparts,  each of which will be deemed to be an original,  and all of which
together  will be deemed to be one and the same  instrument  when each party has
signed and delivered one such counterpart to the other party.

     28.17 DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS BY FAX. Delivery of an executed  counterpart of
this Lease or of any other  documents in connection  with this Lease by fax will
be deemed as effective as delivery of an originally  executed  counterpart.  Any
party delivering an executed  counterpart of this Lease or other document by fax
will also deliver an  originally  executed  counterpart,  but the failure of any
party to deliver an originally executed  counterpart of this Lease or such other
document  will not affect the  validity or  effectiveness  of this Lease or such
other document.

     28.18 ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  The  Operative  Documents  constitute  the entire
agreement  between the  parties in  relation  to the leasing of the  Aircraft by
LESSOR to LESSEE and  supersede  all previous  proposals,  agreements  and other
written and oral communications in relation hereto. The parties acknowledge that
there  have  been  no  representations,   warranties,  promises,  guarantees  or
agreements,  express  or  implied,  except as set forth  herein and in the other
Operative Documents.

                       Relating to Boeing 737-800 Aircraft

     THIS  AGENCY  AGREEMENT  ("AGREEMENT")  is  made  and  entered  into  as of
____________________.

         BETWEEN:

     AMERICAN TRANS AIR, INC., a Indiana corporation whose address and principal
place of business is at 7337 West Washington Street,  Indianapolis International
Airport, Indianapolis, Indiana 46231, United States of America ("AGENT") and

     INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION,  a California  corporation,  whose
address and  principal  place of  business is at 1999 Avenue of the Stars,  39th
Floor, Los Angeles, California 90067, U.S.A. ("BUYER").

         RECITAL

     The Boeing  Company  ("MANUFACTURER")  and Buyer have entered into Purchase
Agreement  2241,  dated as of July 30, 1999 (such  purchase  agreement as may be
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof is hereinafter  referred to as
the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT") under which Manufacturer has agreed to manufacture and
sell and Buyer has agreed to purchase certain Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Buyer has
agreed to lease one (1) of such aircraft  bearing  manufacturer's  serial number
30643 (the  "AIRCRAFT")  to the Agent  pursuant to an Aircraft  Lease  Agreement
between Buyer and Agent dated as of September 5, 2000 (the "LEASE").

     The Agent is engaged in business as a commercial air carrier and intends to
lease the Aircraft from Buyer,  and Buyer is desirous of utilizing the expertise
of the Agent as Buyer's  agent in all  matters to which the  Purchase  Agreement
relates with respect to the Aircraft  except  certain items as indicated  below,
and the Agent, as Buyer's agent, is willing to make such expertise  available to
Buyer.

     Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:



<PAGE>


     1. Buyer hereby appoints the Agent as Buyer's sole and exclusive agent with
authority to perform the following,  on behalf of Buyer, as the Agent may in its
discretion determine to be necessary or desirable:

     (a) monitor Manufacturer's production, testing and delivery of the Aircraft
in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and

     (b) do all such other things permitted by the Purchase Agreement related to
the  technical  and  engineering  aspects of  Manufacturer's  production  of the
Aircraft, except Buyer limits Agent's authority to perform on behalf of Buyer on
any defect that occurs  during  manufacture  that is considered  significant  in
nature by Buyer as measured by the criteria set forth below.  Buyer  retains the
sole authority to perform on any defect meeting such criteria.

     (i)  Deviations  from the drawing  configuration  that could affect  future
modifications, maintenance, repair or overhaul of the Aircraft;

     (ii) Defects that are obvious appearance items;

     (iii) Rework that requires  stress  concurrence  to satisfy  Manufacturer's
Material Review Board (MRB) requirements;

     (iv) A high  quantity of defects  normally  considered  minor on a singular
basis;

     (v)  Major  rework  requiring   extensive  repair  or  modification,   E.G.
replacement of ---- skin panels, extensive use of oversize fasteners,  repair of
damaged areas and significant structural modifications;

     (vi) Rework that affects the aerodynamic  drag coefficient of the Aircraft;
or

     (vii) Rework that involves areas known to be sensitive to Buyer.

     2.  Notwithstanding  anything in the  provisions of paragraph 1, nothing in
this Agreement will confer authority upon or otherwise permit the Agent:

     (a) to exercise any power of termination under the Purchase Agreement or



<PAGE>


     (b) to make any  payments due from Buyer to  Manufacturer  or to receive on
behalf of Buyer any payments due from Manufacturer under the Purchase Agreement,
or to alter any of the terms and  conditions  of the  Purchase  Agreement or the
Detail Specifications of the Aircraft.

     3. Buyer will not revoke the  appointment  of and  authority  granted under
this  Agreement to the Agent unless a termination  of the Purchase  Agreement or
Lease has  occurred  with  respect  to the  Aircraft  or the Agent has failed to
perform  a  material  obligation  under  this  Agreement.  Notice  of  any  such
revocation  will be provided in accordance  with the provisions of Article 14 of
the Purchase Agreement and given to both Manufacturer and the Agent.

     4.  Manufacturer  acknowledges the appointment of the Agent for the purpose
set forth  hereunder and  Manufacturer  and Buyer agree that due  performance by
Manufacturer  or  Agent of an  obligation  under  the  Purchase  Agreement  will
constitute due satisfaction of such obligation by such party and Buyer agrees to
be bound by the acts of the Agent.

     5. Buyer and Agent  agree to identify  the  technical  organization  and/or
person(s) with the limited  authority to act for Agent during  production of the
Aircraft.  Buyer will, if possible,  provide such identification to Manufacturer
in writing,  along with office space requirements for Agent, if required,  prior
to or at the time of Manufacturer's acknowledgment of this Agreement.

     6. Nothing in this  Agreement  will subject  Manufacturer  to any liability
under the  Purchase  Agreement  which it would not  otherwise  be subject to, or
modify  Manufacturer's  rights  thereunder,  or require  Manufacturer  to divest
itself of title to or  possession  of  Aircraft or any other  property  which is
subject to the Purchase Agreement until payment therefor and delivery thereof in
accordance with the Purchase Agreement.

     7. None of the parties hereto will be entitled to assign to any third party
any of their rights under this Agreement.

     8. The Agent will not  delegate to any third party the  performance  of the
obligations imposed on it by this Agreement or appoint a sub-agent.

     9.   References  to   Manufacturer  in  this  Agreement  will  include  any
wholly-owned subsidiary of Manufacturer to which Manufacturer assigns any of its
rights and obligations  under the Purchase  Agreement  pursuant to the terms and
conditions thereof.

     10. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California;
however,  the Purchase  Agreement shall remain governed by the laws of the State
of Washington.

Lease are terminated by any action of the Insured or LESSOR and in consideration
of the  Additional  Premium it is confirmed  that the Insurance  afforded by the
Policy is in full force and effect and it is further  agreed that the  following
provisions are specifically endorsed to the Policy.

           1. UNDER THE HULL (ALL RISKS AND HULL WAR AND ALLIED RISKS)
 AND AIRCRAFT SPARES INSURANCES




                (a) In respect of any claim on the Aircraft that becomes payable
         on the basis of a Total Loss,  payment of any  settlement  will be made
         to, or to the order of LESSOR  as sole  loss  payee,  up to the  Agreed
         Value.  With  respect to  repairable  damage to an  Aircraft or Engine,
         LESSOR will receive all  insurance  proceeds in excess of  CONFIDENTIAL
         MATERIAL  OMITTED provided that upon receipt by the insurance broker of
         written  notice of a material  default on the part of LESSEE (and until
         notice that it has been cured),  all insurance proceeds which otherwise
         would be payable to LESSEE will be made directly to LESSOR.  In respect
         of any other  claim,  payment of any  settlement  (net of any  relevant
         policy  deductible)  will  be  made  with  such  party(ies)  as  may be
         necessary  to  repair  the  Aircraft  unless   otherwise  agreed  after
         consultation  between the Insurers and the Insured and, where necessary
         under the terms of the Lease,  LESSOR.  Such payments will only be made
         provided  they  are  in  compliance   with  all  applicable   laws  and
         regulations.

                (b)    Insurers agree on a 50/50 settlement in terms of AVS 103.

                (c)  Insurers  have no right to replace the  Aircraft on a Total
         Loss (arranged, constructive or otherwise).



<PAGE>


                (d) Insurers confirm that under the insurance  policies,  if the
         Insured  installs  an engine  owned by a third  party on the  Aircraft,
         either  (i) the hull  insurance  will  automatically  increase  to such
         higher  amount  as is  necessary  in order  to  satisfy  both  LESSOR's
         requirement  to receive the Agreed  Value in the event of a Total Loss,
         Constructive  Total Loss or Arranged Total Loss and the amount required
         by the third party engine owner, or (ii) separate additional  insurance
         on  such  engine  will  attach  in  order  to  satisfy  separately  the
         requirements of the Insured to such third party engine owner.

         2.     UNDER THE LEGAL LIABILITY INSURANCE



                (a) Subject to the provisions of this Endorsement, the Insurance
         will  operate in all  respects as if a separate  Policy had been issued
         covering  each party insured  hereunder,  but this  provision  will not
         operate to include any claim  arising  howsoever  in respect of loss or
         damage to the Aircraft  insured  under the Hull or Spares  Insurance of
         the  Insured.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  the total  liability of
         Insurers in respect of any and all Insureds  will not exceed the limits
         of liability stated in the Policy.

                (b) The Insurance provided hereunder will be primary and without
         right of  contribution  from any other insurance which may be available
         to LESSOR.

         3.     UNDER ALL INSURANCES



                (a) LESSOR,  its  successors  and assigns,  and (with respect to
         Aviation and Airline General Third Party Liability only) its directors,
         officers and employees for their respective  rights and interests,  are
         included as Additional Insureds.

                (b) The cover  afforded  to LESSOR by the  Policy in  accordance
         with this  Endorsement  will not be  invalidated by any act or omission
         (including misrepresentation and non-disclosure) of any other person or
         party which  results in a breach of any term,  condition or warranty of
         the Policy.

                (c) LESSOR will have no responsibility  for premium and insurers
         will waive any right of set-off or  counterclaim  against LESSOR except
         in respect of outstanding premium in respect of the Aircraft,  provided
         that Insurer may only set-off for premiums  against the proceeds of the
         hull  insurance for  outstanding  premiums in connection  with hull all
         risks and hull war and allied perils insurance.



<PAGE>


                (d) Upon payment of any loss or claim to or on behalf of LESSOR,
         Insurers will to the extent and in respect of such payment be thereupon
         subrogated  to all legal  and  equitable  rights of LESSOR  indemnified
         hereby (but not against LESSOR). Insurers will not exercise such rights
         without  the  consent  of those  indemnified,  such  consent  not to be
         unreasonably  withheld.  At the expense of Insurers  LESSOR will do all
         things  reasonably  necessary to assist the  Insurers to exercise  said
         rights.

                (e) Except in  respect  of any  provision  for  Cancellation  or
         Automatic  Termination  specified  in the  Policy  or  any  endorsement
         thereof,  cover provided by this  Endorsement  may only be cancelled or
         materially  altered in a manner  adverse to LESSOR by the giving of not
         less than thirty (30) days notice in writing to LESSOR.  Notice will be
         deemed to commence  from the date such notice is given by the Insurers.
         Such notice will NOT,  however,  be given at normal  expiry date of the
         Policy or any endorsement.

         4.     EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY VARIED OR PROVIDED BY THE TERMS
 OF THIS CERTIFICATE



                (a)    LESSOR IS COVERED BY THE POLICY SUBJECT TO ALL TERMS,
         CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS,WARRANTIES, EXCLUSIONS AND CANCELLATION

Dear Sirs:

         We confirm that insurance has been effected for the account of [LESSEE]
(the "OPERATOR")  covering all aircraft owned or operated by them, including the
above-referenced  aircraft (the "Aircraft").  [Also confirm, if applicable,  the
amount of any hull all risks or hull war and allied perils on the Aircraft which
LESSEE is carrying in excess of the Agreed Value (which excess  insurance  would
be payable to LESSEE). Such excess insurance may not exceed ten percent (10%) of
the Agreed Value.]

         Pursuant  to   instructions   received   from  the   Operator   and  in
consideration of your approving the arrangement of the Operator's "Fleet Policy"
(under which the above-referenced  Aircraft is insured) through the intermediary
of ourselves  as Brokers in  connection  with the  insurance  (the  "INSURANCE")
mentioned  in our  Certificate  of  Insurance  (Reference  No. [ ] dated [ ] and
attached hereto), we undertake as follows:

         1. In  relation  to the Hull and War  Risks  Insurance  to hold to your
order the insurance  Slips or Contracts and any Policies  which may be issued or
any policies  substituted  (with your consent) therefor (but only insofar as the
same  relate to the  Aircraft  only) and the  benefit  of the Hull and War Risks
Insurance  thereunder,  but  subject to our  requirements  to operate  the Fleet
Policy insofar as it relates to any other aircraft insured thereunder.

         2.     To advise you of any of the following:



<PAGE>


                (a) If any insurer  cancels or gives notice of  cancellation  of
         any of the  Insurance at least thirty (30) days (or such lesser  period
         as may be available in the case of War and Allied  Perils)  before such
         cancellation is to take effect in respect of the Aircraft.

                (b)  Of  any  act  or  omission  or  of  any  event   (including
         non-payment  of premium) of which we have knowledge or are notified and
         which might invalidate or render  unenforceable in whole or in part any
         of the Insurance, insofar as the same relate to the Aircraft.

                (c) If we do not receive instructions to renew all or any of the
         Insurance at least thirty (30) days prior to their expiration.

                (d) If any of the  Insurance  are not  renewed on the same terms
         (save as to premium and period of cover and as you might otherwise have
         notified  us to be  acceptable  to you)  seven (7) days prior to expiry
         thereof.

         The above undertakings are given subject to our continuing  appointment
for the time being as Insurance Brokers to the Operator.

         We also undertake to advise you if we cease to be Insurance  Brokers to
the Operator.

         EXHIBIT F            OPINION OF COUNSEL



     TO BE GIVEN BY  INDEPENDENT  OUTSIDE  COUNSEL  OF LESSEE  OR OTHER  LAWYERS
ACCEPTABLE TO LESSOR

To:             International Lease Finance Corporation
                1999 Avenue of the Stars, 39th Floor
                Los Angeles, California 90067
                United States

Gentlemen:

         This  opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Article 7 of the Aircraft
Lease  Agreement  dated as of September 5, 2000 (the "LEASE")  between  AMERICAN
TRANS  AIR,  INC.   ("LESSEE")  and  INTERNATIONAL   LEASE  FINANCE  CORPORATION
("LESSOR").  Defined  terms in this  opinion  are used  herein as defined in the
Lease.

         I have acted as counsel for LESSEE in connection with the  preparation,
execution and delivery of the Lease.

     In that connection I have examined:

     (a) The Lease and Estoppel and Acceptance Certificate;

     (b) The charter of LESSEE and all amendments  thereto (the "CHARTER");  and

     (c) Such other documents,  agreements and  instruments,  and such treaties,
laws, rules, regulations,  decrees and the like, as I have deemed necessary as a
basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.

     [ (d) All of the agreements and any amendments  thereto  between LESSEE and
all other  lessors and lenders of LESSEE  covering  other  aircraft  operated by
LESSEE on which the Engines can be installed.]

         Based upon the  foregoing  and having  regard for legal  considerations
which I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that:



<PAGE>


     1. LESSEE is a corporation duly incorporated,  validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of Indiana.  It has the corporate power and authority to
carry on its  business as  presently  conducted  and to perform its  obligations
under the Lease.

     2.  No  authorization,   approval,   consent,   license  or  order  of,  or
registration  with,  or the giving of notice to the  Aviation  Authority  or any
other  regulatory  body or authority  is required  for the valid  authorization,
execution, delivery and performance by LESSEE of the Lease.

     3. The Lease and the Estoppel  and  Acceptance  Certificate  have each been
duly  authorized,  executed and delivered by LESSEE.  Each such  instrument is a
valid, enforceable and binding obligation of LESSEE except as enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or other Laws of general
application affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights.

     4. The execution and delivery of the Lease and the Estoppel and  Acceptance
Certificate, the consummation by LESSEE of the transactions contemplated therein
and compliance by LESSEE with the terms and provisions thereof do not contravene
any Law  applicable  to  LESSEE,  or result in any breach of or  constitute  any
default under or result in the creation of any lien,  charge or encumbrance upon
any property of LESSEE, under any indenture, mortgage, chattel mortgage, deed of
trust,  conditional  sales contract,  bank loan or credit  agreement,  corporate
charter,  by-law or other  agreement or instrument to which LESSEE is a party or
by which LESSEE or its properties or assets is bound.

     5. Except for any filing or recording  that may be required  with the [NAME
OF  AIRCRAFT   REGISTER]  and  except  for  [DESCRIBE   SUCH  OTHER  FILINGS  OR
RECORDINGS], no filing or recording of any instrument or document (including the
filing of any financial  statement)  is necessary  under the laws of the U.S. in
order for the Lease to constitute a valid and perfected lease of record relating
to the Aircraft,  it being understood that such counsel  expresses no opinion as
to the nature of LESSOR's title to the Aircraft on the Delivery Date.

     6. LESSEE holds all  licenses,  certificates  and permits  from  applicable
governmental  authorities in the U.S.  necessary for the conduct of its business
as a  certificated  air carrier and  performance  of its  obligations  under the
Lease.

     7. To my knowledge, there are no suits or proceedings pending or threatened
against  LESSEE before any Government  Entity against or affecting  LESSEE which
are reasonably likely to be adversely  determined and, if adversely  determined,
would have a material  adverse effect on the financial  condition or business of
LESSEE or its ability to perform  under the Lease,  except as  described  in the
filings provided to LESSOR pursuant to Article 22.


<PAGE>


     8. The  obligations  of LESSEE  under the Lease  are  direct,  general  and
unconditional  obligations  of LESSEE  and rank or will rank at least PARI PASSU
with all other  present  and future  unsecured  and  unsubordinated  obligations
(including  contingent  obligations)  of  LESSEE,  with  the  exception  of such
obligations as are mandatorily preferred by law.

     9.  LESSEE,  under  the  laws  of the  U.S.  or of any  other  jurisdiction
affecting LESSEE, is subject to private  commercial law and suit. Neither LESSEE
nor its  properties  or assets have the right of immunity from suit or execution
on the grounds of  sovereignty  in such  jurisdictions  and the  performance  by
LESSEE of its obligations  under the Lease  constitute  commercial acts done for
commercial purposes.

     10.  There is no  applicable  usury or interest  limitation  Law in Indiana
which may restrict the recovery of payments in accordance with the Lease.

     11.  LESSOR will not violate any Law or become liable to any tax in Indiana
or the U.S. by reason of entering into or performing its  obligations  under the
Lease and it is not  necessary  to  establish  a place of business in Indiana in
order to enforce any provisions of the Lease.

                                                Very truly yours,
