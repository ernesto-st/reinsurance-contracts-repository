</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT, dated as of February&nbsp;25, 2010, is by and
between The Chubb Corporation (the &#147;<U>Corporation</U>&#148;) and &#091;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&#093; (the
&#147;<U>Participant</U>&#148;), pursuant to The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (2009) (the
&#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the same meanings given
to such terms in the Plan. If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with any provision of the
Plan (as either may be interpreted from time to time by the Committee), the Plan shall control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS, </B>pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee has authorized the grant to the
Participant of Non-statutory Stock Options in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, subject to the acceptance of its terms by the Participant; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS, </B>the Participant and the Corporation desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence
and confirm the grant of such Non-statutory Stock Options on the terms and conditions set forth
herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW THEREFORE, </B>the Participant and the Corporation agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Grant of Options; Exercise Price</U>. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, on the
date set forth above (the &#147;<U>Grant Date</U>&#148;), the Corporation has granted and hereby evidences
the grant to the Participant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan,
of options to purchase from the Corporation &#091;<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U>&#093; shares of Stock (the &#147;<U>Option</U>&#148;). The
exercise price for each share of Stock covered by the Option shall be equal to $&#091;US &#95;&#95;&#95;.&#95;&#95;&#95;&#093;, which
was the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date. Upon any exercise of the Options, the
Corporation shall cause a book entry account maintained for the Participant to be credited for the
number of shares of Stock to be issued to the Participant (or shall evidence the issuance of Stock
by such other reasonable method as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once vested in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, Options may be exercised at
any time, and from time to time, prior to the date such Options terminate as determined under
Section 3(a) or 5. Options may only be exercised with respect to full shares of Stock and no
fractional shares of Stock shall be issued. Any exercise of the Option shall be made by giving the
Corporation or its designee written notice of exercise specifying the number of shares of Stock to
be purchased. The notice of exercise shall be accompanied by tender to the Corporation of the full
purchase price of said shares and any Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section&nbsp;11 below). Payment
of the purchase price of the shares of Stock shall be made in cash, check, in a combination of the
foregoing, or by any other method or procedure as shall be permitted by the Plan or the Committee;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, prohibit or
limit the use of shares of Stock as part or full payment of the purchase price and any Tax-Related
Items.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Conditions Applicable to Options</U>. It is understood and agreed that the Option is
subject to the following conditions:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Normal Termination of Options</U>. The Options shall not in any event be
exercisable on or after and shall be forfeited as of the tenth anniversary of the Grant
Date.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Restrictions on Transfer</U>. The Options may not be sold, assigned,
hypothecated, pledged or otherwise transferred or encumbered in any manner except by will or
the laws of descent and distribution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>No Rights as a Shareholder</U>. Neither the Participant nor any legal
representative, legatee, or distributee shall be deemed to be a holder of or possess any
shareholder rights with respect to any shares of Stock subject to the Option prior to the
issuance of such shares upon exercise of the Option.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U>Adjustment in Capitalization</U>. In the event that the Committee shall determine that
any stock dividend, stock split, share combination, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of shares,
warrants or rights offering to purchase Stock at a price substantially below Fair Market Value, or
other similar corporate event affects the Stock such that an adjustment is required in order to
preserve, or to prevent the enlargement of, the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made
available under this Award, then the Committee shall, in such manner as the Committee may deem
equitable (in its sole discretion), adjust any or all of the number and kind of shares subject to
this Option, the exercise price with respect to shares of Stock covered by the Option and/or, if
deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the person holding this Option;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the number of shares subject to this Option always shall be
a whole number.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Termination of Employment</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Qualifying Termination</U>. If the Participant&#146;s employment terminates by reason of a
Qualifying Termination on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, <U>all of the Options
granted hereunder shall become vested and</U> the Participant may exercise the Options until the
normal termination date specified in Section&nbsp;3(a).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Termination for any Other Reason</U>. If the Participant&#146;s employment terminates for
any reason other than a Qualifying Termination on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date,
any Options not exercised on or prior to the date of termination (including, without limitation,
any portion of the Options that are not then exercisable) shall be forfeited and canceled without
further action by the Corporation or the Participant as of the date of such termination. For
purposes of the Option, the term &#147;Retirement&#148; shall mean a termination of the Participant&#146;s
employment other than for Cause at or after the age at which retirement benefits can commence under
the Employer&#146;s retirement plan, or, in the absence of such a plan, on or after the age for
commencement of pension benefits under local statute. Accordingly, all of the Options covered by
the Award shall be forfeited and canceled without further action by the Corporation or the
Participant as of the date a Participant is terminated for Cause, whether prior to, on, or after
the attainment of such age.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Transfers between the Corporation and Subsidiaries; Leaves, Other Absences and
Suspension</U>. Transfer from the Corporation to a Subsidiary, from a Subsidiary to the
Corporation, or from one Subsidiary to another shall not be considered a termination of employment.
Any question regarding whether a Participant&#146;s employment has terminated in connection with a
leave of absence or other absence from active employment shall be determined by the Committee, in
its sole discretion, taking into account the provisions of applicable law and the Corporation&#146;s
generally applicable employment policies and practices. The Committee also may suspend the
operation of the termination of employment provisions of this Agreement for such period and upon
such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary or appropriate to further the interests of the
Corporation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U>Change in Control</U>. Notwithstanding anything in Section&nbsp;2 to the contrary, Section
9 of the Plan shall apply in the event of a Change in Control.

the Participant agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof and of the Plan, including
the following restrictive covenants:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Non-Disclosure</U>. The Participant shall not, without prior written authorization
from the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, disclose to anyone outside the Corporation, or use
(other than in the Corporation&#146;s or any of the Subsidiaries&#146; business), any confidential
information or material relating to the business of the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries that
is acquired by the Participant either during or after employment with the Corporation or any of the
Subsidiaries.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Non-Solicitation</U>. Unless the Participant has received prior written authorization
from the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, the Participant shall not during his or her
employment or service with the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries and for a period of one (1)
year following any termination of such employment or service relationship (the &#147;Restricted
Period&#148;):

provisions of this Section&nbsp;7 at any point before delivery of shares of Stock in respect of the

which any breach by the Participant of any of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7 shall have first

any), as applicable, determined up to the date payment is made), and the Participant shall promptly
repay, to the Corporation the value of any cash or property (including the Fair Market Value of any
Stock) conveyed to the Participant within such period in respect of the Option. Additionally, the

the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the
Participant&#146;s responsibility and that the Corporation and/or the Employer (i)&nbsp;make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with
any aspect of the Award, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent
sale of any shares of Stock acquired upon exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii)&nbsp;do
not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the relevant taxable event, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements
satisfactory to the Corporation and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this
regard, the Participant authorizes the Corporation and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable
Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant from any wages or other cash compensation paid
to the Participant by the Corporation and/or the Employer. Alternatively, or in addition, if
permissible under local law, the Participant authorizes the Corporation and/or the Employer, at
their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as the Corporation may specify from time to time,
to satisfy the obligations with respect to all Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant
by one or a combination of the following: (i)&nbsp;withholding otherwise deliverable shares of Stock,
provided that the Corporation only withholds the amount of shares of Stock necessary to satisfy the
minimum withholding amount or such other amount as may be necessary to avoid adverse accounting
treatment; (ii)&nbsp;arranging for the sale of shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant
(on the Participant&#146;s behalf and at the Participant&#146;s direction pursuant to this authorization); or
(iii)&nbsp;withholding from the proceeds of the sale of shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of the
Option. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of
Stock as described herein, the Participant shall be deemed, for tax purposes only, to have been
issued the full number of shares of Stock subject to the portion of the Option exercised,
notwithstanding that a number of shares are held back solely for purposes of paying the Tax-Related
Items due as a result of any aspect of the Award. The Participant shall pay to the Corporation
and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Corporation and/or the Employer may be
required to withhold as a result of the Participant&#146;s participation in the Plan that cannot be
satisfied by the means previously described. The Corporation may refuse to deliver to the
Participant any shares of Stock pursuant to the Award if the Participant fails to comply with his
or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section&nbsp;11.

kind for services of any kind rendered to the Corporation or any Subsidiary and which is
outside the scope of the Participant&#146;s employment or service contract, if any;

purposes, including, but not limited to, calculation of any severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or
retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as
compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Corporation or any
Subsidiary;

shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option resulting from termination of the
Participant&#146;s employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary (for any reason whatsoever
and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and the Participant irrevocably releases
the Corporation and any Subsidiary from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding
the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen,
then, by signing the Agreement, the Participant shall be deemed to have waived his or her
entitlement to pursue such claim;

Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Participant
is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under
local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of &#147;garden leave&#148; or similar
period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of termination of employment
(whether or not in breach of local labor laws), the Participant&#146;s right to exercise the
Option after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination
of the Participant&#146;s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period
mandated under local law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine
when the Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Option;
