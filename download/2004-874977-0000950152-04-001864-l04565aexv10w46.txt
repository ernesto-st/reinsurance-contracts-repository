AMOUNT OF LIMIT AND RETENTION:
------------------------------

         No claim shall be made hereunder unless and until the Company, on a
         pooled basis where applicable, shall have first sustained an Ultimate
         Net Loss (as defined below) in excess of $120,000,000, regardless of
         the number of Policies under which such loss is payable or the number
         of interests insured. The Reinsurer shall then be liable for the amount
         of Ultimate Net Loss for the Company in excess of $120,000,000 per
         occurrence, but the sum recoverable from the Reinsurer in respect of
         each such loss occurrence shall not exceed the Cat Cover Cap (as
         defined below), nor more than the Cat Cover Cap, in respect of all loss
         occurrences during the term of this contract. The Cat Cover Cap is such
         amount as is available to the Reinsurer from State Auto Financial
         Corporation ("STFC"), the Reinsurer's immediate parent, following
         STFC's sale of its class A Preferred Stock to SAF Funding Corporation
         ("SAF"), an independent special purpose Delaware corporation, pursuant
         to the terms of a Standby Purchase Agreement between STFC and SAF dated
         November 16, 2001 and any amendments thereto or replacements thereof,
         which is part of a structured contingent financing arrangement effected
         through: x) the then current Credit Agreement between SAF and one or
         more financial institutions (the "Lenders"); y) the aforesaid Standby
         Purchase Agreement; and z) the then current Put Agreement among STFC,
         State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company, and the Lenders (it being
         understood and agreed that as of the date hereof the Cat Cover Cap
         shall not exceed $100,000,000).

         The applicability of coverage under this contract is subject to at
         least two risks being involved in the same loss occurrence.


                                   ARTICLE VI
                                   ----------

ULTIMATE NET LOSS:
------------------

         The term "ultimate net loss" shall mean the amount that the Company
         pays as insured losses. Ultimate net loss also includes, but is not
         limited to, all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the
         settlement of losses or resistance to or negotiations concerning a
         loss, including salaries and expenses of employees of the Company while
         diverted from their normal duties to the service of field adjustment
         but shall not include any office expenses of the Company. However,
         nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent the Company from
         including all such amounts defined as ultimate net loss attributable to
         the Group (as defined below), on a pooled basis where applicable, for
         the first $120,000,000 of ultimate net loss. The Group shall mean,
         collectively, the Company and State Auto Property and Casualty

         recovered or received prior or subsequent to loss settlement under this
         Contract, including amounts recoverable under other reinsurance,
         whether collected or not, shall be applied as if recovered or received
         prior to the aforesaid settlement and shall be deducted from the actual

                                   ARTICLE IX

DEFINITION OF LOSS OCCURRENCE:
------------------------------

         The term "loss occurrence" shall mean the sum of all individual losses
         directly occasioned by any one disaster, accident or loss or series of
         disasters, accidents or losses arising out of one event which occurs
         within the area of one state of the United States or province of Canada
         and states or provinces contiguous thereto and to one another. However,
         the duration and extent of any one "loss occurrence" shall be limited
         to all individual losses sustained by the Company occurring during any
         period of one hundred sixty-eight (168) consecutive hours arising out
         of and directly occasioned by the same event except that the term "loss
         occurrence" shall be further defined as follows:

                  A.       As regards windstorm, hail, tornado, hurricane,
                           cyclone, including ensuing collapse and water damage,
                           all individual losses sustained by the Company
                           occurring during any period of seventy-two (72)
                           consecutive hours arising out of and directly
                           occasioned by the same event. However, the event need
                           not be limited to one state or province or states or
                           provinces contiguous thereto.

                  B.       As regards riot, riot attending a strike, civil
                           commotion, vandalism and malicious mischief, all
                           individual losses sustained by the Company occurring
                           during any period of seventy-two (72) consecutive
                           hours within the area of one municipality or county
                           and the municipalities or counties contiguous thereto
                           arising out of and directly occasioned by the same
                           event. The maximum duration of seventy-two (72)
                           consecutive hours may be extended in respect of
                           individual losses which occur beyond such seventy-two
                           (72) consecutive hours during the continued
                           occupation of an insured's premises by strikers,
                           provided such occupation commenced during the
                           aforesaid period.

                  C.       As regards earthquake (the epicentre of which need
                           not necessarily be within the territorial confines
                           referred to in the opening paragraph of this Article)
                           and fire following directly occasioned by the
                           earthquake, only those individual fire losses which
                           commence during the period of one hundred and
                           sixty-eight (168) consecutive hours may be included
                           in the Company's "loss occurrence."

                  D.       As regards "freeze", only individual losses directly
                           occasioned by collapse, breakage of glass and water
                           damage (caused by bursting of frozen pipes and tanks)
                           may be included in the Company's "loss occurrence."

                  For all "loss occurrences" except as referred to under
                  sub-paragraph B, the Company may choose the date and time when
                  any such period of consecutive hours commences, provided that
                  it is not earlier than the date and time of the occurrence of
                  the first recorded individual loss sustained by the Company
                  arising out of that disaster, accident, or loss and provided
                  that only one such period of one hundred and sixty-eight (168)
                  consecutive hours shall apply with respect to one event,
                  except for those "loss occurrences" referred to in
                  sub-paragraph A above, where only one such period of
                  seventy-two (72) consecutive hours shall apply with respect to
                  one event, regardless of the duration of the event.

                  As respect those "loss occurrences" referred to in
                  sub-paragraph B above, if the disaster, accident or loss
                  occasioned by the event is of greater duration than
                  seventy-two (72) consecutive hours, then the Company may
                  divide that disaster, accident or loss into two or more "loss
                  occurrences" provided no two periods overlap and no individual
                  loss is included in more than one such period and provided
                  that no period commences earlier than the date and time of the
                  occurrence of the first recorded individual loss sustained by
                  the Company arising out of that disaster, accident or loss.

                  No individual losses occasioned by an event that would be
                  covered by seventy-two (72) hours clauses may be included in
                  any "loss occurrence" claimed under the one hundred and
                  sixty-eight (168) hours provision.

         subsequent developments pertaining thereto, which may, in the Company's
         opinion, develop into losses involving Reinsurance hereunder.
         Inadvertent omission or oversight in dispatching such advices shall in
         no way affect the liability of the Reinsurer under this Contract
         provided the Company informs the Reinsurer of such omission or
         oversight promptly upon its discovery.

         The Reinsurer shall tender all loss payments as soon as practicable

INSOLVENCY:
-----------

         The reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable by the Reinsurer
         on the basis of the liability of one or more of the Companies under the
         Policy or Policies reinsured without diminution because of the
         insolvency of one or more of the Companies reinsured or because the
         liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the
         Company(ies) has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim.

         In the event of the insolvency of one or more of the Companies
         reinsured, the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor
         of the Company(ies) shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the
         pendency of a claim against the insolvent Company(ies) on the Policy or
         Policies reinsured within a reasonable time after such claim is filed
         in the insolvency proceeding and during the pendency of such claim the
         Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense,
         in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated any defense or
         defenses which it may deem available to the Company(ies) or its
         liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense
         thus incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable subject to court
         approval against the insolvent Company(ies) as part of the expense of
         liquidation to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit which
         may accrue to the Company(ies) solely as a result of the defense
         undertaken by the Reinsurer.

         Where two or more Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a
         majority in interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the
         expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of this
         Contract as though such expense had been incurred by the Company(ies).

         In the event of the insolvency of one or more of the Companies
         reinsured, the reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable by the
         Reinsurer directly to the Company(ies) or to the liquidator, receiver,
         conservator or statutory successor, except as provided by subsection
         (A) of section 4118 of the Insurance Law of New York or except where
         (I) the Contract specifies another payee of such Reinsurance in the
         event of the insolvency of the Company(ies) and (II) the Reinsurer with
         the consent of the direct insureds and, with the prior approval of the
         Superintendent of Insurance of New York to the certificate of
         assumption issued to New York direct insureds, has assumed such policy
         obligations of the Company(ies) as its direct obligations to the payees
         under such policies, in substitution for the obligations of the
         Company(ies) to such payees.

ARBITRATION:
------------

         If any dispute shall arise between the parties to this Contract, either
         before or after its termination, with reference to the interpretation
         of this Contract or the rights of either party with respect to any
         transactions under this Contract, including the formation or validity
         thereof, the dispute shall be referred to three (3) arbitrators as a
         condition precedent to any right of action arising under this Contract.
         The arbitrators shall be active or retired disinterested officers of
         insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's Underwriters other than
         the parties or their affiliates. One arbitrator shall be chosen by each
         party and the third by the two so chosen. If either party refuses or
         neglects to appoint an arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the
         receipt of written notice from the other party requesting it to do so,
         the requesting party may nominate two (2) arbitrators who shall choose
         the third.

         In the event the arbitrators do not agree on the selection of the third
         arbitrator within thirty (30) days after both arbitrators have been
         named, the Company shall petition the American Arbitration Association
         to appoint the third arbitrator. If the American Arbitration
         Association fails to appoint the third arbitrator within thirty (30)
         days after it has been requested to do so, either party may request a
         justice of a court of general jurisdiction of the state in which the
         arbitration is to be held, to appoint an officer or retired officer of
         an insurance or reinsurance company or Lloyd's Underwriter as the third
         arbitrator. In the event both parties request the appointment of the
         third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be the soonest named in
         writing by the justice of the court.

          Each party shall submit its case to the arbitrators within thirty (30)
         days of the appointment of the arbitrators. The arbitrators shall
         consider this Contract an honorable engagement rather than merely a
         legal obligation; they are relieved of all judicial formalities and may
         abstain from following the strict rules of law. The decision of a
         majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding on both the
         Company and the Reinsurer. Judgment may be entered upon the award of
         the arbitrators in any court having jurisdiction.

         Each party shall bear the fee and expenses of its own arbitrator, one
         half of the fee and the expenses of the third arbitrator and one half
         of the other expenses of the arbitration. In the event both arbitrators
         are chosen by one party, the fees of the arbitrators shall be equally
         divided between the parties.

         Any such arbitration shall take place in Columbus, Ohio unless some
         other location is mutually agreed upon by the parties.

                              --------------------


As regards interests which at time of loss or damage are on shore, no liability

standard war or hostilities or warlike operations exclusion clause.

Nevertheless, this Clause shall not be construed to apply to loss or damage
occasioned by riots, strikes, civil commotion, vandalism, and malicious damage.

                  an assessment is made against the Company by the CEA, the
                  Company may include in the Ultimate Net Loss only that
                  assessment directly attributable to each separate loss
                  occurrence covered hereunder. The Company's initial capital

obligations arising from the deferment by the FWUA, FPCJUA and/or RPCJUA of the
collection of monies.

                              REINSURANCE - U.S.A.
                              --------------------

1)   This Agreement does not cover any loss or liability accruing to the
     Reinsured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer,
     from any Pool of Insurers or Reinsurers formed for the purpose of covering
     Atomic or Nuclear Energy risks.

2)   Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph 1) of this
     Clause, this Agreement does not cover any loss or liability accruing to the
     Reinsured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer,
     from any insurance against Physical Damage (including business interruption
     or consequential loss arising out of such Physical Damage) to:

     I.   Nuclear reactor power plants including all auxiliary property on the
          site, or

     II.  Any other nuclear reactor installation, including laboratories
          handling radioactive materials in connection with reactor
          installations, and "critical facilities" as such, or

     III. Installations for fabricating complete fuel elements or for processing
          substantial quantities of "special nuclear material," and for
          reprocessing, salvaging, chemically separating, storing or disposing
          of "spent" nuclear fuel or waste materials, or

     IV.  Installations other than those listed in paragraph 2) III above using
          substantial quantities of radioactive isotopes or other products of
          nuclear fission.

3)   Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs 1) and 2)
     hereof, this Agreement does not cover any loss or liability by radioactive
     contamination accruing to the Reinsured, directly or indirectly, and
     whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, from any insurance on property which is on
     the same site as a nuclear reactor power plant or other nuclear
     installation and which normally would be insured therewith except that this
     paragraph 3) shall not operate:

     a)   where the Reinsured does not have knowledge of such nuclear reactor
          power plant or nuclear installation, or
     b)   where said insurance contains a provision excluding coverage for
          damage to property caused by or resulting from radioactive
          contamination, however caused. However, on and after 1st, January 1960
          this sub-paragraph b) shall only apply provided the said radioactive
          contamination exclusion provision has been approved by the
          Governmental Authority having jurisdiction thereof.

4)   Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs 1), 2) and 3)
     hereof, this Agreement does not cover any loss or liability by radioactive
     contamination accruing to the Reinsured, directly or indirectly, and
     whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, when such radioactive contamination is a
     named hazard specifically insured against.

5)   It is understood and agreed that this Clause shall not extend to risks
     using radioactive isotopes in any form where the nuclear exposure is not
     considered by the Reinsured to be the primary hazard.

6)   The term "special nuclear material" shall have the meaning given it in the
     Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or by any law amendatory thereof.

7)   Reinsured to be sole judge of what constitutes:

     a)   substantial quantities, and

     b)   the extent of installation, plant or site.

NOTE: Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph 1) hereof, it is
understood and agreed that:

     a)   all policies issued by the Reinsured on or before 31st, December 1957,
          shall be free from the application of the other provision of this
          Clause until expiry date or 31st, December 1960, whichever first
          occurs whereupon all the provisions of this Clause shall apply,
     b)   with respect to any risk located in Canada policies issued by the
          Reinsured on or before 31st, December 1958, shall be free from the
          application of the other provisions of this Clause until expiry date
          or 31st, December 1960, whichever first occurs whereupon all the

     this Clause, this Agreement does not cover any loss or liability by
     radioactive contamination accruing to the Reinsured, directly or
     indirectly, and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, from any insurance on
     property which is on the same site as a nuclear reactor power plant or
     other nuclear installation and which normally would be insured therewith,
     except that this paragraph 3) shall not operate:

     (a)  where the Reinsured does not have knowledge of such nuclear reactor
          power plant or nuclear installation, or
     (b)  where said insurance contains a provision excluding coverage for
          damage to property caused by or resulting from radioactive
          contamination, however caused.

4)   Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs 1), 2) and 3)
     of this Clause, this Agreement does not cover any loss or liability by
     radioactive contamination accruing to the Reinsured, directly or
     indirectly, and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, when such radioactive
     contamination is a named hazard specifically insured against.

5)   This Clause shall not extend to risks using radioactive isotopes in any
     form where the nuclear exposure is not considered by the Reinsured to be
     the primary hazard.

6)   The term "radioactive material" means uranium, thorium, plutonium,
     neptunium, their derivatives and compounds, radioactive isotopes of other
     elements and any other substances which may be designated by or pursuant to
     any law, act or statute, or any law amendatory thereof as being prescribed
     substances capable of releasing atomic energy, or as being requisite for
     the production, use or application of atomic energy.

7)   Reinsured to be sole judge of what constitutes:

     a)   substantial quantities, and
     b)   the extent of installation, plant or site.

8)   Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraphs 1), 2), 3) and
     4) of this Clause, this Agreement does not cover any loss or liability
     accruing to the Reinsured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer
     or Reinsurer caused:

     a)   by any nuclear incident as defined by The Nuclear Liability Act or any
          other nuclear liability act, law or statute, or any law amendatory
          thereof or nuclear explosion, except for ensuing loss or damage which
          results directly from fire, lightning or explosion of natural, coal or
          manufactured gas;

     b)   by contamination by radioactive material.

NOTE: Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraphs 1), 2), 3) and
4) of this Clause, paragraph 8) of this Clause shall only apply to all original
contracts of the Reinsured whether new, renewal or replacement which become
effective on or after December 31, 1992.
