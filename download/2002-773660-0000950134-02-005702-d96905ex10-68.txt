                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         This agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of the

a "Shareholder" and collectively, the "Shareholders"), who own all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of SHRG and SAS.

Preliminary Statement

         1. SHRG currently operates the business of providing general agency
services in respect of the STAR Plans (as such term is defined in Subsection
1.05(b) hereof) and SAS currently operates the business of providing third party
administration services in respect of the STAR Plans (collectively, the "STAR
Business").

         2. Each of the Shareholders owns the number of the issued and
outstanding shares (collectively, the "SHRG Shares") of the common stock, no par
value per share (the "SHRG Common Stock"), of SHRG set forth opposite his or her
name on Schedule I attached hereto, which SHRG Shares in the aggregate represent
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of SHRG.

         3. Each of the Shareholders owns the number of the issued and
outstanding shares (collectively, the "SAS Shares") of the common stock, no par
value per share (the "SAS Common Stock"), of SAS set forth opposite his or her
name on Schedule I attached hereto, which SAS Shares in the aggregate represent
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of SAS.

         4. The Buyer desires to purchase, and the Shareholders desire to sell,
all of the SHRG Shares and the SAS Shares (the SHRG Shares and the SAS Shares
are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Shares") for the consideration
set forth below, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         5. Immediately following consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Buyer intends to cause the assets of SHRG and SAS to be contributed to
The MEGA Life and Health Insurance Company, an Oklahoma corporation and a wholly

<PAGE>


1.       Purchase and Sale of the Shares

         1.01 Purchase of the Shares from the Shareholders. Subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing"), each Shareholder shall sell,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept from each Shareholder, all the Shares owned by such
Shareholder, as set forth opposite such Shareholder's name on Schedule I
attached hereto. At the Closing each Shareholder shall deliver to the Buyer
certificates evidencing the Shares owned by such Shareholder duly endorsed in
blank or with stock powers duly executed by such Shareholder.

         1.02 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, at the Buyer's request and without further consideration, each of the
Shareholders shall promptly execute and deliver such instruments of sale,
transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, and take all such other
action as the Buyer may reasonably request, more effectively to transfer, convey
and assign to the Buyer, and to confirm the Buyer's title to, all of the Shares
owned by such Shareholder, to put the Buyer in actual possession and operating
control of the assets, properties and business of the Companies, to assist the
Buyer in exercising all rights with respect thereto and to carry out the purpose
and intent of this Agreement.

         1.03 Purchase Price for the Shares.

                  (a) The purchase price to be paid by the Buyer for the Shares
shall be an amount not to exceed Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) (the
"Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to Subsections 1.03(c), 1.04,
and 1.05 hereof. The Purchase Price shall be payable at Closing (i) in cash to
the extent of $25,000,000, less the amount of any adjustments pursuant to
Subsections 1.03(c), and 1.04 hereof, if any (the "Initial Payment"), which
shall be paid as specified in Subsection 1.03(b), and (ii) by delivery to the
Shareholders of convertible subordinated notes issued by the Buyer substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Notes") representing the
respective contingent interests of the Shareholders in the Earned Premium
Adjustment (as such term is defined in, and as such amount is calculated in
accordance with, Section 1.05 hereof); provided that all such Notes issued at
the Closing shall be held by the Buyer as pledgee pursuant to a pledge agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Pledge Agreement")
until the Settlement Date (as such term is defined in Subsection 1.06 hereof).

                  (b) At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to each of the
Shareholders such Shareholder's pro rata share of the Initial Payment, in the
respective amount set out opposite each such Shareholder's name on Schedule I
hereto, by cashier's or certified check, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as previously designated by the
Shareholders' Representative (as defined in Section 1.07 hereof), or in such
other manner as the parties hereto agree.

                  (c) If the Buyer makes a Pre-Closing Loan (as defined in
Section 6 hereof), the amount of the Initial Payment shall be reduced by the
amount of the Pre-Closing Loan.


                                       2
<PAGE>


                  (d) On the Settlement Date, as provided in Section 1.06
hereof, if the Earned Premium Adjustment is $-0- , the Buyer shall destroy the
Notes issued at the Closing. On the Settlement Date, if the Earned Premium
Adjustment is a positive amount, the Buyer shall at its option either (x) pay an
amount in cash equal to the Earned Premium Adjustment (which shall then
represent the aggregate principal amount of the Notes) together with payment of
all accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes, and thereby fully satisfy and
discharge the Notes, or (y) deliver to each of the Shareholders such
Shareholder's Note, in accordance with Subsection 1.06 of the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the terms of the Notes.

         1.04 Net Worth Adjustment and CNA Adjustment. The Purchase Price set
forth in Subsection 1.03 hereof shall be subject to adjustment, whether on or
after the date of the Closing (the "Closing Date") as follows:

                  (a) The Shareholders have commissioned Gaintner Bandler Reed
PLC, independent public accountants for the Companies (the "Company Auditors"),
to conduct a full audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
of the assets, liabilities, revenues, operations, books and records of each of
the Companies as at and for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Shareholders
have caused the Company Auditors to deliver to the Buyer financial statements
for each of the Companies consisting of a balance sheet as of December 31, 2001
(the "Audited Balance Sheet") and the related statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows of each of the Companies for the fiscal year
then ended, together with the opinion of the Company Auditors to the effect that
such financial statements fairly present the financial condition of each of the
Companies as of the respective dates indicated therein and results of operations
of each of the Companies for the respective periods indicated therein, and that
such financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Practices ("GAAP"), applied consistently with past practices
(the "Audited Financial Statements"). The Buyer and its designated firm of
independent certified accountants shall have the right to review the work papers
of the Company Auditors utilized in preparing the Audited Financial Statements,
and shall have full access to the books, records, properties and personnel of
the Companies subsequent to the Closing Date for purposes of verifying the
accuracy and fairness of the presentation of the Audited Financial Statements.

                  (b) Attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C is an estimated
pro forma balance sheet of each of the Companies as of the Closing Date (the
"Pro Forma Closing Date Balance Sheets"), which represent the parties' best
estimate of the assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity of each of the
Companies as of the Closing Date. The Pro Forma Closing Date Balance Sheets
reflect a combined net worth of the Companies in the amount of $2,011,230
assuming for purposes of the calculation thereof that the amount of the
Pre-Closing Loan is classified as equity rather than indebtedness of SHRG.

                  (c) Promptly following the Closing (but in no event later than
20 business days thereafter), the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the
Shareholders' Representative balance sheets of each of the Companies as of the
Closing Date (the "Actual Closing Date Balance Sheets") and the related
statement of income for each of the Companies for the portion of the year then
ended (the "Closing Period Income Statements"). Such Actual Closing Date Balance
Sheets and Closing Period Income Statements will fairly and accurately present
the financial


                                       3
<PAGE>


condition of each of the Companies as of the Closing Date and results of
operations of each of the Companies for the period then ended, and will be
prepared by the Buyer in accordance with GAAP, subject to normal and recurring
audit adjustments. The Shareholders' Representative and its designated firm of
independent certified accountants shall have the right to review the work papers
of the Buyer utilized in preparing the Actual Closing Date Balance Sheets and
the Closing Date Income Statements, and shall have full access to the books,
records, properties and personnel of the Companies after the Closing Date for
purposes of verifying the accuracy and fairness of the presentation of the
Actual Closing Date Balance Sheets and the Closing Period Income Statements. In
the event that the Shareholders' Representative disagrees with the Closing Date
Combined Net Worth (as defined in Subsection 1.04(d)), the Shareholders'
Representative shall, within 15 days after delivery of the Actual Closing Date
Balance Sheets and Closing Period Income Statements, deliver to the Buyer a
Dispute Notice in accordance with Subsection 1.05(d) hereof.

                  (d) If the combined net worth of the Companies as reflected in
the Actual Closing Date Balance Sheets plus the dollar amount of the Pre-Closing
Loan (the "Closing Date Combined Net Worth") is less than the combined net worth
of the Companies as reflected in the Pro Forma Closing Date Balance Sheets, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount, if any (the "Net Worth
Adjustment"), equal to the difference; provided, however, that no adjustment to
the Purchase Price shall be made if the amount of the difference is less than
$100,000. Any such Net Worth Adjustment shall first be paid in accordance with
Subsection 1.06(a) hereof and any additional shortfall shall be reimbursed by
the Shareholders Pro Rata to the Buyer within 10 days after the Buyer's written
demand. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Pro Rata" shall mean with
respect to a Shareholder the respective percentage set forth opposite such
Shareholder's name under the column "% of SHRG Proceeds" on Schedule I hereto.

                  (e) The Shareholders have informed the Buyer that pursuant to
the termination effective March 1, 2002 of SHRG's and SAS's existing agreements
with CNA Financial Corporation or a subsidiary thereof ("CNA"), CNA will at some
time subsequent to the Closing Date conduct an audit of amounts due and owing as
between SHRG, SAS and CNA (the "CNA Audit"). The parties hereto agree that the
Closing Date Balance Sheet should accurately reflect such amounts as may be due
and owing to or from CNA, as the case may be. Accordingly, in the event that the
results of the CNA Audit would, if known prior to the date of delivery of the
Actual Closing Date Balance Sheets, have resulted in a change to the Actual
Closing Date Balance Sheets, the dollar amount of the positive or negative
effect on the combined Closing Date Net Worth of the Companies due to such
change will be applied either (i) to increase the Purchase Price (if the results
of the CNA Audit would have increased the combined Closing Date Net Worth of the
Companies) with such amount payable in cash by Buyer to each Shareholder for his
or her Pro Rata share of such increase or (ii) to decrease the Purchase Price
(if the results of the CNA Audit would have decreased the combined Closing Date
Net Worth of the Companies) with such decrease to be paid in accordance with
Section 1.06(a) hereof and any additional shortfall shall be reimbursed by the
Shareholders pro rata to the Buyer within 10 days after the Buyer's written
demand (it being agreed and understood that the adjustment to the Purchase Price
to be made hereunder, if any, shall not be subject to the


                                       4

$100,000 limitation set forth in Section 1.04(d) or any limitation set forth in
Section 9.08 hereof).

         1.05 Earned Premium Adjustment.

                  (a) In addition to the Initial Payment as described in
Subsection 1.03(b) and as adjusted in accordance with Subsection 1.04, the
Purchase Price shall consist of the Earned Premium Adjustment, if any, which
shall be in an amount ranging from $-0- to a maximum of $15,000,000, as
calculated in the manner hereinafter described. If prior to May 31, 2003 UICI or
MEGA shall sell, dispose or otherwise transfer to an unaffiliated third party
all or substantially all of the assets comprising the STAR Business (a "Sale
Transaction"), other than pursuant to a Merger Event (as such term is defined
below), then in such event, upon the consummation of the Sale Transaction, the
Earned Premium Adjustment shall be deemed to equal $15,000,000, and no
calculation of Annualized Premium shall be required. The Buyer will notify the
Shareholders' Representative promptly following the occurrence of a Sale
Transaction prior to May 31, 2003.

                  (b) Unless a Sale Transaction has occurred prior to May 31,
2003, the Earned Premium Adjustment will be calculated based on the amount of
the Annualized Earned Premium (as defined below) as shown on the books of MEGA
in respect of the STAR Plans (as defined below) plus the Third Party Earned
Premiums (as defined below), in each case for the applicable Measurement Period
(as defined below). For purposes of this Subsection 1.05, the following
capitalized terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:

                  "Annualized Earned Premium" shall mean an amount equal to the
net earned premiums attributable to the STAR Plans plus the Third Party Earned
Premiums during the Measurement Period, all calculated in accordance with
Historical GAAP and annualized on the basis of a 12-month/365 day year.

                  "Downgrade Event" shall mean the assignment by A.M. Best & Co.
to MEGA on or prior to April 15, 2003 of a rating lower than "A- (Excellent),"
provided that such downgrading is not due in whole or in part to the negative
performance of the STAR Business.

                  "Historical GAAP" with respect to calculation of Annualized
Earned Premium shall mean GAAP as applied consistent with the past practices of
SHRG to the calculation of net earned premiums attributable to the STAR Plans,
as such GAAP is in effect on the Closing Date, regardless of any changes or
additions to GAAP that may occur after the Closing Date.

                  "Measurement Period" shall mean the three-month period
commencing March 1, 2003 to and inclusive of May 31, 2003; provided, however,
that if a Downgrade Event, a Merger Event, or a Termination Event occurs on or
before April 15, 2003, at the option of the Shareholders exercised by written
notice from the Shareholders' Representative to the Buyer within 30 days
following the first such event to occur, "Measurement Period" shall mean the two
full calendar months immediately preceding the month in which such Downgrade
Event, Merger Event or Termination Event occurs.

                  "Merger Event" shall mean the occurrence (on or prior to April
15, 2003) of (a) sale by UICI of substantially all of its assets or (b) merger
or consolidation by UICI with another


                                       5
<PAGE>


corporation, with such other corporation being the survivor in the merger or
consolidation, and in each case either (x) if the transferee of such assets or
the survivor in such merger or consolidation is not a regulated insurance
company, such transferee or survivor shall have been assigned a corporate debt
rating of less than "BBB" by Moody's or Standard & Poor's, or (y) if the
transferee of such assets or the survivor in such merger or consolidation is a
regulated insurance company, such transferee or survivor shall have been
assigned a rating lower than "A- (Excellent)" by A.M. Best & Co.

                  "STAR Plans" means certain programs and policies of sickness
and accident insurance known as (i) STARBRIDGE Sickness and Accident Plan, (ii)
Fundamental Care, (iii) Fundamental Care Plus, (iv) ProDrivers Choice, (v)
STARAssist, and (vi) HealthBasic Sickness and Accident Plan.

                  "Termination Event" shall mean either (i) termination by MEGA
on or prior to April 15, 2003 of the employment of Tim Cook without cause, or
(ii) voluntary discontinuance by MEGA on or prior to April 15, 2003 of the STAR
Business other than due to a Sale Transaction.

                  "Third Party Earned Premiums" shall mean the net earned
premium written during the Measurement Period by Guarantee Trust Life Insurance
Company ("GTL") or by any other underwriter that writes policies in respect of
the STAR Plans during Measurement Period.

                  (c) If and to the extent the Annualized Earned Premium is
greater than $70,000,000, then in such event the Earned Premium Adjustment will
be an amount equal to 75% of the difference between (x) the Annualized Earned
Premium and (y) $70,000,000; provided however, that the Earned Premium
Adjustment shall not in any event exceed $15,000,000. If and to the extent that
the Annualized Earned Premium is equal to or less than $70,000,000, then in such
event the Earned Premium Adjustment shall be $-0-. For example, (i) if the
Annualized Earned Premium is $80,000,000, then the Earned Premium Adjustment
will be $7,500,000; (ii) if the Annualized Earned Premium is greater than
$90,000,000, then the Earned Premium Adjustment will in all cases be
$15,000,000; and (iii) if the Annualized Earned Premium is $70,000,000 or less,
the Earned Premium Adjustment in all cases will be $-0-.

                  (d) Unless a Sale Transaction has occurred prior to May 31,
2003, within 15 calendar days after October 1, 2003, the Buyer will send to the
Shareholders' Representative the Buyer's good faith calculation of the amount of
Annualized Earned Premium and Earned Premium Adjustment as calculated pursuant
to this Subsection 1.05. The amount of the Annualized Earned Premium and the
Earned Premium Adjustment, as determined by the Buyer in accordance with the
preceding paragraphs (a) and (c), shall be final and binding upon the
Shareholders and the Shareholders' Representative, unless the Shareholders'
Representative gives written notice within fifteen 15 calendar days after
receipt of the Buyer's calculation of the Annualized Earned Premium and the
Earned Premium Adjustment, which written notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature and extent of such disagreement (the "Dispute Notice"). In the
event of any dispute between the parties with respect to the Annualized Earned
Premium or the Earned Premium Adjustment, the parties shall first use their best
efforts to resolve such dispute among themselves. If the parties are unable to
resolve the dispute within thirty 30


                                       6
<PAGE>


calendar days after the date of the Dispute Notice, the dispute will be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the following provisions of this
Subsection 1.05. The Buyer and the Shareholders may extend the Shareholders'
review period by mutual written agreement.

                           (i) The Shareholders' Representative will designate a
firm of independent certified accountants to represent all of the Shareholders
in the arbitration process, and all of the Shareholders shall be bound by and
comply with the decisions, actions and agreements made by such accountants. The
Shareholders' Representative and its designated firm of independent certified
accountants shall have the right to review the work papers of the Buyer utilized
in preparing the calculation of Annualized Earned Premium and the Earned Premium
Adjustment, and shall have reasonable access to the books and records of the
Companies following the date the Buyer submits the Annualized Earned Premium and
the Earned Premium Adjustment to the Shareholders for purposes of verifying the
accuracy of the calculation of the Annualized Earned Premium and the Earned
Premium Adjustment.

                           (ii) Within 10 calendar days after the end of the
30-day period following receipt of the Dispute Notice during which the parties
shall have attempted to resolve the dispute among themselves, the Buyer and the
Shareholders' Representative shall designate in writing one arbitrator who is
experienced in insurance, accounting and finance matters (the "arbitrator") to
resolve the dispute; provided, that if the parties hereto cannot agree on an
arbitrator within such 10-day period, the arbitrator shall be selected by the
American Arbitration Association in Dallas, Texas. Failure by either the Buyer
or the Shareholders' Representative to notify the other party of its selection
and approval of the arbitrator and to consummate the selection process set forth
in this subparagraph (ii) within the allotted time periods shall foreclose such
failing party from the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator so designated
shall not be an employee, consultant, officer, director or shareholder of any
party hereto or any Affiliate of any party to this Agreement.

                           (iii) Within 15 days after the selection of the
arbitrator, the arbitrator, the Buyer and the Shareholders' Representative shall
meet, at which time the Buyer and the Shareholders' Representative shall be
required to set forth in writing their respective proposals and issues related
to the amount of Annualized Earned Premium and Earned Premium Adjustment, with
accompanying work papers and accounting support.

                           (iv) The arbitrator shall set a date for a hearing,
which shall be no later than 30 days after the submission of written proposals
pursuant to subparagraph (d)(iii) above, to discuss each of the issues
identified by the Buyer and the Shareholders' Representative. The arbitration
shall be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association;
provided, that the arbitrator shall have sole discretion with regard to the
admissibility of evidence.

                           (v) The arbitrator shall, within thirty (30) days
after receiving the positions of both the Shareholders' Representative and Buyer
and all supplementary supporting documentation requested by the arbitrator,
render its decision as to the calculation of the Annualized Earned Premium and
the Earned Premium Adjustment, which decision shall be (x) set forth in writing,
(y) limited to endorsing either Buyer's or the Shareholders' Representative's
position as most accurate in light of the facts presented, and (z) final and


                                       7
<PAGE>


binding on, and nonappealable by, the Shareholders and the Buyer. The arbitrator
may conduct an audit of any information or documentation if such audit will
facilitate a decision. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of any audit
requested by the arbitrator shall be paid entirely by the party whose position
was not endorsed.

                           (vi) The Shareholders shall be responsible for paying
all fees, costs and disbursements of both the Shareholders' Representative and
for any accountant selected by the Shareholders' Representative to assist them
in any discussions or in the arbitration.

                           (vii) Any arbitration pursuant to this Subsection
1.05 shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas. Any arbitration award may be entered
in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereover and the parties
hereby consent and commit themselves to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Texas for purposes of the enforcement of any arbitration decision.

         1.06 Payment of Earned Premium Adjustment.

                  (a) On the tenth business day following the final
determination of the Earned Premium Adjustment, if any (the "Settlement Date"),
the Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders such Earned Premium Adjustment, if any.
If the amount of the Earned Premium Adjustment is $-0-, the Notes issued by the
Buyer at the Closing and held by the Buyer in accordance with Subsection 1.03(a)
of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement shall be destroyed by the Buyer and
no amount shall be paid to any of the Shareholders in respect thereof. If the
amount of the Earned Premium Adjustment is a positive amount after all
adjustments pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall at its option either (x)
pay an amount in cash equal to the Earned Premium Adjustment (which shall then
represent the aggregate principal amount of the Notes), together with payment of
all accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes, and thereby fully satisfy and
discharge the Notes, or (y) deliver to each of the Shareholders such
Shareholder's Note, in accordance with Subsection 1.06 of the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the terms of the Notes. In either case the Shareholders shall be
required to surrender the Notes issued at the Closing for such cash payment or
Notes, as the case may be. Because such Notes will initially be held by the
Buyer as pledgee pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, each of the Shareholders
hereby irrevocably appoints the Buyer as its agent to surrender such Notes in
exchange for such cash payment or issuance of replacement Notes, and to deliver
such cash or replacement Notes, as applicable, to the Shareholders. The amount
of the Earned Premium Adjustment shall be subject to reduction in the event that
a Net Worth Adjustment is required pursuant to Subsection 1.04(d) or Subsection
9.05 hereof, by reducing the amount of cash otherwise payable pursuant to
Subsection 1.06(b) or by reducing the principal amount of the Notes otherwise
deliverable pursuant to Subsection 1.06(c), as applicable.

                  (b) If the Buyer elects to pay cash as provided above to
satisfy and discharge the Notes issued at Closing, then the amount of the Earned
Premium Adjustment to be paid to each Shareholder shall be such Shareholder's
Pro Rata share, as designated in Schedule I hereto, of the Earned Premium
Adjustment, and such amount shall be paid on the Settlement Date by cashier's or
certified check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts as previously designated by the Shareholders'
Representative. Any such cash payment of Earned Premium Adjustment, if any,
shall include interest on any such amount computed at


                                       8
<PAGE>


the rate of 6% per annum simple interest commencing on the Closing Date and
accruing to and including the Settlement Date, which shall represent payment of
interest on the Notes issued at the Closing.

                  (c) If the Buyer elects to deliver replacement Notes as
provided above, then the Buyer will issue on the Settlement Date to each
Shareholder a Note in replacement of the Note initially issued at the Closing
having a principal amount equal to such Shareholder's Pro Rata share, as
designated in Schedule I hereto, of the Earned Premium Adjustment. Any such
delivery of replacement Notes shall be accompanied by delivery of a cash payment
equal to interest on the Earned Premium Adjustment amount computed at the rate
of 6% per annum simple interest commencing on the Closing Date and accruing to
and including the Settlement Date, which shall represent payment of interest on
the Notes issued at the Closing.

                  (d) The Notes issued at the Closing shall have the terms set
out on Exhibit A hereto. In addition, at the Closing the Shareholders and UICI
will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit D hereto.

                  (e) Commencing two years after the Closing Date, any
Shareholder who holds a Note may request a replacement Note which shall have
identical terms and provisions except for the deletion of Section XII
(Successors and Assigns) and Section XIII (Right of Set-Off) thereof.

         1.07 Shareholders' Representative.

                  (a) In order to efficiently administer matters pertaining to
this Agreement such matters are delegated by the Shareholders to the
Shareholders' Representative (as defined herein), including without limitation
(i) the determination of the Closing Date Combined Net Worth, (ii) the waiver of
any condition to the obligations of the Shareholders to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the defense and/or settlement of any
claims for which the Shareholders may be required to indemnify the Buyer or the
Companies pursuant to Section 9 hereof, and (iv) the review, calculation and
arbitration, if requested, of the amount of the Annualized Earned Premium and
Earned Premium Adjustment, the Shareholders hereby designate Charles A.
Shoumaker as their representative (the "Shareholders' Representative").

                  (b) The Shareholders hereby authorize the Shareholders'
Representative (i) to make all decisions relating to the determination of the
Closing Date Combined Net Worth, the Annualized Earned Premium and the Earned
Premium Adjustment, (ii) to take all action necessary in connection with the
waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Shareholders to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the defense and/or settlement of any claims
for which the Shareholders may be required to indemnify the Buyer or the
Companies pursuant to Section 9 hereof, (iii) to give and receive all notices
required to be given under this Agreement, and (iv) to take any and all
additional action as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the
Shareholders by the terms of this Agreement.

                  (c) In the event that the Shareholders' Representative dies,
becomes unable to perform his responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, Shareholders holding, prior


                                       9
<PAGE>


to the Closing, a majority of the SHRG Shares as set forth on Schedule I
attached hereto shall select another representative to fill such vacancy with
respect to both SHRG and SAS, and such substituted representative shall be
deemed to be the Shareholders' Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement.

                  (d) All decisions and actions by the Shareholders'
Representative, including, without limitation, any agreement between the
Shareholders' Representative and the Buyer relating to the determination of the
Closing Date Combined Net Worth, the Annualized Earned Premium and the Earned
Premium Adjustment, or the defense or settlement of any claims for which the
Shareholders may be required to indemnify the Buyer and/or the Companies
pursuant to Section 9 hereof, shall be binding upon all of the Shareholders, and
no Shareholders shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same.

                  (e) By his or her execution of this Agreement, each
Shareholder agrees that:

                           (i) the Buyer shall be able to rely conclusively on
the instructions and decisions of the Shareholders' Representative as to the
determination of the Closing Date Combined Net Worth, the Annualized Earned
Premium and the Earned Premium Adjustment, or the settlement of any claims for
indemnification by the Buyer or the Companies pursuant to Section 9 hereof or
any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders'
Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder shall have any cause of action
against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of the Shareholders' Representative;

                           (ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the
Shareholders' Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the
Shareholders and no Shareholder shall have any cause of action against the
Shareholders' Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Shareholders' Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud
or willful breach of this Agreement by the Shareholders' Representative;

                           (iii) the provisions of this Subsection 1.07 are
independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and
shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Shareholder
may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

                           (iv) remedies available at law for any breach of the
provisions of this Subsection 1.07 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer and the
Companies shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without
the necessity of proving damages if either the Buyer or either of the Companies
brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Subsection 1.07; and

                           (v) the provisions of this Subsection 1.07 shall be
binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives and successors of each
Shareholder, and any references in this Agreement to a Shareholder or the
Shareholders shall mean and include the successors to the Shareholders' rights
hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and
distribution or otherwise.

their respective business for the periods indicated. With respect to contracts
and commitments for the provision of services by SHRG and SAS, the Financial
Statements contain and reflect adequate reserves, which are consistent with
previous reserves taken, for all reasonably anticipated material losses and
costs and expenses. The amounts shown as accrued for current and deferred income
and other taxes in the Financial Statements are sufficient for the payment of

knowledge of the Shareholders, threatened before any court or governmental
agency, authority, body or arbitrator and, to the knowledge of the Shareholders,
there is no basis for any such action, suit or proceeding; (b) neither SHRG nor

         3.20 Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (a) Employee Plans. Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedule
attached hereto contains a true, correct and complete list of all pension,
benefit, profit sharing, retirement, deferred compensation, welfare, insurance,
disability, bonus, vacation pay, severance pay and other similar plans, programs
and agreements, whether reduced to writing or not, relating to the employees of

businesses under common control, or affiliated service group (as defined for
purposes of Section 414(b), (c) and (m), respectively, of the Code) (the
"Employee Plans") of which SHRG or SAS is or has been a member (as "ERISA
Affiliate"). Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither SHRG nor SAS has obligations, contingent or otherwise, past or present,
under applicable law or the terms of any Employee Plan. None of SHRG, SAS or any

Neither SHRG nor SAS has contributed to, or has any past or present obligation
to contribute to, any stock option or stock purchase plan or other plan designed
to hold the stock of SHRG or SAS or any of their affiliates. None of the
Employee Plans provides for the payment of separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits to any person, or provides for or promises retiree medical
or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or
director of SHRG or SAS, except to the extent required by law.

                  (b) Prohibited Transactions. None of the Shareholders, SHRG,
SAS or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, or any "party
in interest" or "disqualified person," as such terms are defined in Section 3 of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and
Section 4975 of the Code has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or
been a party to any nonexempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined
in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, in connection with which,
directly or indirectly, the Buyer or any of its affiliates, directors or
employees or any Employee Plan or any related funding medium could be subject to
either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed
by Section 4975 of the Code.

                  (c) Compliance. With respect to all Employee Plans, SHRG and
SAS are in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,
orders or governmental rules or regulations currently in effect, including, but
not limited to, ERISA and the Code, applicable to such Employee Plans. SHRG and
SAS have in all respects performed all obligations required to be performed by
them under, and are not in violation in any respect of, and there has been no
default or violation by any other party with respect to, any of the Employee
Plans. Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Employee Plans which are subject to Title IV of ERISA has been or will be
terminated in whole or in part within the meaning of ERISA or the Code; no
liability has been incurred to, nor has any event or circumstance occurred, nor
will any event or circumstance occur prior to the Closing Date, which could
result in such a liability being asserted by, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to any Employee Plan (other than the payment of annual
premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA); nor has any Employee Plan that is subject
to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or both,
incurred any "accumulated


                                       24
<PAGE>


funding deficiency" (as defined in ERISA), whether or not waived; nor has SHRG
or SAS failed to pay any amounts due and owing as required by the terms of any
Employee Plan; nor has there been any "reportable event" within the meaning of
Sections 4043(b)(1)-(9) of ERISA, or any event described in Section 4063(a) of
ERISA, with respect to any Employee Plan, other than as disclosed herein or on
accompanying schedules.

                  (d) Multiemployer Plans. None of SHRG nor SAS or any ERISA
Affiliate has ever been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

                  (e) Copies of Employee Plans and Related Documents. The
Shareholders or SHRG or SAS have previously delivered to the Buyer true, correct
and complete copies of all Employee Plans which have been reduced to writing and
written descriptions of all Employee Plans which have not been reduced to
writing, and all agreements, including trust agreements and insurance contracts,
related to such Employee Plans, and the Summary Plan Description and all
modifications thereto for each Employee Plan communicated to employees. With
respect to each Employee Plan that is an "employee benefit plan," as such term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (the "ERISA Plans"), true, correct and
complete copies of (i) the annual actuarial valuation reports for the last five
years, (ii) the Form 5500 and Schedules filed for the last five years and (iii)
any filings made with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Internal Revenue
Service or Department of Labor, or any correspondence with or from such
agencies, regarding the termination of any such ERISA Plan, have been delivered
to the Buyer.

                  (f) Qualification. Each Employee Plan and all amendments
thereto intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code have been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to so qualify, and the trusts created
thereunder have been determined to be exempt from tax under the provisions of
Section 501(a) of the Code, and copies of all determination letters with respect
to each such Employee Plan have been previously delivered by the Shareholders or
SHRG or SAS to the Buyer, and nothing has since occurred which might cause the
loss of such qualification or exemption, no such Employee Plan has been operated
in a manner which would cause it to be disqualified in operation, and all such
Employee Plans have been administered in all material respects in compliance
with and consistent with all applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA,
including, without limitation, all reporting and disclosure requirements.

                  (g) Funding Status.

                           (i) With respect to each Employee Plan which is a
defined benefit plan, as such term is defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a
"Defined Benefit Plan"), and that is subject to Section 412 of the Code, the
present value of the actuarial accrued liability, determined on a plan
termination basis, does not exceed the fair market value of the assets held
under each such Plan and allocable to the benefits represented by such
liability, and there is no unpaid contribution due with respect to the plan year
of any such Defined Benefit Plan ended prior to the Closing Date, as required
under the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of ERISA. For the purpose
of the preceding sentence, the present value of actuarial accrued liability
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such Defined Benefit
Plan as


                                       25
<PAGE>


are adopted or negotiated on or before the Closing Date and such laws as are
applicable to such Defined Benefit Plan, and the assumptions used shall be
reasonable in the opinion of the Buyer.

                           (ii) All material contributions, premiums or payments
required to be made with respect to any Employee Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for
income tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed,
and, to the knowledge of SHRG, SAS and the Shareholders, no fact or event exists
which could give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

                           (iii) All premiums or other payments required by the
terms of any group or individual insurance policies and programs maintained by
SHRG or SAS and covering any present or former employees of SHRG or SAS with
respect to all periods up to and including the Closing Date have been fully paid
for the length of the obligation.

                  (h) Claims and Litigation. There are no pending or to the
knowledge of the Shareholders, threatened claims, suits or other proceedings by
present or former employees of SHRG or SAS or their affiliates, plan
participants, beneficiaries or spouses of any of the above, including claims
against the assets of any trust, involving any Employee Plan, or any rights or
benefits thereunder, other than ordinary and usual claims for benefits by
participants or beneficiaries, and to the knowledge of SHRG, SAS and the
Shareholders, no fact or event exists that could give rise to any such action,
suit or claim.

                  (i) No Implied Rights. Nothing expressed or implied herein
shall confer upon any past or present employee of SHRG or SAS, their respective
representatives, beneficiaries, successors and assigns, nor upon any collective
bargaining agent, any rights or remedies of any nature, including, without
limitation, any rights to employment or continued employment with the Buyer,
SHRG, SAS, or any successor or affiliate; nor shall the Buyer, SHRG, SAS, or
their affiliates be precluded or prevented from terminating or amending any
Employee Plan.

                  (j) Transfer. SHRG and SAS, as applicable, shall take any
actions as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the
Buyer and the Buyer's counsel under all applicable laws and the terms of the
Employee Plans to establish the Buyer, or an affiliate of the Buyer, as having
all rights and obligations with respect to the Employee Plans assumed pursuant
to this Agreement, including, without limitation, rights with respect to all
annuity or insurance contracts which form a part of any of such Employee Plans,
together with all other Employee Plan assets. The Shareholders shall obtain as
of the Closing Date any and all consents from trustees required to effect any
transfer of any trust(s) related to such assumed Employee Plans to such
Trustee(s) as may be appointed by the Buyer.

                  (k) Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Disclosure
Schedule, there has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
announcement (whether or not written) by SHRG, SAS or any ERISA Affiliate
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Employee
Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee
Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereto for the most
recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

         4.02 Authorization. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Buyer, and the agreements provided for herein, and the consummation by the Buyer
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized
by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement constitutes the valid and

accordance with its terms. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the agreements provided for herein, and the consummation by the

provisions of any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Buyer; (b) violate
the provisions of the Buyer's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (c)
violate any judgment, decree, order or award of any court, governmental body or
arbitrator; or (d) conflict with or result in the breach or termination of any

trust or other agreement or instrument to which the Buyer is a party or by which
the Buyer is or may be bound.

         4.03 Investment Representation. The Buyer is acquiring the Shares from
each Shareholder for its own account for investment and not with a view to, or
for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any present
intention of distributing or selling the same; and, except as contemplated by
this Agreement and the agreements contemplated herein, the Buyer has no present
or contemplated agreement, undertaking, arrangement, obligation, indebtedness or
commitment providing for the disposition thereof.

5.       Access to Information; Public Announcements.

                                       31
<PAGE>


all previous claims of privilege or other restrictions, and in any case where a
release by a present or former employee of SHRG or SAS is necessary, the
Shareholders shall exercise their best efforts to obtain such a release.

         5.02 Public Announcements. The parties agree that any and all general
public announcements or other general public communications concerning this
Agreement and the purchase of the Shares by the Buyer, and the timing, manner
and content of such disclosures, shall be subject to the mutual agreement of the

severally, hereby indemnify and hold the Buyer, SHRG and SAS harmless from and
against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, settlement costs and any legal, accounting or other expenses
for investigating or defending any actions or threatened actions) (collectively,
the "Losses") in connection with each and all of the following:

                  (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Shareholders, SHRG or SAS in this Agreement;

                  (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the
Shareholders, SHRG or SAS contained in this Agreement or any other agreement,
instrument or document contemplated by this Agreement;

                  (c) any misrepresentation contained in any statement,
certificate or schedule furnished by the Shareholders, SHRG or SAS pursuant to
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

                  (d) any violation by SHRG or SAS of, or any failure by SHRG or
SAS to comply with, any law, ruling, order or decree, including any costs
incurred by the Buyer in connection with the transfer of the Shares;

                  (e) any tax liabilities or obligations of SHRG or SAS for all
periods on or prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent reserved for on
the Actual Closing Date Balance Sheets;

                  (f) any cost or liability arising out of either of the
Companies' failure to be qualified to do business or be in good standing in any
jurisdiction in which its ownership of


                                       35
<PAGE>


property or the character of its business requires such qualification (including
any and all costs to obtain such qualification); and

                  (g) any claims against, or liabilities or obligations of, SHRG
or SAS with respect to obligations under Employee Plans not specifically assumed
by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

         9.02 By the Buyer. The Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds the
Shareholders harmless from and against all Losses in connection with each of the
following:

                  (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Buyer in this Agreement; and

                  (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the
Buyer contained in this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document
contemplated by this Agreement.

         9.03 Claims for Indemnification. Whenever any claim shall arise for
indemnification under this Section 9, the party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnified Party"), shall promptly notify the party against whom
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the claim and, when
known, the facts constituting the basis for such claim. In the event of any such
claim for indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any
claim or legal proceedings by a third party, the notice shall specify, if known,
the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any claim by a third party for
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, of the
Indemnifying Party, who, in the case of the Shareholders' Representative, shall
have the power and authority to bind all of the Shareholders; provided, however,
that if suit shall have been instituted against the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall not have taken control of such suit after notification
thereof as provided in Subsection 9.04 of this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to settle or compromise such claim upon giving notice to
the Indemnifying Party as provided in Subsection 9.04. Failure of the
Shareholders' Representative to give notice to any Shareholder shall not relieve
such Shareholder from its obligations hereunder.

         9.04 Defense by the Indemnifying Party. In connection with any claim
which may give rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any
claim or legal proceeding by a person other than the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, may,
upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume the defense of any such
claim or legal proceeding if the Indemnifying Party acknowledges to the
Indemnified Party in writing the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such claim. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such claim or legal
proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claims or legal proceedings
and at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party shall take all steps
necessary in the defense or settlement thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such
claim or legal proceeding,


                                       36
<PAGE>


without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action,
with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom within 30
days after the date such claim is made: (a) the Indemnified Party may defend
against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
including, but not limited to, settling such claim or litigation, after giving
notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified
Party may deem appropriate, and (b) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its counsel
and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question
the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such third party claim or the
amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party
did not defend or settle such third party claim in a reasonably prudent manner.

         9.05 Payment to the Buyer of Indemnification Obligation. Each of the
Shareholders hereby agrees that any claim for indemnification by the Buyer, SHRG
or SAS under this Section 9 or under any other provision of this Agreement, may,
at the option of the Buyer or SHRG or SAS, as the case may be, be offset against
the principal amount of the Note to be delivered pursuant to Subsection 1.06(c)
or the cash amount payable pursuant to Subsection 1.06(b), as applicable. All
indemnification by the Shareholders hereunder (to the extent not satisfied in
the manner specified in the preceding sentence), shall be effected by payment of
cash or delivery of a cashier's or certified check in the amount of the
indemnification liability. Notwithstanding the joint and several nature of the
representations, warranties and agreements of the Shareholders hereunder, (i)
the indemnification obligations of Charles A. Shoumaker and Therese M. Shoumaker
hereunder shall be limited to the full amount of the Purchase Price, and (ii)
the indemnification obligations of each of the other Shareholders shall be
limited to the respective amounts of the Purchase Price received by them.

         9.06 Payment to the Shareholders of Indemnification Obligation. Any
indemnification to be paid by the Buyer pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Shareholders' Representative in the amount of the indemnification liability as
soon as reasonably practicable after (i) such account is so designated or (ii)
the date on which the amount of the indemnification liability is agreed to by
the Buyer and the Shareholders' Representative. The indemnification obligations
to the Buyer shall be limited to the full amount of the Purchase Price.

         9.07 Survival of Representations; Claims for Indemnification. All
representations and warranties made by the Shareholders, SHRG and SAS in this
Agreement, or in any instrument or document furnished in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall survive the Closing and
any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party for
a period of two years, except for claims, if any, (a) asserted in writing prior
to such date identified as a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section
9, or (b) which are based upon tax matters relating to SHRG, SAS or any of the
Shareholders, which shall survive until finally resolved and satisfied in full.


                                       37
<PAGE>


         9.08 Limits on Indemnification. For purposes of indemnification
pursuant to Sections 9.01 and 9.02, the parties agree that no party may seek
indemnification under this Section 9 unless the aggregate of claims against the
other party or parties exceed $100,000, other than as to matters constituting
fraud or intentional misrepresentation or omission, as to which no "basket"
shall apply. In the event that any party's aggregate claims under this Section 9
exceed $100,000, such party shall be entitled to seek indemnification for all
such claims on a "first dollar" basis, rather than indemnification only for the
amount in excess of $100,000.

10.      Post-Closing Agreements of the Shareholders

         The Shareholders agree that from and after the Closing Date:

         10.01 Proprietary Information.

                  (a) Each of the Shareholders and each of their affiliates (as
such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder) (individually, an "Affiliate" and
collectively "Affiliates") shall hold in confidence and shall use their best
efforts to have all officers, directors and personnel who continue after the
Closing to be employed by any such Shareholder or any Affiliate thereof to hold
in confidence all knowledge and information of a secret or confidential nature
with respect to the business of SHRG and SAS and not to disclose, publish or
make use of the same without the consent of the Buyer, except to the extent that
such information shall have become public knowledge other than by breach of this
Agreement by the Shareholders.

                  (b) If (i) the employment of an officer, director or other
employee of a Shareholder or any Affiliate thereof, to whom secret or
confidential knowledge or information concerning the business of SHRG or SAS has
been disclosed, is terminated and (ii) such individual is subject to an
obligation to maintain such knowledge or information in confidence after such
termination, the Shareholders shall, upon request by the Buyer, take all
reasonable steps at their expense to enforce such confidentiality obligation in
the event of an actual or threatened breach thereof. Any legal counsel retained
by any such Shareholder in connection with any such enforcement or attempted
enforcement shall be selected by such Shareholder, but shall be subject to the
approval of the Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (c) Each Shareholder agrees that the remedy at law for any
breach of this Subsection 10.01 would be inadequate and that the Buyer shall be
entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy it may have upon
breach of any provision of this Subsection 10.01.

         10.02 No Solicitation or Hiring of Former Employees. Except as provided
by law, until January 1, 2005, no Shareholder nor any Affiliate thereof shall
(a) solicit any person who was an employee of either SHRG or SAS on the date
hereof or the Closing Date to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer (or
SHRG or SAS, as the case may be) or to become an employee of such Shareholder or
Affiliate, or (b) hire any person who was such an employee on the date hereof or
on the Closing Date.


                                       38
<PAGE>


         10.03 Non-Competition Agreement.

                  (a) Until January 1, 2005, no Shareholder nor any Affiliate
thereof shall, except as an officer or employee of SHRG or SAS: (i) develop,
manufacture, market or sell any product or service which competes with any
existing or proposed product manufactured or service provided by either SHRG or
SAS on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) engage in any business competitive
with the business of SHRG or SAS as conducted on the date hereof or on the
Closing Date, in the United States or any other country in which SHRG or SAS
conducted its business during the two years prior to the Closing Date.

                  (b) The parties hereto agree that the duration and geographic
scope of the non-competition provision set forth in this Subsection 10.03 are
reasonable. In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction determines
that the duration or the geographic scope, or both, are unreasonable and that
such provision is to that extent unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that
the provision shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest time period
and in the greatest area that would not render it unenforceable. The parties
intend that this non-competition provision shall be deemed to be a series of
separate covenants, one for each and every county of each and every state of the
United States of America and each and every political subdivision of each and
every country outside the United States of America where this provision is
intended to be effective. The Shareholders agree that damages are an inadequate
remedy for any breach of this provision and that the Buyer shall, whether or not
it is pursuing any potential remedies at law, be entitled to equitable relief in
the form of preliminary and permanent injunctions without bond or other security
upon any actual or threatened breach of this non-competition provision.

         10.04 Cooperation.

                  (a) The Shareholders agree that they shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
MEGA Contribution Transaction, including executing and delivering as requested
any and all shareholder and director consents and other documents necessary and
appropriate to consummate such MEGA Contribution Transaction.

                  (b) In the event a claim is asserted after the Closing against
SHRG, SAS, UICI or MEGA with respect to events or conditions occurring or
existing in connection with, or arising out of, (i) the operation of the STAR
Business prior to the Closing, (ii) the ownership, possession, use or sale of
any assets of the STAR Business prior to the Closing, or (iii) the incurrence or
existence of liabilities of the STAR Business prior to the Closing (including
without limitation with respect to tax matters), the Shareholders will cooperate
with the Buyer in the defense of any such claim.

11.      Post-Closing Agreements of the Buyer

         The Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date:

         11.01 Monthly Report of Earned Premium. Beginning with the month of
March, 2002, the Buyer shall send, or shall cause MEGA to send, a monthly report
showing (i) the calculation of Earned Premium in the manner specified in this
Agreement and (ii) the amount of collected


                                       39
<PAGE>


premium with respect to previously reported Earned Premium amounts to the
Shareholders' Representative each month until the occurrence of the Settlement
Date. Each such monthly report shall be sent no later than the 15th day of the
following month.

         11.02 Advisory Board. The Buyer shall not be obligated to create an
Advisory Board with respect to the STAR Business. However, in the event that the
Buyer or MEGA establishes an Advisory Board with respect to the STAR Business,
Charles A. Shoumaker shall be invited to serve as a member of such Advisory
Board on the same terms as the other members thereof who are not executive
employees of UICI or MEGA. This obligation shall terminate on January 1, 2005.

12.      Dispute Resolution.

         12.01 General. In the event that any dispute should arise between the
parties hereto with respect to calculation or determination of the Annualized
Earned Premium Adjustment, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the
procedure specified in Subsection 1.05 hereof. In the event of a dispute
regarding any other matter covered by this Agreement, the parties hereto shall
resolve such dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
12.

         12.02 Consent of the Parties. In the event of any such dispute between
the parties, the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve such
dispute among themselves. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute
within 30 calendar days after the commencement of efforts to resolve the
dispute, the dispute will be submitted to arbitration in accordance with
