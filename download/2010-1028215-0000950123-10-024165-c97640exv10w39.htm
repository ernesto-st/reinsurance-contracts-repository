Loan Lender that Issuing Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned
by it, free and clear of any Liens, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to such Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents or any Lender
Party. If and to the extent that any Revolving Loan Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Letter of Credit Advance available to the Agent, such Revolving Loan Lender agrees to pay to

may hold any such property of Borrower without liability for a reasonable time after any such
notice is received, and that Collateral Agent will have a reasonable time to notify Borrower as to
where Borrower can collect such property. Borrower agrees that if Collateral Agent shall repossess

determine whether such actions are reasonable. Any omission to do any act not requested by
Borrower shall not be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care. Borrower shall at all times be
