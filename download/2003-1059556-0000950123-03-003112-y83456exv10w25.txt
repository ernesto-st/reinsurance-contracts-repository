TO THE PURCHASERS WHOSE NAMES APPEAR IN THE ACCEPTANCE FORM AT THE END HEREOF:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         MOODY'S CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), agrees

         The Company will authorize the issue and sale of $300,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of its 7.61% Senior Notes due 2005. As used herein, the term
"Notes" includes all notes originally issued pursuant to this Agreement and any
other notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13. The Notes
shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1, with such changes
therefrom, if any, as may be approved by each Purchaser and the Company. Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references
to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule
or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.

         Payment of the principal of, Make-Whole Amount (if any) and interest on
the Notes shall be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors as contemplated by
Section 9.6 and as provided in the Subsidiary Guarantees.

2.SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will
issue and sell to each Purchaser and each Purchaser will purchase from the
Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount
specified opposite such Purchaser's name in Schedule A at the purchase price of
100% of the principal amount thereof. The Purchasers' obligations hereunder are

any Person for the performance or non-performance of any obligation by any other
Purchaser hereunder.

         The sale and purchase of the Notes to be purchased by each Purchaser
shall occur at the offices of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, One Chase
Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10005, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at
a closing (the "Closing") on October 3, 2000. At the Closing the Company will
deliver to each Purchaser the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser in the
form of a single Note (or such greater number of Notes in denominations of at
least $100,000 as such Purchaser may request) dated the date of the Closing and
registered in such Purchaser's name (or in the name of such Purchaser's

to any Purchaser as provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions
specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to such Purchaser's
satisfaction, such Purchaser shall, at such Purchaser's election, be relieved of
all further obligations under this Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights
such Purchaser may have by reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.

4.CONDITIONS TO CLOSING.

         Each Purchaser's obligation to purchase and pay for the Notes to be
sold to such Purchaser at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to such
Purchaser's satisfaction, prior to or at the Closing, of the following

shall be correct when made and at the time of the Closing.

continuing.

satisfactory to such Purchaser, dated the date of the Closing (a) from Simpson

forth in Exhibit 4.4(a) and covering such other matters incident to the
transactions contemplated hereby as such Purchaser or the Purchasers' counsel

limitation, Regulation U, T or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System) and (iii) not subject such Purchaser to any tax, penalty or
liability under or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation, which law or
regulation was not in effect on the date hereof. If requested by such Purchaser,
such Purchaser shall have received an Officer's Certificate from the Company
certifying as to such matters of fact as such Purchaser may reasonably specify
to enable such Purchaser to determine whether such purchase is so permitted.

4.6 SALE OF OTHER NOTES.

         Contemporaneously with the Closing the Company shall sell to each other
Purchaser and each other Purchaser shall purchase the Notes to be purchased by
it at the Closing as specified in Schedule A.

all such counterpart originals or certified or other copies of such documents as

         The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions
as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or hold
under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact
the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof.

5.2 AUTHORIZATION, ETC.

         This Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement constitutes, and
upon execution and delivery thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)

laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

                                       4
<PAGE>
5.3 DISCLOSURE.

         The Company, through its co-agents, Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and The
Bank of New York, has delivered to each Purchaser a copy of an Offering
Placement Memorandum, dated August 2000 (the "MEMORANDUM"), relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, this
Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or other writings
identified in Schedule 5.3 and the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5,
taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except for
the Spin-Off and as disclosed in the Memorandum or as expressly described in
Schedule 5.3, or in one of the documents, certificates or other writings
identified therein, or in the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since
December 31, 1999, there has been no change in the financial condition,
operations, business or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
except changes that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.4 ORGANIZATION AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF SUBSIDIARIES.

         (a) Schedule 5.4 is (except as noted therein) a complete and correct
list of the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary, the correct
name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization, the percentage of shares of
each class of its capital stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned by
the Company and each other Subsidiary, and whether, as of the date of the
Closing, such Subsidiary shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor.

         (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company

         (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions
as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and
authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold
under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.

5.5 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

         The Company has delivered to each Purchaser copies of the combined
financial statements of the Company listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said
financial statements fairly present in all material respects the combined
financial position of the Company as of the respective dates thereof and the
combined results of its operations and cash flows for the respective periods so
specified in conformity with GAAP (subject, in the case of any interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

<PAGE>
5.6 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER INSTRUMENTS, ETC.

         The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Notes will not (i) contravene, result in any breach of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of
any property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or
by-laws, or any other Material agreement or instrument to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their respective properties may be bound or affected, (ii) conflict with or
result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order,
judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority
applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or (iii) violate any provision of
any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable
to the Company or any Subsidiary.

5.7 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC.

         No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or the
Notes.

5.8 LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF STATUTES AND ORDERS.

         (a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the Company or any
Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any
order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental
Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or
regulation (including without limitation Environmental Laws) of any Governmental
Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.9 TAXES.

         The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all income tax returns that
are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes
shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments
payable by them, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and
payable and before they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and
assessments (i) the amount of which is not individually or in the aggregate
Material or (ii) the amount, applicability or validity of which is currently
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to
which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has established adequate
reserves in accordance with GAAP.

                                       6
<PAGE>
5.10 TITLE TO PROPERTY; LEASES.

         The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to
their respective Material properties, including all such properties reflected in
the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to
have been acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after said date (except as
sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case
free and clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement, except for those defects
in title and Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. All leases that the Company or any Subsidiary is party
to as lessee and that individually or in the aggregate are Material are valid
and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.

5.11 LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC.

         Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11, the Company and its Subsidiaries
own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents,
copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that
are Material, without known conflict with the rights of others, except for those
conflicts that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.12 COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

         (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and administered
each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of
noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or
excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined
in Section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or
exists that would reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such
liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any
Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty
or excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than
such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate
Material.

         (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each
of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such
Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation
report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan
allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term "benefit liabilities" has the
meaning specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and

Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any
of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with,
any person other than the Purchasers and not more than 80 other Institutional
Investors, each of which has been offered the Notes at a private sale for

will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to
the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

5.14 USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS.

         The Company will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as set

carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of
buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to
involve the Company in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or
to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12
CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more than 5% of the value of the

Regulation U.

payment of any principal or interest on any Indebtedness of the Company or such

                                       8
<PAGE>
Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any Indebtedness of
the Company or any Subsidiary the outstanding principal amount of which exceeds
$5,000,000 that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both,
would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness to become due and
payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of
payment.

5.16 FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS, ETC.

         Neither the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of

Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating thereto.

         Company and its Subsidiaries), all at such times and as often as may be
         requested.

8.PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

8.1 MATURITY.

         As provided therein, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes
shall be due and payable on September 30, 2005.

8.2 OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS WITH MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

         The Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay
at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not
less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in
the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid,
plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with respect to
such principal amount. The Company will give each holder of Notes written notice
of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not
more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment. Each such notice
shall specify such date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be
prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to
be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the interest to be
paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid,

prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes a certificate of a
Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as
of the specified prepayment date.

8.3 ALLOCATION OF PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS.

         In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes, the principal

unpaid principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

<PAGE>
8.4 MATURITY; SURRENDER, ETC.

         In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the
principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and
payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such
principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if
any. From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such
principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall
cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the
Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in
lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

8.5 PURCHASE OF NOTES.

         The Company will not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase,
redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the
outstanding Notes except (a) upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes or (b) pursuant to an
offer to purchase made by the Company or an Affiliate pro rata to the holders of
all Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. Any such
offer shall provide each holder with sufficient information to enable it to make
an informed decision with respect to such offer, and shall remain open for at
least twenty Business Days. If the holders of more than 50% of the principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding accept such offer, the Company shall
promptly notify the remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for
the acceptance by holders of Notes of such offer shall be extended by the number
of days necessary to give each such remaining holder at least five Business Days
from its receipt of such notice to accept such offer. The Company will promptly
cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment,
prepayment or purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and
no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

8.6 MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

         The term "MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT" means, with respect to any Note, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled
Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of
such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be
less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the
following terms have the following meanings:

                  "CALLED PRINCIPAL" means, with respect to any Note, the
         principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or
         has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to
         Section 12.1, as the context requires.

                  "DISCOUNTED VALUE" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled
         Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective
         scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
         Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a
         discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
         interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with
         respect to such Called Principal.

                                       15
<PAGE>
                  "REINVESTMENT YIELD" means, with respect to the Called
         Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by (i)
         the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
         second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such
         Called Principal, on the display designated as Bloomberg Financial
         Markets "Page PX1" (or such other display as may replace Bloomberg
         Financial Markets "Page PX1") for actively traded U.S. Treasury
         securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of
         such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such
         yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of
         such time are not ascertainable, the Treasury Constant Maturity Series
         Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so
         reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date
         with respect to such Called Principal, in U.S. Federal Reserve
         Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor
         publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a
         constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called
         Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be
         determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill
         quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted
         financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the
         actively traded "on the run" U.S. Treasury security with the maturity
         closest to and greater than the Remaining Average Life and (2) the
         actively traded "on the run" U.S. Treasury security with the maturity
         closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.

                  "REMAINING AVERAGE LIFE" means, with respect to any Called
         Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth
         year) obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum
         of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of
         each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal
         by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year)
         that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such
         Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled
         Payment.

                  "REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS" means, with respect to the
         Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and
         interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with
         respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal
         were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such
         Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be
         made under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next
         succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of
         interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on
         such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or 12.1.

                  "SETTLEMENT DATE" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid
         pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately
         due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

<PAGE>
9.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply with
all laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them
is subject, including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, and will obtain
and maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other
governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective
properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in each case to the
extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or
governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain or maintain in effect
such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental
authorizations would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a materially adverse effect on the business, operations,
affairs, financial condition, properties or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

9.2 INSURANCE.

         The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain,
with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their
respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies,
of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles,
co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with
respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established
reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.

9.3 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES.

         The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to maintain
and keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in
good repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so
that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted
at all times, provided that this Section shall not prevent the Company or any
Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its
properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business
and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the business,
operations, affairs, financial condition, properties or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

9.4 PAYMENT OF TAXES.

         The Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to file all
income tax or similar tax returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and
to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and
all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or levies payable by any of
them, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and
before they have become delinquent, provided that neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment if (i) the amount, applicability
or validity thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely
basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Company or a
Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on
the books of the Company or such Subsidiary or (ii) the nonpayment of all such
taxes and assessments in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected

                                       17
<PAGE>
to have a materially adverse effect on the business, operations, affairs,
financial condition, properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

9.5 CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC.

         Subject to Section 10.2, the Company will at all times preserve and
keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, and the Company will at
all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of
each of its Subsidiaries and all rights and franchises of the Company and its
Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the termination
of or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate
existence of any Subsidiary or any such right or franchise would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the
business, operations, affairs, financial condition, properties or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

9.6 SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS.

         (a) The Company will ensure that each Subsidiary that as of the date of
Closing or at any time thereafter has outstanding any Indebtedness under, or any
a Guaranty with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries outstanding under, the Credit Facility (or is otherwise a
co-obligor or jointly liable with respect to any such Indebtedness) is or will
become a Subsidiary Guarantor.

         (b) Upon notice by the Company to each holder of a Note (which notice
shall contain a certification by the Company as to the matters specified in
clauses (x) and (y) below), a Subsidiary Guarantor shall cease to be a
Subsidiary Guarantor and shall be released from its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee if (x) such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have outstanding
any Indebtedness under, or any Guaranty with respect to any Indebtedness of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries outstanding under, the Credit Facility (and
shall not otherwise be a co-obligor or jointly liable with respect to any such
other Indebtedness) and (y) both immediately before and after giving effect to
such release no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing. If a Subsidiary again incurs any Indebtedness under, or guarantees
any Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outstanding under,
the Credit Facility (or otherwise becomes a co-obligor or jointly liable with
respect to any such Indebtedness), then the Company will cause such Subsidiary
to become a Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions of Subsection
(a) above.

10.NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

         The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding:

10.1 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.

         The Company will not and will not permit any Subsidiary to enter into
directly or indirectly any Material transaction or Material group of related
transactions (including without limitation the purchase, lease, sale or exchange
of properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate
(other than the Company or another Subsidiary), except pursuant to the
reasonable requirements of the Company's or such Subsidiary's business and upon
fair and

                                       18
<PAGE>
reasonable terms no less favorable to the Company or such Subsidiary than would
be obtainable in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not an
Affiliate.

10.2 MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, ETC.

         The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with any other
corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets in a
single transaction or series of transactions to any Person unless:

                  (a) the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor
         of such merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, transfer or
         lease substantially all of the assets of the Company, as the case may
         be, shall be a solvent corporation organized and existing under the
         laws of the United States or any State thereof (including the District
         of Columbia), and, if the Company is not such corporation, such
         corporation shall have executed and delivered to each holder of any
         Notes its assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance
         of each covenant and condition of this Agreement and the Notes; and

                  (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no
         Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
         (including, without limitation, any Default or Event of Default of
         Section 10.6 or 10.7 as the provisions of such sections shall be
         calculated on a pro forma basis as of the date of such transaction).

No such conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of the assets of the
Company shall have the effect of releasing the Company or any successor
corporation that shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in
this Section 10.2 from its liability under this Agreement or the Notes.

10.3 DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

         The Company will not and will not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, make any sale, transfer, lease (as lessor), loan or other
disposition of any property or assets (an "Asset Sale") other than:

                  (a) Asset Sales in the ordinary course of business;

                  (b) Asset Sales by a Subsidiary to the Company or to a
         Wholly-Owned Subsidiary;

                  (c) Non-Recourse Asset Sales of accounts receivable of the
         Company or any Subsidiary on commercially reasonable terms for cash or
         other highly liquid investments; and

                  (d) other Asset Sales, provided that


                           (i) immediately after giving effect thereto, no
                  Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                  continuing, and

                                       19
<PAGE>
                           (ii) the aggregate net book value of property or
                  assets disposed of in such proposed Asset Sale and all other
                  Asset Sales not permitted by clause (a), (b) or (c) above
                  during the preceding 36 consecutive calendar months does not
                  exceed 30% of the average of Consolidated Total Assets,
                  calculated using figures as of the last day of the twelve most
                  recently ended quarterly fiscal periods; and, provided
                  further, that for purposes of this clause (ii), there shall be
                  excluded from the calculation of the aggregate net book value
                  of property or assets disposed of during any 36 month period
                  any Asset Sale if and to the extent that an amount equal to
                  the net proceeds realized upon such Asset Sale is applied or
                  has been applied by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
                  case may be, (A) within one years time before or after the
                  effective date of such Asset Sale (but in all events, without
                  duplication), (1) to reinvest in assets used in the business
                  of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (2) to purchase the
                  capital stock of any Person that, as a result of such capital
                  stock purchase, becomes a Subsidiary or (B) within 180 days
                  after the effective date of such Asset Sale, to repay
                  long-term Indebtedness (including any optional prepayment of
                  the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2) which is not subordinated
                  in right of payment to the Notes.

For purposes of this Section 10.3, any stock of a Subsidiary that is the subject
of an Asset Sale shall be valued at the aggregate net book value of the assets
of such Subsidiary multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
aggregate number of shares of stock of such Subsidiary disposed of in such Asset
Sale and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of stock of
such Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to such Asset Sale.

                  aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness secured by all such

                  improvements then being financed;

                           (ii) in the case of any Person that after the date of

         any such event or events described in clauses (i) through (vi) above,
         either

                                       24

12.REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

12.1 ACCELERATION.

         (a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Company described in
paragraph (g) or (h) of Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in
clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by
virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has
occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become immediately
due and payable.

         (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Required Holders may at any time at their option, by notice or notices to the
Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and
payable.

         (c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of
Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes at the
time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or
their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held by
it or them to be immediately due and payable.

         Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1,
whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and
the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of
such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall
all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or
are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

12.2 OTHER REMEDIES.

         If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately
due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time
outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an
action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding,

                                       25
<PAGE>
whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any
Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or
thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by
law or otherwise.

12.3 RESCISSION.

         At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant
to clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the Required Holders, by written notice to
the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if
(a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid
other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue
principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default
Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts
that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or
have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been
entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No
rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any
subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

12.4 NO WAIVERS OR ELECTION OF REMEDIES, EXPENSES, ETC.

         No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note
in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof or by
any Subsidiary Guarantee shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy
referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity,
by statute or otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under
Section 15, the Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such
holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this Section 12,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and
disbursements.

13.REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

13.1 REGISTRATION OF NOTES.

         The Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for
the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of
each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and address
of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in such register.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in whose name
any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder
thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any
notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a
Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a
complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders
of Notes.

                                       26
<PAGE>
13.2     TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES.

         Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the
Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender
for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or
his attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for
notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall
execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below), one or
more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the
surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such
holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1. Each
such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest
shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the
surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental
charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be
transferred in denominations of less than $100,000, provided that if necessary
to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of
Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $100,000. Any transferee,
by its acceptance of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee),
shall be deemed to have made the representation set forth in Section 6.2.

13.3 REPLACEMENT OF NOTES.

         Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it
of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note
(which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from
such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation), and

                  (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
         reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note
         is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a
         Note with a minimum net worth of at least $10,000,000 in excess of the
         outstanding principal amount of such Note, such Person's own unsecured
         agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or

                  (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
         thereof,

the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new
Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been
paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid
thereon.

14.PAYMENTS ON NOTES.

14.1 PLACE OF PAYMENT.

         Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if
any, and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in New
York, New York at the principal office of The Chase Manhattan Bank in such
jurisdiction. The Company may at any

                                       27
<PAGE>
time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment of the
Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the principal office of
the Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust
company in such jurisdiction.

14.2 HOME OFFICE PAYMENT.

         So long as any Purchaser or any nominee of such Purchaser shall be the
holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in
such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such
Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at
the address specified for such purpose below such Purchaser's name in Schedule
A, or by such other method or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have
from time to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without
the presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation
thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with
or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, such
Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after
any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the
place of payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section
14.1 Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by any Purchaser or
any nominee of such Purchaser, such Purchaser will, at its election, either
endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which
interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Note to the Company in exchange
for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will afford the
benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct
or indirect transferee of any Note purchased by any Purchaser under this
Agreement and that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as the
Purchasers have made in this Section 14.2.

15.EXPENSES, ETC.

15.1 TRANSACTION EXPENSES.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Company will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees of a special counsel and, if reasonably required, local or other counsel)
incurred by the Purchasers and each other holder of a Note in connection with
such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents
under or in respect of this Agreement, the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee

without limitation: (a) the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing or
defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under
this Agreement, the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee or in responding to any

reason of being a holder of any Note, and (b) the costs and expenses, including
financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Company or any Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out
or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The

harmless from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of
brokers and finders (other than those retained by such Purchaser or other
holder).

                                       28
<PAGE>
15.2 SURVIVAL.

         The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive the
payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.

16. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

         All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer
by each Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the
payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note,
regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any
Purchaser or any other holder of a Note. All statements contained in any
certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the
Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
and the Notes embody the entire agreement and understanding between the
Purchasers and the Company and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
relating to the subject matter hereof.

17.AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

17.1 REQUIREMENTS.

         This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any
term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or
prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Company and the
Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof, or any defined term (as it
is used therein), will be effective as to any Purchaser unless consented to by
such Purchaser in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the
written consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding affected
thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or
rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal
of, or reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of
interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage
of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections
8,11(a),11(b),12,17 or 20.

17.2 SOLICITATION OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

         (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes
(irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient
information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to
enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to
any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions
hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct
copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the
date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or
approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

                                       29
<PAGE>
         (b) Payment. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause
to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional
interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of Notes as
consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of
Notes or any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof
unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently
granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding
even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.

17.3 BINDING EFFECT, ETC.

         Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17
applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each
future holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether such
Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or
waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or
Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent
thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor
any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as
a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used herein, the term
"this Agreement" and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from
time to time be amended or supplemented.

17.4 NOTES HELD BY COMPANY, ETC.

         Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the
requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding
approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this
Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided
herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a
specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

18.NOTICES.

         All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing and sent (a) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a
confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service
(charges prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested (postage prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service
(with charges prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:

                  (i) if to any Purchaser or its nominee, to such Purchaser or
         nominee at the address specified for such communications in Schedule A,
         or at such other address as such Purchaser or nominee shall have
         specified to the Company in writing,

                  (ii) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at
         such address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company
         in writing, or

                                       30
<PAGE>
                  (iii) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set
         forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of Jeanne Dering, with a
         copy to Felix Sotomayor, or at such other address as the Company shall
         have specified to the holder of each Note in writing.

Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when actually received.

19.REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

         This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without
limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by any Purchaser at the Closing (except the
Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other
information previously or hereafter furnished to any Purchaser, may be
reproduced by such Purchaser by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm,
microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and such Purchaser
may destroy any original document so reproduced. The Company agrees and
stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such
reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any
judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such Purchaser in the
regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further
reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This
Section 19 shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from
contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the
original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such
reproduction.

20.CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" means
information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly
marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by such
Purchaser as being confidential information of the Company or such Subsidiary,
provided that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known
or otherwise known to such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b)
subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by such Purchaser
or any person acting on such Purchaser's behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to
such Purchaser other than through disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary or
(d) constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser under Section
7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. Each Purchaser will maintain the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures
adopted by such Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential information of
third parties delivered to such Purchaser, provided that such Purchaser may
deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) such Purchaser's directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such
disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment
represented by such Purchaser's Notes), (ii) such Purchaser's financial advisors
and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential
Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii)
any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which such
Purchaser sells or offers to sell such Note or any part thereof or any
participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt
of such

                                       31
<PAGE>
Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (v)
any Person from which such Purchaser offers to purchase any security of the
Company (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such
Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi)
any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such
Purchaser, (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any
similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires
access to information about such Purchaser's investment portfolio or (viii) any
other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or
appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order
applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal
process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which such Purchaser is a
party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the
extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to
be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
rights and remedies under such Purchaser's Notes or this Agreement. Each holder
of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were
a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection
with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be
delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other
than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such holder
will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this
Section 20.

21.SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

         Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of such
Purchaser's Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has
agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice
shall be signed by both such Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such
Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a
confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the
representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such notice, any
reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21)
shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of such original Purchaser.
In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser hereunder and
such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes
then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such
transfer, any reference to such Affiliate as a "Purchaser" in this Agreement
(other than in this Section 21) shall no longer be deemed to refer to such
Affiliate, but shall refer to such original Purchaser, and such original
Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes
under this Agreement.

22.MISCELLANEOUS.

22.1 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

         All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on
behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent
holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.

                                       32
<PAGE>
22.2 PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS.

         Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary
notwithstanding, any payment of principal of or Make-whole Amount or interest on
any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in
the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

22.3 SEVERABILITY.

         Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

22.4 CONSTRUCTION.

         Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express
provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained
herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an
express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other
covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person,
or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be
applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

22.5 COUNTERPARTS.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each
signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.

one or more of its Subsidiaries or such Person and one or more of its
Subsidiaries (unless such partnership or joint venture can and does ordinarily
take major business actions without the prior approval of such Person or one or

         "SWAPS" means, with respect to any Person, payment obligations with
respect to interest rate swaps, currency swaps and similar obligations
obligating such Person to make payments, whether periodically or upon the
happening of a contingency. For the purposes of this Agreement, the amount of
the obligation under any Swap shall be the amount determined in respect thereof
as of the end of the then most recently ended fiscal quarter of such Person,
based on the assumption that such Swap had terminated at the end of such fiscal
quarter, and in making such determination, if any agreement relating to such
Swap provides for the netting of amounts payable by and to such Person
thereunder or if any such agreement provides for the simultaneous

shall have completed an acquisition of all or a substantial part of the assets,
or a going concern business or division, of any Person during such period or
(ii) if the Company shall have merged with any Person during such period or
(iii) if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have disposed of all or a
substantial part of its assets or a going concern business or division during
such period, in each case, EBITDA for such period shall be determined on a pro
forma basis as if such acquisition, disposition or merger, and the incurrence of
any related Indebtedness, had occurred on the first day of such period.

         "WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY" means, at any time, any Subsidiary of which
one hundred percent (100%) of all of the equity interests (except directors'
qualifying shares) and voting interests thereof are owned by any one or more of
