            SECTION 2.01 COMMITMENTS TO LEND.

the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Revolving Loans to
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) from time to time during the
Availability Period in amounts such that its Revolving Outstandings shall not
exceed (after giving effect to all Revolving Loans repaid, all reimbursements of
LC Disbursements made, and all Refunded Swingline Loans paid concurrently with
the making of any Revolving Loans) its Revolving Commitment; provided that,
immediately after giving effect to each such Revolving Loan, (i) the aggregate
Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount and (ii)
with respect to each Revolving Lender individually, such Lender's outstanding
Revolving Loans plus its (other than the Swingline Lender's in its capacity as
such) Participation Interests in outstanding Swingline Loans plus its

Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount. Each

ratably in proportion to their respective Term B Commitments. The Term B
Commitments are not revolving in nature, and amounts repaid or prepaid prior to
the Term B Maturity Date may not be reborrowed.

            (c)   Swingline Loans.

                  (i)   The Swingline Lender agrees, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein and in the other Senior Finance Documents, to
make a portion of the Revolving Commitments available to the Borrower from time
to time during the Availability Period by making Swingline Loans to the Borrower
in Dollars (each such loan, a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the "Swingline
Loans"); provided that (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans
outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Swingline Committed Amount, (B)
with regard to each Lender individually (other than the Swingline Lender in its
capacity as such), such Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans plus its
Participation Interests in outstanding Swingline Loans plus its Participation

                                     - 42 -
<PAGE>

Interests in outstanding LC Obligations shall not at any time exceed such
Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount, (C)
with regard to the Revolving Lenders collectively, the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of
Revolving Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of LC Obligations
outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount and (D) the
Swingline Committed Amount shall not exceed the aggregate of the Revolving
Commitments then in effect. Swingline Loans shall be made and maintained as Base
Rate Loans and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof prior to the Swingline Termination Date. Swingline Loans may be made
notwithstanding the fact that such Swingline Loans, when aggregated with the
Swingline Lender's other Revolving Outstandings, exceeds its Revolving
Commitment. The proceeds of a Swingline Borrowing may not be used, in whole or
in part, to refund any prior Swingline Borrowing.

                  (ii)  The principal amount of all Swingline Loans shall be due
and payable on the earliest of (A) the Swingline Termination Date, (B) the
occurrence of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding with respect to the Borrower or
(C) the acceleration of any Loan or the termination of the Revolving Commitments
pursuant to Section 8.02.

                  (iii) With respect to any Swingline Loans that have not been
voluntarily prepaid by the Borrower or paid by the Borrower when due under
clause (ii) above, the Swingline Lender (by request to the Administrative Agent)
or the Administrative Agent at any time may, on one Business Day's notice,
require each Revolving Lender, including the Swingline Lender, and each such
Lender hereby agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 2.01(c), to make
a Revolving Loan (which shall be initially funded as a Base Rate Loan) in an
amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the amount of
the Swingline Loans (the "Refunded Swingline Loans") outstanding on the date
notice is given.

                  (iv)  In the case of Revolving Loans made by Lenders other
than the Swingline Lender under clause (iii) above, each such Revolving Lender
shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to the Administrative
Agent, in same day funds, at the Administrative Agent's Office, not later than
1:00 P.M. on the Business Day next succeeding the date such notice is given. The
proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be immediately delivered to the Swingline
Lender (and not to the Borrower) and applied to repay the Refunded Swingline
Loans. On the day such Revolving Loans are made, the Swingline Lender's
Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Refunded Swingline Loans shall be deemed
to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by the Swingline Lender
and such portion of the Swingline Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be
outstanding as Swingline Loans and shall instead be outstanding as Revolving
Loans. The Borrower authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender
to charge the Borrower's account with the Administrative Agent (up to the amount
available in such account) in order to pay immediately to the Swingline Lender
the amount of such Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received from
the Revolving Lenders, including amounts deemed to be received from the
Swingline Lender, are not sufficient to repay in full such Refunded Swingline
Loans. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to the
Swingline Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the
Swingline Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or
otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all
Revolving Lenders in the manner contemplated by Section 2.13.

                  (v)   A copy of each notice given by the Swingline Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) shall be promptly delivered by the Swingline
Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Upon the making of a
Revolving Loan by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this Section 2.01(c), the
amount so funded shall no longer be owed in respect of its Participation
Interest in the related Refunded Swingline Loans.

                  (vi)  If as a result of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding,
Revolving Loans are not made pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) sufficient to
repay any amounts owed to the Swingline Lender as a result of a nonpayment of
outstanding Swingline Loans, each Revolving Lender agrees to purchase, and shall
be deemed to have purchased, a participation in such outstanding Swingline Loans
in an amount equal to its Revolving Commitment Percentage of the unpaid amount
together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one Business Day's notice from the
Swingline Lender, each Revolving Lender shall deliver to the Swingline Lender an
amount equal to its respective Participation Interest in such Swingline Loans in
same day funds at the office of the Swingline Lender specified or referred to in
Section 10.01. In order to evidence such Participation Interest each Revolving
Lender agrees to enter into a participation agreement at the request of the
Swingline Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to all parties.
In the event any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Swingline
Lender the amount of such Revolving Lender's Participation Interest as provided
in this Section 2.01(c)(vi), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover
such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest at the
customary rate set by the Swingline Lender for correction of errors among banks
in New York City for one Business Day and thereafter at the Base Rate plus the
then Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans.

                  (vii) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving
Loans pursuant to clause (iv) above and to purchase Participation Interests in
outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to clause (vi) above shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (without
limitation) (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Revolving Lender or any other Person may have against the Swingline
Lender, the Borrower, Holdings or any other Credit Party, (ii) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the termination or reduction
in the amount of the Revolving Commitments after any such Swingline Loans were
made, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Borrower, Holdings or any other Person, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any
other Senior Finance Document by the Borrower or any other Lender, (v) whether
any condition specified in Article IV is then satisfied or (vi) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the forgoing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
Swingline Lender's demand therefor, and until such time as such Lender makes the
required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have
outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid Participation Interest
for all purposes of the Senior Finance Documents other than those provisions
requiring the other Lenders to purchase a participation therein. Further, such
Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments made of principal
and interest on its Loans, and any other amounts due to it hereunder to the
Swingline Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the amount of the Participation
Interest in Swingline Loans that such Lender failed to purchase pursuant to this
Section 2.01(c)(vii) until such amount has been purchased (as a result of such
assignment or otherwise).

            SECTION 2.02 NOTICE OF BORROWINGS.

            (a)   Borrowings Other Than Swingline Loans. Except in the case of
Swingline Loans, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a Notice of
Borrowing (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by a Notice of Borrowing) not
later than 12 noon. on (i) the Business Day of each Base Rate Borrowing and (ii)
the third Business Day before each Eurodollar Borrowing. Each such Notice of
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify:

                        (A)   the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
            Business Day;

                        (B)   the aggregate principal amount of such Borrowing;

                                     - 44 -
<PAGE>

                        (C)   the Class and initial Type of the Loans comprising
            such Borrowing;

                        (D)   in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
            duration of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto, subject
            to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period and to
            Section 2.06(a); and

                        (E)   the location and number of the Borrower's account
            to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
            requirements of Section 2.03.

If the duration of the initial Interest Period is not specified with respect to
any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an initial Interest Period of one month, subject to the provisions of
the definition of Interest Period and to Section 2.06(a).

            (b)   Swingline Borrowings. The Borrower shall request a Swingline
Loan by written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing)
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-4 hereto (a "Swingline Loan Request") to
the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 12 Noon on the
Business Day of the requested Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify (i) that a Swingline Loan is requested, (ii) the
date of the requested Swingline Loan (which shall be a Business Day) and (iii)
the principal amount of the Swingline Loan requested and, (iv) the location and
number of the Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall
comply with the requirements of Section 2.03. Each Swingline Loan shall be made
as a Base Rate Loan.

            SECTION 2.03 NOTICE TO LENDERS; FUNDING OF LOANS.

            (a)   Notice to Lenders. Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such Lender's ratable
share (if any) of the Borrowing referred to therein.

            (b)   Funding of Loans.

                  (i)   On the date of each Borrowing (other than a Swingline
      Borrowing), each Lender participating therein shall make available its
      share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other immediately available funds,
      to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office. Unless
      the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition
      specified in Article IV has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent
      shall promptly distribute the proceeds to an account designated by the
      Borrower from time to time in the Applicable Notice of Borrowing (provided
      such account is the subject of an Account Control Agreement (as defined in
      the Security Agreement) and is in full force and effect at the date
      thereof), or if not so identified, credit the amounts so received to the
      general deposit account of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent or,
      if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition
      precedent herein shall not have been met, promptly return the amounts
      received from the Lenders in like funds.

                  (ii)  Not later than 3:00 P.M. on the date of each Swingline
      Borrowing, the Swingline Lender shall, unless the Administrative Agent
      shall have notified the Swingline Lender that any applicable condition
      specified in Article IV has not been satisfied, make available the amount
      of such Swingline Borrowing, in Dollars in Federal or other immediately
      available funds, to the Borrower at an account designated by the Borrower
      from time to time in the Swingline Loan Request (provided such account is
      the subject of an Account Control Agreement (as defined

                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>

      in the Security Agreement) and is in full force and effect at the date
      thereof), or if not so identified, to the Borrower at the Swingline
      Lender's address referred to in Section 10.01.

            (c)   Funding by the Administrative Agent in Anticipation of Amounts
Due from the Lenders. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (b) of this Section 2.03, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so
made such share available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith within
two Business Days of such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until
the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) a rate per
annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate
applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.06, in the case of the Borrower, and
(ii) the Federal Funds Rate, in the case of such Lender. If such Lender shall
repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so
repaid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.

            (d)   Obligations of Lenders Several. The failure of any Lender to
make a Loan required to be made by it as part of any Borrowing hereunder shall
not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make any
Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on
such date of Borrowing.

            (e)   Failed Loans. If any Lender shall fail to make any Loan (a
"Failed Loan") which such Lender is otherwise obligated hereunder to make to the
Borrower on the date of Borrowing thereof, and the Administrative Agent shall
not have received notice from the Borrower or such Lender that any condition
precedent to the making of the Failed Loan has not been satisfied, then, until
such Lender shall have made or be deemed to have made (pursuant to the last
sentence of this subsection (e)) the Failed Loan in full or the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower or such Lender that any
condition precedent to the making of the Failed Loan was not satisfied at the
time the Failed Loan was to have been made, whenever the Administrative Agent
shall receive any amount from the Borrower for the account of such Lender, (i)
the amount so received (up to the amount of such Failed Loan) will, upon receipt
by the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been paid to the Lender in
satisfaction of the obligation for which paid, without actual disbursement of
such amount to the Lender, (ii) the Lender will be deemed to have made the same
amount available to the Administrative Agent for disbursement as a Loan to the
Borrower (up to the amount of such Failed Loan) and (iii) the Administrative
Agent will disburse such amount (up to the amount of the Failed Loan) to the
Borrower or, if the Administrative Agent has previously made such amount
available to the Borrower on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the provisions
hereof, reimburse itself (up to the amount of the amount made available to the
Borrower); provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall have no
obligation to disburse any such amount to the Borrower or otherwise apply it or
deem it applied as provided herein unless the Administrative Agent shall have
determined in its sole discretion that to so disburse such amount will not
violate any law, rule, regulation or requirement applicable to the
Administrative Agent. Upon any such disbursement by the Administrative Agent,
such Lender shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan of the same Class as
the Failed Loan to the Borrower in satisfaction, to the extent thereof, of such
Lender's obligation to make the Failed Loan.

            SECTION 2.04 EVIDENCE OF LOANS.

                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>

            (a)   Lender Accounts. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with
its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including
the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time
to time under this Agreement.

            (b)   Administrative Agent Records. The Administrative Agent shall
maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, the Class and Type of each Loan made and the Interest Period, if any,
applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable
or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and
(iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from
the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

            (c)   Evidence of Debt. The entries made in the accounts maintained
pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 2.04 shall be prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to
maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans made to it in accordance with
their terms.

            (d)   Notes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if any Lender shall request and receive a Note or Notes as provided in Section
10.06 or otherwise, then the Loans of such Lender shall be evidenced by one or
more Revolving Notes or Term B Notes, as applicable, in each case, substantially
in the form of Exhibit B-1 or B-2 as applicable, payable to the order of such
Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office in an amount equal to
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Loan or Term B
Loan, as applicable. If requested by the Swingline Lender, the Swingline Loans
shall be evidenced by a single Swingline Note, substantially in the form of
Exhibit B-3, payable to the order of the Swingline Lender in an amount equal to
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Swingline Loans.

            (e)   Note Endorsements. Each Lender having one or more Notes issued
by the Borrower shall record the date, amount, Class and Type of each Loan made
by it to the Borrower evidenced by such Note and the date and amount of each
payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto, and may, if such
Lender so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of any Note,
endorse on the reverse side or on the schedule, if any, forming a part thereof
appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect to each
outstanding Loan evidenced thereby; provided that the failure of any Lender to
make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder or under any such Note. Each Lender is hereby irrevocably
authorized by the Borrower so to endorse each of its Notes and to attach to and
make a part of each of its Notes a continuation of any such schedule as and when
required.

            SECTION 2.05 LETTERS OF CREDIT.

            (a)   Existing Letters of Credit. On the Closing Date, each Issuing
Lender that has issued an Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed, without
further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Revolving Lender, and
each such Revolving Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party
hereto, to have purchased from each such Issuing Lender, without recourse or
warranty, an undivided participation interest in such Existing Letter of Credit
and the related LC Obligations in the proportion its Revolving Commitment
Percentage bears to the Revolving Committed Amount (although any fronting fee
payable under Section 2.11 shall be payable directly to the Administrative Agent
for the accounting of each applicable Issuing Lender, and the Lenders (other
than the applicable Issuing Lender) shall have no right to receive any portion
of such fronting fee) and any security therefore or guaranty

                                     - 47 -
<PAGE>

pertaining thereto. On and after the Closing Date, each Existing Letter of
Credit shall constitute a Letter of Credit for all purposes hereof.

            (b)   Additional Letters of Credit. The Administrative Agent agrees,
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue letters of
credit or guarantees (each an "LC Support Agreement") to an Issuing Lender to
induce such Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars
from time to time before the 30th day prior to the Revolving Termination Date
for the account, and upon the request, of the Borrower and in support of (i)
trade obligations of the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries, which shall be
payable at sight (each such letter of credit, a "Trade Letter of Credit" and,
collectively, the "Trade Letters of Credit") and (ii) such other obligations of
the Borrower that are acceptable to the Administrative Agent (each such letter
of credit, a "Standby Letter of Credit" and, collectively, the "Standby Letters
of Credit"); provided that, immediately after each Letter of Credit is issued,
(i) the aggregate LC Obligations shall not exceed $15,000,000 (the "LC Committed
Amount"), (ii) the Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving
Committed Amount, and (iii) with respect to each individual Revolving Lender,
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Lender's Revolving
Loans plus its Participation Interests in outstanding LC Obligations plus its
(other than the Swingline Lender's) Participation Interests in outstanding
Swingline Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment
Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
account party for each Additional Letter of Credit shall be the Borrower.

            (c)   Method of Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower shall
give the Administrative Agent notice substantially in the form of Exhibit A-3
hereto (a "Letter of Credit Request") of the requested issuance or amendment of
a Letter of Credit prior to 1:00 P.M. (Chicago time) on the proposed date of the
issuance or amendment of Trade Letters of Credit (which shall be a Business Day)
and at least three Business Days before the proposed date of issuance or
extension of Standby Letters of Credit (which shall be a Business Day) (or such
shorter period as may be agreed by the applicable Issuing Lender in any
particular instance). In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a
Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Request shall specify in form and detail
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent: (i) the proposed issuance
date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the
amount thereof; (iii) the expiry date thereof; (iv) the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in
case of any drawing thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be
presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such
other matters as the Administrative Agent may require. In the case of a request
for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
Request shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent: (i) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (ii) the proposed
date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of
the proposed amendment; and (iv) such other matters as the Administrative Agent
may require. If requested by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall also
submit a letter of credit application on the Administrative Agent's standard
form in connection with any request for a letter of credit. The extension or
renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be an issuance of such Letter
of Credit. Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph with respect to
Evergreen Letters of Credit, no Letter of Credit shall have a term of more than
one year or shall have a term extending or be extendible beyond the fifth
Business Day before the Revolving Termination Date.

            If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit
Request, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
agree to induce an Issuing Lender to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic
renewal provisions (each, an "Evergreen Letter of Credit"); provided that any
such Evergreen Letter of Credit must permit the Issuing Lender to prevent any
such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date
of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary
thereof not later than a day (the "Nonrenewal Notice Date") in each such

                                     - 48 -
<PAGE>

twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is
issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower
shall not be required to make a specific request to the Administrative Agent for
any such renewal. Once an Evergreen Letter of Credit has been issued, the
Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the
Issuing Lender to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to a
date not later than the Revolving Termination Date; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall not permit any such renewal if (i) the Issuing Lender
would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its
renewed form under the terms hereof or (ii) it has received notice (which may be
by telephone or in writing) on or before the Business Day immediately preceding
the Nonrenewal Notice Date (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Required
Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or (B) from the
Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender or the Borrower that one or more of
the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Issuing Lender
shall have no obligation to permit the renewal of any Evergreen Letter of Credit
at any time.

            Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment
to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the
beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Lender will also deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or
amendment.

            (d)   Conditions to Issuance of Additional Letters of Credit. The
issuance by the Administrative Agent of an LC Support Agreement to induce an
Issuing Lender to issue each Additional Letter of Credit shall, in addition to
the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02, be subject to the conditions
precedent that (i) such Letter of Credit shall be reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Borrower shall have
executed and delivered such other instruments and agreements relating to such
Letter of Credit as the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably requested,
(iii) on the date of (and after giving effect to) such issuance that (A) the
aggregate amount of all LC Obligations will not exceed the LC Committed Amount
and (B) the aggregate Revolving Outstandings will not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Commitments and (iv) the Issuing Lender shall not have
been notified by the Administrative Agent that any condition specified in
Section 4.02(b) or (c) is not satisfied on the date such Additional Letter of
Credit is to be issued. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
2.05, the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation hereunder to
issue any LC Support Agreement if: (i) any order, judgment or decree of any
Governmental Authority shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the
Administrative Agent from issuing such LC Support Agreement, or any requirement
of Law applicable to the Administrative Agent or any request or directive
(whether or not having a force of Law) from any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent shall prohibit, or request that the
Administrative Agent refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
or such LC Support Agreement in particular or shall impose upon the
Administrative Agent with respect to such LC Support Agreement any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which the Administrative Agent is not
otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall
impose upon the Administrative Agent any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense
which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Administrative Agent
in good faith deems material to it; or (ii) the issuance of such LC Support
Agreement shall violate any applicable general policies of the Administrative
Agent.

            (e)   Purchase and Sale of Letter of Credit Participations. Upon the
issuance by an Issuing Lender of an Additional Letter of Credit, the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed, without further action by any party
hereto, to have sold to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall
be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from
the Administrative Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
Participation Interest in the LC Support Agreement obligations in respect of
such Additional Letter of Credit and the related LC Obligations in the
proportion

                                     - 49 -
<PAGE>

its Revolving Commitment Percentage bears to the Revolving Committed Amount
(although any fronting fee payable under Section 2.11 shall be payable directly
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender,
and the Lenders (other than such Issuing Lender) shall have no right to receive
any portion of any such fronting fee) and any security therefor or guaranty
pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Revolving Commitments pursuant to
Section 10.06, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the Participation
Interests in all outstanding LC Support Agreements to reflect the adjusted
Revolving Commitments of the assigning and assignee Lenders or of all Lenders
having Revolving Commitments, as the case may be.

            (f)   Duties of Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent to
Revolving Lenders; Reliance. In determining whether to pay under any Letter of
Credit or LC Support Agreement, the relevant Issuing Lender or Administrative
Agent as applicable shall not have any obligation relative to the Revolving
Lenders participating in such Letter of Credit or any LC Support Agreement other
than to determine that any document or documents required to be delivered under
a Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they substantially comply on
their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or
omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent as applicable under or in
connection with any LC Support Agreement or Letter of Credit shall not create
for the Issuing Lender or Administrative Agent as applicable any resulting
liability if taken or omitted in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Each Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent as
applicable shall be entitled (but not obligated) to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, on the representation and warranty by the Borrower set
forth in the last sentence of Section 4.02 to establish whether the conditions
specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 4.02 are met in connection with
any issuance or extension of an LC Support Agreement or a Letter of Credit. Each
Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent as applicable shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon advice and statements of
legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by such
Issuing Lender or Administrative Agent as applicable and upon any Letter of
Credit, LC support Agreement draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopier, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it in good
faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the
proper Person or Persons, and may accept documents that appear on their face to
be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary unless the beneficiary and the Borrower
shall have notified such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent as
applicable that such documents do not comply with the terms and conditions of
the Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent shall be
fully justified in refusing to take any action requested of it under this
Section 2.05 in respect of any Letter of Credit or any LC Support Agreement
unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required
Revolving Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Revolving Lenders against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take, or omitting or continuing to omit, any such action.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.05, each Issuing Lender
and the Administrative Agent and shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Section 2.05 in respect of any
LC Support Agreement or Letter of Credit or in accordance with a request of the
Required Revolving Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant hereto shall be binding upon all Revolving Lenders and all future
holders of participations in such LC Support Agreement or Letter of Credit.

            (g)   Reimbursement Obligations. The Borrower shall be irrevocably
and unconditionally obligated forthwith to reimburse each Issuing Lender for any
amounts paid by such Issuing Lender upon any drawing under any Existing Letter
of Credit and reimburse the Administrative Agent upon any payment made by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to an LC Support Agreement, together with any and
all reasonable charges and expenses which the Issuing Lender or Administrative
Agent respectively may pay or incur relative to such drawing or payment and
interest on the amount

                                     - 50 -
<PAGE>

drawn or paid at the rate applicable to Revolving Base Rate Loans for each day
from and including the date such amount is drawn or paid to but excluding the
date such reimbursement payment is due and payable. Such reimbursement payment
shall be due and payable (i) at or before 2:00 P.M. (Chicago time or the
relevant local time, as applicable) on the third Business Day after the date the
Issuing Lender or Administrative Agent (as the case may be) notifies the
Borrower of such drawing or payment; provided that no payment otherwise required
by this sentence to be made by the Borrower at or before 2:00 P.M. (Chicago time
or the relevant local time, as applicable) on any day shall be overdue hereunder
if arrangements for such payment satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Lender
or the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, shall have been made
by the Borrower at or before 2:00 P.M. (Chicago time or the relevant local time,
as applicable) on such day and such payment is actually made at or before 3:00
P.M. (Chicago time or the relevant local time, as applicable) on such day. In
addition to the foregoing, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender and
Administrative Agent interest, payable on demand, on any and all amounts not
paid by the Borrower to the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
applicable) when due under this subsection (g), for each day from and including
the date when such amount becomes due to but excluding the date such amount is
paid in full, whether before or after judgment, at a rate per annum equal to the
sum of 2.00% plus the rate applicable to Revolving Base Rate Loans for such day.
Subject to the satisfaction of all applicable conditions set forth in Article
IV, the Borrower may, at its option, utilize the Swingline Commitment or the
Revolving Commitments, or make other arrangements for payment satisfactory to
the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent, (as applicable) for the
reimbursement of all LC Disbursements as required by this subsection (g). Each
reimbursement payment to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (g)
shall be made to the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent (as applicable)
in Federal or other funds immediately available to it at its address referred to
in Section 10.01.

            (h)   Obligations of Revolving Lenders to Reimburse Issuing Lender
and the Administrative Agent for Unpaid LC Disbursements. If the Borrower shall
not have reimbursed an Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case
may be) in full for any LC Disbursement as required pursuant to subsection (g)
of this Section 2.05, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Revolving Lender, (other than the relevant Issuing Lender), and each such
Revolving Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of such Issuing Lender; or for itself as the case may be,
such Revolving Lender's pro-rata share of such unreimbursed LC Disbursement
(each such Lender's pro rata share of such LC Disbursement determined by the
proportion its Revolving Commitment Percentage bears to the aggregate Revolving
Committed Amount) in Dollars in Federal or other immediately available funds.
Such payment from the Revolving Lender shall be due (i) at or before 1:00 P.M.
(Chicago time) on the date the Administrative Agent so notifies a Revolving
Lender, if such notice is given at or before 10:00 A.M. (Chicago time) on such
date or (ii) at or before 10:00 A.M. (Chicago time) on the next succeeding
Business Day, together with interest on such amount for each day from and
including the date of such drawing to but excluding the day such payment is due
from such Revolving Lender at the Federal Funds Rate for such day (which funds,
in the case of a failure to reimburse an Issuing Lender under an Existing Letter
of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable
Issuing Lender). The failure of any Revolving Lender to make available to the
Administrative Agent its pro-rata share of any unreimbursed LC Disbursement
shall not relieve any other Revolving Lender of its obligation hereunder to make
available to the Administrative Agent its pro-rata share of any payment made
under any Letter of Credit or LC Support Agreement (as applicable) on the date
required, as specified above, but no such Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent such
other Lender's pro-rata share of any such payment. Upon payment in full of all
amounts payable by a Lender under this subsection (h), such Lender shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent as
applicable against the Borrower to the extent of such Lender's pro-rata share of
the related LC Obligation so paid (including interest accrued thereon). If any
Revolving Lender fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it

                                     - 51 -
<PAGE>

pursuant to this subsection (h) on the date on which such payment is due,
interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation to make such payment, for each
day from and including the date such payment became due to but excluding the
date such Lender makes such payment, whether before or after judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) for each day from the date such payment is due to the
third succeeding Business Day, inclusive, the Federal Funds Rate for such day as
determined by the relevant Issuing Lender and (ii) for each day thereafter, the
sum of 2.00% plus the rate applicable to its Revolving Base Rate Loans for such
day. Any payment made by any Lender after 3:00 P.M. on any Business Day shall be
deemed for purposes of the preceding sentence to have been made on the next
succeeding Business Day.

            (i)   Obligations in Respect of Letters of Credit Unconditional. The
obligations of the Borrower under Section 2.05(g) above shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including,
without limitation, the following circumstances:

                  (i)   any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
      any LC Support Agreement, or any Letter of Credit or any document related
      hereto or thereto;

                  (ii)  any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
      from all or any of the provisions of this Agreement, any LC Support
      Agreement, or any Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or
      thereto, in each case consented to by the Borrower;

                  (iii) the use which may be made of the Letter of Credit by, or
      any acts or omission of, a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any
      Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting);

                  (iv)  the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
      rights that the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary of a
      Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting),
      the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether
      in connection with this Agreement, any LC Support Agreement or any Letter
      of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto or any unrelated
      transaction;

                  (v)   any statement or any other document presented under an
      LC Support Agreement or a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
      fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue
      or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever;

                  (vi)  payment under a Letter of Credit against presentation to
      an Issuing Lender of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the
      terms of such Letter of Credit; provided that the relevant Issuing
      Lender's determination that documents presented under such Letter of
      Credit comply with the terms thereof shall not have constituted gross
      negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender; or

                  (vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by
      the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any other Person or any
      other event or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions
      of this subsection (vii), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
      Borrower's obligations hereunder.

            (j)   Designation of Subsidiaries as Account Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, an LC
Support Agreement or Letter of Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement
to the effect that such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of a
Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided that notwithstanding such statement, the
Borrower shall be the actual account party

                                     - 52 -
<PAGE>

for all purposes of this Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement
shall not affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect
to such Letter of Credit.

            (k)   Modification and Extension. The issuance of any supplement,
restatement, modification, amendment, renewal, or extensions to any LC Support
Agreement or Letter of Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all
respects the same as a Credit Extension hereunder.

            (l)   Uniform Customs and Practices. Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower when an LC Support Agreement
is issued in support of a Letter of Credit (including any such agreement
applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the "International
Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of International Banking Law
& Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of
issuance) shall apply to each Standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of
the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently
published by the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of
issuance (including the ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking
Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single currency
(euro)) shall apply to each Trade Letter of Credit.

            (m)   Responsibility of Issuing Lenders. It is expressly understood
and agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lenders and Administrative Agent
hereunder to the Revolving Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and that each Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have
been satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge that any such
condition precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however, that nothing set
forth in this Section 2.05 shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any
Revolving Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent
any amounts made available by such Revolving Lender to such Issuing Lender and
the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.05 in the event that it is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to
a Letter of Credit or an LC Support Agreement constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender or Administrative Agent (as
applicable).

            (n)   Conflict with LC Documents. In the event of any conflict
between this Agreement and any LC Document, this Agreement shall govern.

            (o)   Indemnification of Issuing Lenders and the Administrative
Agent.

                  (i)   In addition to its other obligations under this
      Agreement, the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save
      the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender harmless from and against
      any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges
      and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that the
      Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a
      consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any LC Support
      Agreement or Letter of Credit as applicable or (B) the failure of the
      Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under an LC
      Support Agreement or Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
      whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto
      government or Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein
      called "Government Acts").

                  (ii)  As between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or
      each Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts or
      omissions of or the misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary
      thereof. The Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender shall not be
      responsible for: (A) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
      genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in
      connection with the application for and issuance of any LC Support
      Agreement or Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in
      any or all respects

                                     - 53 -
<PAGE>

      invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) the validity
      or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting
      to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
      thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be
      invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) failure of the beneficiary of a
      Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions required in order to draw
      upon a Letter of Credit; (D) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
      transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex
      or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (E) errors in
      interpretation of technical terms; (F) any loss or delay in the
      transmission or otherwise of any documents required in order to make a
      drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (G) any
      consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Administrative
      Agent or Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, any Government
      Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of
      the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder.

                  (iii) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of
      the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted
      by the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Lender, under or in connection
      with any LC Support Agreement or Letter of Credit or the related
      certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the
      Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to
      the Borrower or any other Credit Party other than for gross negligence,
      bad faith or willful misconduct. It is the intention of the parties that
      this Agreement shall be construed and applied to protect and indemnify the
      Administrative Agent or Issuing Lenders against any and all risks involved
      in the issuance of any LC Support Agreement or Letter of Credit, all of
      which risks are hereby assumed by the Credit Parties, including, without
      limitation, any and all risks, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
      present or future Government Acts. The Administrative Agent or Issuing
      Lenders shall not, in any way, be liable for any failure by the
      Administrative Agent or Issuing Lenders or anyone else to pay any drawing
      under any LC Support Agreement or Letter of Credit as a result of any
      Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of the Issuing
      Lenders.

                  (iv)  Nothing in this subsection (o) is intended to limit the
      reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.05.
      The obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (o) shall survive
      the termination of this Agreement. No act or omission of any current or
      prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way affect or impair
      the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender to enforce
      any right, power or benefit under this Agreement.

                  (v)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
      this subsection (o), the Borrower shall not have any obligation to
      indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender in respect of any
      liability to the extent incurred by the Administrative Agent or such
      Issuing Lender arising solely out of the gross negligence, bad faith, or
      willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender,
      respectively, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing
      in this Agreement shall relieve Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender
      of any liability to the Borrower in respect of any action taken by the
      Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender which action constitutes gross
      negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or
      such Issuing Lender or a violation of the UCP or Uniform Commercial Code,
      as applicable, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

            (p)   Cash Collateral. If the Borrower is required pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement to Cash Collateralize any LC Obligations, the Borrower
shall deposit in an account (which may be an LC Cash Collateral Account under
the Security Agreement) with the Collateral Agent an amount in Dollars in cash
equal to 105% of such LC Obligations. Such deposit shall be held by the
Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the LC
Obligations. The Collateral

                                     - 54 -
s
<PAGE>

Agent shall have exclusive control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal,
over each collateral account referred to in this subsection (p). The Collateral
Agent will, at the request of the Borrower, invest amounts deposited in such
account in Cash Equivalents; provided, however, that (i) the Collateral Agent
shall not be required to make any investment that, in its sole judgment, would
require or cause the Collateral Agent to be in, or would result in any,
violation of any Law, (ii) such Cash Equivalents shall be subjected to a first
priority perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent and (iii)
if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the selection of
such Cash Equivalents shall be in the sole discretion of the Collateral Agent.
The Borrower shall indemnify the Collateral Agent for any losses relating to
such investments in Cash Equivalents. Other than any interest or profits earned
on such investments, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits,
if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Lenders immediately for drawings under the applicable Letters of Credit and
reimburse the Administrative Agent immediately for payments under the applicable
LC Support Agreement and, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, to
satisfy the LC Obligations of the Borrower. If the Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of an Event of
Default, such amount together with any interest or profits earned thereon (to
the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within
three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If
the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder
pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.09(b)(i), such amount together with any
interest or profits earned thereon (to the extent not applied as aforesaid)
shall be returned to the Borrower upon demand; provided that, after giving
effect to the return, (i) the aggregate Revolving Outstandings would not exceed
the Revolving Committed Amount and (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing. If the Borrower is required to deposit an
amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.09(b) (iii), (iv),
(v), (vi), or (vii), interest or profits thereon (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower after the full amount of such
deposit has been applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender
for drawings under Letters of Credit and the Administrative Agent for payments
under LC Support Agreements. The Borrower hereby pledges and assigns to the
Collateral Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Finance Parties, each
cash collateral account established by it hereunder (and all monies and
investments held therein) to secure its Finance Obligations.

            (q)   Resignation or Removal of an Issuing Lender. An Issuing Lender
may resign at any time by giving 60 days' notice to the Administrative Agent,
the Revolving Lenders and the Borrower; provided, however, that such resignation
shall not affect the status of any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such
resigning Issuing Lender as set forth in subsection (r) below. Upon any such
resignation, the Borrower shall (within 60 days after such notice of
resignation) either appoint a successor, or terminate the unutilized LC
Commitment of such Issuing Lender; provided, however, that, if the Borrower
elects to terminate such unutilized LC Commitment, the Borrower may at any time
thereafter that the Revolving Commitments are in effect reinstate such LC
Commitment in connection with the appointment of another Issuing Lender. Subject
to subsection (r) below, upon the acceptance of any appointment as an Issuing
Lender hereunder by a successor Issuing Lender, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the interests, rights and obligations of the retiring
Issuing Lender and the retiring Issuing Lender shall be discharged from its
obligations to issue Additional Letters of Credit hereunder. The acceptance of
any appointment as Issuing Lender hereunder by a successor Issuing Lender shall
be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from
and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such successor shall be a
party hereto and have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under
this Agreement and the other Senior Finance Documents, and (ii) references
herein and in the other Senior Finance Documents to the "Issuing Lender" shall
be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to
such successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require.

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

            (r)   Rights with Respect to Outstanding Letters of Credit. After
the resignation of an Issuing Lender hereunder the retiring Issuing Lender shall
remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations
of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement and the other Senior Finance Documents
with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but
shall not be required to issue Additional Letters of Credit.

            (s)   Reporting. Each Issuing Lender will report in writing to the
Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each week, the aggregate
amount of the face amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as
of the last Business Day of the preceding week, (ii) on or prior to each
Business Day on which such Issuing Lender expects to issue, amend, renew or
extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance or amendment, and the
aggregate amount of the face amount of Letters of Credit to be issued, amended,
renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (and such Issuing Lender shall advise the
Administrative Agent on such Business Day whether such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension occurred and whether the amount thereof changed), (iii) on
each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender makes any LC Disbursement, the
date of such LC Disbursement and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on
any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement
required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Lender on such day, the date of such
failure, the Borrower and the amount, of such LC Disbursement.

            SECTION 2.06 INTEREST.

            (a)   Rate Options Applicable to Loans. Each Borrowing made prior to
the Syndication Date shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans or (except in the
case of Swingline Loans, which shall be made and maintained as Base Rate Loans)
Eurodollar Loans with a one-month Interest Period (ending on the same date), as
the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.02. Each Borrowing made on or
after the Syndication Date shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans or (except in
the case of Swingline Loans, which shall be made and maintained as Base Rate
Loans) Eurodollar Loans, as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.02.
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided,
however, that the Borrower may not request any Borrowing that, if made, would
result in an aggregate of more than 15 separate Groups of Eurodollar Loans being
outstanding hereunder at any one time. For this purpose, Loans having different
Interest Periods, regardless of whether commencing on the same date, shall be
considered separate Groups.

            (b)   Base Rate Loans. Each Loan of a Class which is made as, or
converted into, a Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made as, or
converted into, a Base Rate Loan until it becomes due or is converted into a
Loan of any other Type, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day
plus the then Applicable Margin. Such interest shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date and, with respect to the principal amount of any Base
Rate Loan converted to a Eurodollar Loan, on the date such Base Rate Loan is so
converted.

            (c)   Eurodollar Loans. Each Eurodollar Loan of a Class shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the
Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
applicable Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period plus
the then Applicable Margin. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on each Interest Payment Date.

            (d)   Determination and Notice of Interest Rates. The Administrative
Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
participating Lenders of each rate of interest so determined, and its

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Any
such notice shall, without the necessity of the Administrative Agent so stating
in such notice, be subject to the provisions of the definition of "Applicable
Margin" providing for adjustments in the Applicable Margin from time to time.
When during an Interest Period any event occurs that causes an adjustment in the
Applicable Margin applicable to Loans to which such Interest Period is
applicable, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower
and the Lenders of such event and the adjusted rate of interest so determined
for such Loans, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error.

            (e)   Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a) and/or (f), the overdue
principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest on the Loans
and any other overdue amounts owing herein or under the other Senior Finance
Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate equal to
(i) in the case of principal of any Loan, the rate otherwise applicable to such
Loan during such period pursuant to this Section 2.06 plus 2.00%, (ii) in the
case of interest on any Loan the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Loans
of such Class on such day plus 2.00% and (iii) in the case of any other amount,
if expressly provided for herein, at the rate so provided and otherwise at the
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Base Rate Loans plus 2.00%.

            SECTION 2.07 EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

            (a)   Continuation and Conversion Options. The Loans included in
each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate allowed by
Section 2.06 and as specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of
Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower shall have the option to elect to change or
continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each
case to the provisions of Article III and subsection 2.07(d)), as follows:

                  (i)   if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may
      elect pursuant to a Notice of Extension/Conversion to convert such Loans
      to Eurodollar Loans as of any Business Day; and

                  (ii)  if such Loans are Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower may
      elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or elect to continue such
      Loans as Eurodollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, subject to
      Section 3.05 in the case of any such conversion or continuation effective
      on any day other than the last day of the then current Interest Period
      applicable to such Loans.

Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice, substantially in the
form of Exhibit A-2 hereto (a "Notice of Extension/Conversion") or by telephone
promptly confirmed by a Notice of Extension/Conversion, which notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower, to the Administrative Agent not later
than 12:00 Noon on the second Business Day before the conversion or continuation
selected in such notice is to be effective. A Notice of Extension/Conversion
may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided that (i) such portion is
allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to
which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply,
are each $1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $100,000.

            (b)   Contents of Notice of Extension/Conversion. Each Notice of
Extension/Conversion shall specify:

                  (i)   the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such
      notice applies;

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

                  (ii)  the date on which the conversion or continuation
      selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the
      applicable clause of subsection 2.07(a) above;

                  (iii) if the Loans comprising such Group are to be converted,
      the new Type of Loans and, if the Loans being converted are to be
      Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the next succeeding Interest Period
      applicable thereto; and

                  (iv)  if such Loans are to be continued as Eurodollar Loans
      for an additional Interest Period, the duration of such additional
      Interest Period.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
comply with the provisions of the definitions of the term "Interest Period". If
no Notice of Extension/Conversion is timely received prior to the end of an
Interest Period for any Group of Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed
to have elected that such Group be converted to Base Rate Loans as of the last
day of such Interest Period.

            (c)   Notification to Lenders. Upon receipt of a Notice of
Extension/Conversion (written or telephonic as set forth above) from the
Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.07(a) above, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof.

            (d)   Limitation on Conversion/Continuation Options. The Borrower
shall not be entitled to elect to convert any Loans to, or continue any Loans
for an additional Interest Period as, Eurodollar Loans if (i) the aggregate
principal amount of any Group of Eurodollar Loans created or continued as a
result of such election would be less than $1,000,000 or (ii) an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing when the Borrower delivers notice
of such election to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall not be entitled
to elect to continue any Eurodollar Loans for an Interest Period in excess of
one month, if a Default shall have occurred and be continuing when the Borrower
delivers notice of such election to the Administrative Agent.

            (e)   Accrued Interest. Accrued interest on a Loan (or portion
thereof) being extended or converted shall be paid by the Borrower (i) with
respect to any Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar Loan, on the last
day of the first fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending on or after the date of
conversion and (ii) otherwise, on the date of extension or conversion.

            SECTION 2.08 MATURITY OF LOANS.

            (a)   Maturity of Revolving Loans. The Revolving Loans shall mature
on the Revolving Termination Date, and any Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and
LC Obligations then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon and fees
in respect thereof) shall be due and payable on such date.

            (b)   Scheduled Amortization of Term B Loan. The Borrower shall
repay, and there shall become due and payable (together with accrued interest
thereon) on each Principal Amortization Payment Date, (i) 1/4 of 1% of the
aggregate initial principal amount of the Term B Loan, in the case of each of
the first 24 Principal Amortization Payment Dates and (ii) thereafter, 23.5% of
the aggregate initial principal amount of the Term B Loan, in the case of the
four final Principal Amortization Dates, and in each case the Term B Loans of
each class of each Lender shall be ratably repaid.

            SECTION 2.09 PREPAYMENTS.

            (a)   Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right
voluntarily to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time, subject to
Section 3.05 but otherwise without premium or

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

penalty; provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment of Loans of any
Class shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, (ii) the Borrower shall have given
prior written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by
written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent, (A) in the case of any
Revolving Loan which is a Base Rate Loan or any Swingline Loan, by 12 Noon on
the date of prepayment and (B), in the case of any other Loan, by 12 Noon at
least two Business Days prior to the date of prepayment and (iii) voluntary
prepayments of Term Loans under this Section 2.09(a) shall be applied ratably to
the remaining Principal Amortization Payments thereof. Each notice of prepayment
shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount remaining and amount to
be prepaid, whether the Loan to be prepaid is a Revolving Loan, Term B Loan or
Swingline Loan, whether the Loan to be prepaid is a Eurodollar Loan or a Base
Rate Loan and, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the Interest Period of such
Loan. Each notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable and shall commit the
Borrower to prepay such Loan by the amount, and on the date stated therein.
Subject to the foregoing, amounts prepaid under this Section 2.09(a) shall be
applied as the Borrower may elect; provided that if the Borrower fails to
specify the application of a voluntary prepayment, then such prepayment shall be
applied first to Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof (without a permanent
reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount), then to Swingline Loans to the
full extent thereof (without a permanent reduction in the Revolving Committed
Amount), then to Term B Loans (ratably to the remaining Principal Amortization
Payments thereof), in each case first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar
Loans of the applicable Class in direct order of Interest Period maturity. All
prepayments under this Section 2.09(a) shall be accompanied by accrued interest
on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of payment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Borrower may elect to cause all or a portion of any such
prepayment of Term B Loans to be applied to the remaining Principal Amortization
Payments thereof in direct order of maturity.

            (b)   Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i)   Revolving Committed Amount. If on any date the aggregate
      Revolving Outstandings exceed the Revolving Committed Amount, the Borrower
      shall repay, and there shall become due and payable (together with accrued
      interest thereon), on such date an aggregate principal amount of Swingline
      Loans equal to such excess. If the outstanding Swingline Loans have been
      repaid in full, the Borrower shall prepay, and there shall become due and
      payable (together with accrued interest thereon), Revolving Loans in such
      amounts as are necessary so that, after giving effect to the repayment of
      the Swingline Loans and the repayment of Revolving Loans, the aggregate
      Revolving Outstandings do not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. If
      the outstanding Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans have been repaid in
      full, the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize LC Obligations so that, after
      giving effect to the repayment of Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans and
      the Cash Collateralization of LC Obligations pursuant to this subsection
      (i), the aggregate Revolving Outstandings do not exceed the Revolving
      Committed Amount. In determining the aggregate Revolving Outstandings for
      purposes of this subsection (i), LC Obligations shall be reduced to the
      extent that they are Cash Collateralized as contemplated by this
      subsection (i). Each prepayment of Revolving Loans required pursuant to
      this subsection (i) shall be applied ratably among outstanding Revolving
      Loans based on the respective amounts of principal then outstanding. Each
      Cash Collateralization of LC Obligations required by this subsection (i)
      shall be applied ratably among LC Obligations based on the respective
      amounts thereof then outstanding.

                  (ii)  Excess Cash Flow. Within 120 days after the end of each
      fiscal year of the Borrower (commencing with the fiscal year ending
      December 31, 2004, but with respect to such year, from the Closing Date
      only), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize or
      pay the LC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to (A) 75% of the
      Excess Cash Flow for such prior fiscal year if the Leverage Ratio as of
      the last day of such prior fiscal

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

      year was equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0, (B) 50% of the Excess Cash
      Flow for such prior fiscal year, if the Leverage Ratio as of the last day
      of such prior fiscal year was less than 3.0 to 1.0 but equal to or greater
      than 2.0 to 1.0 or (C) 25% of the Excess Cash Flow for the prior fiscal
      year, if the Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such prior fiscal year
      was less than 2.0 to 1.0. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the date of
      such prepayment, a payment in respect of the Junior Debentures would not
      be permitted pursuant to Section 7.08 (d) below, the Borrower shall prepay
      the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize or pay the LC Obligations in an
      aggregate amount equal to 75% of the Excess Cash Flow for such prior
      fiscal year.

                  (iii) Asset Dispositions, Casualties and Condemnations, etc.
      Within five Business Days after receipt by any Group Company of proceeds
      from any Asset Disposition (other than any Excluded Asset Disposition),
      Casualty or Condemnation, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash
      Collateralize or pay the LC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to
      100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Disposition, Casualty or
      Condemnation, as applicable

                  (iv)  Debt Issuances. Within five Business Days after receipt
      by any Group Company of proceeds from any Debt Issuance (other than such
      Debt Issuance permitted pursuant to Section 7.01 of this Agreement), the
      Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the LC
      Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds
      of such Debt Issuance.

                  (v)   Equity Issuances. Within five Business Days after
      receipt by any Group Company of proceeds from any Equity Issuance (other
      than any Excluded Equity Issuance), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
      and/or Cash Collateralize the LC Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
      to (A) 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance if the
      Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the fiscal quarter on a Pro-Forma
      Basis (as confirmed by the delivery of the Pro-Forma Compliance
      Certificate) of the Borrower ending on or most recently preceding the date
      of the receipt of such proceeds was equal to or greater than 3.5 to 1.0,
      (B) 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance, if the Leverage
      Ratio as of the last day of the fiscal quarter on a Pro-Forma Basis (as
      confirmed by the delivery of the Pro-Forma Compliance Certificate) of the
      Borrower ending on or most recently preceding the date of the receipt of
      such proceeds was less than 3.5 to 1.0 but equal to or greater than 2.5 to
      1.0, and (C) 25% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Equity Issuance, if the
      Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the fiscal year of the Borrower
      ending on or most recently preceding the date of the receipt of such
      proceeds was less than 2.5 to 1.0, and in each case, Holdings shall have
      delivered to the Administrative Agent a Pro-Forma Compliance Certificate
      in connection therewith.

                  (vi)  Payments in Respect of Subordinated Debt. Immediately
      upon receipt by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any amount
      pursuant to the subordination provision of any Debt of Holdings or any of
      its Subsidiaries that is subordinate to the Senior Obligations, all
      proceeds thereof shall be applied as set forth in subsection (vii)(B)
      below.

                  (vii) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts
      required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.09(b) shall be applied as
      follows:

                        (A)   with respect to all amounts paid pursuant to
            Section 2.09(b)(i) in the order provided in such Section; and

                        (B)   with respect to all amounts paid pursuant to
            Section 2.09(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) (1) first, to the Term
            B Loans (ratably to the remaining Principal

                                      -60-

<PAGE>

            Amortization Payments thereof, provided that the Borrower may elect
            to cause all or a portion of such prepayment of Term B Loans to be
            applied to the remaining Principal Amortization Payments thereof in
            direct order of maturity, due in the twelve month period commencing
            on the date of prepayment) and (2) second, (x) to the Revolving
            Loans (with a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Committed
            Amount pursuant to Section 2.10(b)), (y) then to Swingline Loans
            (with a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount
            and the Swingline Committed Amount pursuant to Section 2.10(b)), and
            (z) then to Cash Collateralize LC Obligations.

                  (viii) Order of Applications. All amounts allocated to
      Revolving Outstandings as provided in this Section 2.09(b) shall be
      applied, first, to Swingline Loans, second, after all Swingline Loans have
      been repaid, to Revolving Loans, and third, after all Revolving Loans have
      been repaid, to Cash Collateralize or pay the LC Obligations; provided
      that any balance of such amounts remaining after all Revolving Loans have
      been repaid and, if applicable, all LC Obligations have been Cash
      Collateralized shall be applied to the Term B Loans in each case ratably
      to the remaining Principal Amortization Payments thereof. Within the
      parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments of Revolving
      Loans and Term B Loans shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then,
      subject to subsection (ix) below, to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of
      Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.09(b)
      shall be subject to Section 3.05. All prepayments under this Section
      2.09(b) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount
      being prepaid to the date of payment.

                  (ix)  Prepayment Accounts. Amounts to be applied as provided
      in subsection (vii) above to the prepayment of Revolving Loans or Term B
      Loans shall be applied first to reduce outstanding Base Rate Loans of such
      Class. Any amounts remaining after each such application shall, at the
      option of the Borrower, be applied to prepay Eurodollar Loans of such
      Class immediately and/or shall be deposited in a separate Prepayment
      Account (as defined below) for the Loans of such Class. The Administrative
      Agent shall apply any cash deposited in the Prepayment Account for any
      Class of Loans, upon withdrawal by the Collateral Agent, to prepay
      Eurodollar Loans of such Class on the last day of their respective
      Interest Periods (or, at the direction of the Borrower, on any earlier
      date) until all outstanding Loans of such Class have been prepaid or until
      all the allocable cash on deposit in the Prepayment Account for such Class
      has been exhausted. Concurrently with such application, the aggregate
      amount of any interest or profits earned on the amount so applied shall be
      withdrawn by the Collateral Agent and paid to the order of the Borrower.
      For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Prepayment Account" for any
      Class of Loans shall mean an account (which may include the Prepayment
      Account established under the Security Agreement) established by the
      Borrower with the Collateral Agent and over which the Collateral Agent
      shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
      of withdrawal for application in accordance with this subsection (ix). The
      Collateral Agent will, at the request of the Borrower, invest amounts on
      deposit in the Prepayment Account for any Class of Loans in Cash
      Equivalents that mature prior to the last day of the applicable Interest
      Periods of the Eurodollar Loans of such Class to be prepaid; provided,
      however, that (i) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to make any
      investment that, in its sole judgment, would require or cause the
      Collateral Agent to be in, or would result in any, violation of any Law,
      (ii) such Cash Equivalents shall be subjected to a first priority
      perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent and (iii) if
      any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the selection
      of such Cash Equivalents shall be in the sole discretion of the Collateral
      Agent. The Borrower shall indemnify the Collateral Agent for any losses
      relating to such investments in Cash Equivalents so that the amount
      available to prepay Eurodollar Loans on the last day of the applicable
      Interest Periods is not less than the amount that would have been
      available had no investments been made pursuant thereto. Other than any

                                      -61-

<PAGE>

      interest or profits earned on such investments, the Prepayment Accounts
      shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on the investments
      in any Prepayment Account shall accumulate in such Prepayment Account and
      be paid to the Borrower as provided above. If the maturity of the Loans
      has been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.02, the Administrative Agent
      may, in its sole discretion, cause the Collateral Agent to withdraw
      amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Account for any Class of Loans and
      apply such funds to satisfy any of the Senior Obligations related to such
      Class of Loans.

                  (x)   Payments Cumulative. Except as otherwise expressly
      provided in this Section 2.09, payments required under any subsection or
      clause of this Section 2.09 are in addition to payments made or required
      under any other subsection or clause of this Section 2.09.

                  (xi)  Notice. The Borrower shall give to the Administrative
      Agent and the Lenders at least five Business Days' prior written or
      telecopy notice of each and every event or occurrence requiring a
      prepayment under Section 2.09(b)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi), including the
      amount of Net Cash Proceeds expected to be received therefrom and the
      expected schedule for receiving such proceeds; provided, however, that in
      the case of any prepayment event consisting of a Casualty or Condemnation,
      the Borrower shall give such notice within five Business Days after the
      occurrence of such event.

            SECTION 2.10 ADJUSTMENT OF COMMITMENTS.

            (a)   Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments (Pro-Rata).
The Borrower may from time to time permanently reduce or terminate the Revolving
Committed Amount in whole or in part (in minimum aggregate amounts of $1,000,000
or in integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the full
remaining amount of the then applicable Revolving Committed Amount)) upon two
Business Days' prior written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent;
provided, however, that no such termination or reduction shall be made which
would cause the Revolving Outstandings to exceed the Revolving Committed Amount
as so reduced unless, concurrently with such termination or reduction, the
Revolving Loans are repaid or, if no Revolving Loans are outstanding, the
Swingline Loans are repaid and, after the Swingline Loans have been paid in
full, the LC Obligations are Cash Collateralized to the extent necessary to
eliminate such excess. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
affected Lender of the receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.10(a). Any partial reduction of the
Revolving Committed Amount pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall be applied to
the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders of the applicable Class pro-rata based
upon their respective Revolving Commitment Percentages. The Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.11, on the date of each termination or reduction of the
Revolving Committed Amount, any fees accrued through the date of such
termination or reduction on the amount of the Revolving Committed Amount so
terminated or reduced.

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

            (b)   Mandatory Reductions.

                  On any date that any Revolving Loans are required to be
prepaid, Swingline Loans are required to be prepaid and/or LC Obligations are
required to be Cash Collateralized pursuant to the terms of Section 2.09(b),
(iv), (v) or (vi) (or would be so required if any Revolving Loans, Swingline
Loans or LC Obligations were outstanding), the Revolving Committed Amount shall
be automatically and permanently reduced by the total amount of such required
prepayments and cash collateral (and, in the event that the amount of any
payment referred to in Section 2.09(b), (iv), (v) or (vi) which is allocable to
the Revolving Outstandings exceeds the amount of all outstanding Revolving
Outstandings, the Revolving Committed Amount shall be further reduced by 100% of
such excess).

            (c)   Termination. The Revolving Commitments of the Lenders and the
LC Commitments of the Issuing Lenders shall terminate automatically on the
Revolving Termination Date. The Swingline Commitment of the Swingline Lender
shall terminate automatically on the Swingline Termination Date. The Term B
Commitments of the Lenders shall terminate automatically immediately after the
making of the Term B Loan on the Closing Date.

            (d)   Optional Termination of Commitments (Non-Pro-Rata). If (i) any
Lender has demanded compensation or indemnification pursuant to Section 3.01 or
Section 3.04, (ii) the obligation of any Lender to make Eurodollar Loans has
been suspended pursuant to Section 3.02, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender
or (iv) any Lender has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver,
discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of Section 10.03 or any
other provision of any Senior Finance Document requires the consent of more than
the Required Lenders and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have
granted their consent, the Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event
of Default then exists, to (i) remove such Lender by terminating such Lender's
Commitment in full or (ii) replace such Lender by causing such Lender to assign
its Commitment to one or more existing Lenders or Eligible Assignees pursuant to
Section 10.06; provided, however, that if the Borrower elects to exercise such
right with respect to any Lender pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, it shall
be obligated to remove or replace, as the case may be, all Lenders that have
similar requests then outstanding for compensation pursuant to Section 3.01 or
3.04 or whose obligation to make Eurodollar Loans has been similarly suspended.
The replacement of a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) shall be effective
on the date of notice of such replacement to the Lenders through the
Administrative Agent (the "Replacement Date"), subject to the satisfaction of
the following conditions:

                  (i)   each replacement Lender and/or Eligible Assignee, and
      the Administrative Agent acting on behalf of each Lender subject to
      replacement, shall have satisfied the conditions to an Assignment and
      Acceptance set forth in Section 10.06(b) and, in connection therewith, the
      replacement Lender(s) and/or Eligible Assignee(s) shall pay:

                        (A)   to each Lender subject to replacement an amount
            equal in the aggregate to the sum of (x) the principal of, and all
            accrued but unpaid interest on, its outstanding Loans, (y) the
            amount of all LC Disbursements that have been funded by (and not
            reimbursed to) it under Section 2.05, together with all accrued but
            unpaid interest with respect thereto, and (z) all accrued but unpaid
            fees owing to it pursuant to Section 2.11; and

                        (B)   to the Issuing Lenders an amount equal to the
            aggregate amount owing by the replaced Lenders to the Issuing
            Lenders as reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.05, to the extent
            such amount was not theretofore funded by such replaced Lenders; and

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

                  (ii)  the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent
      for the account of each replaced Lender an amount equal to all obligations
      owing to such replaced Lenders by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
      and the other Senior Finance Documents (other than those obligations of
      the Borrower referred to in clause (i)(A) above).

            In the case of the removal of a Lender pursuant to this Section
2.10(d), upon (i) payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lender subject to such removal of an amount equal to the sum of
(A) the aggregate principal amount of all Loans and LC Obligations held by such
Lender and (B) all accrued interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Lender
hereunder, including, without limitation, all amounts payable by the Borrower to
such Lender under Article III or Sections 10.04 and 10.05, and (ii) provision by
the Borrower to the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Lender of appropriate
assurances and indemnities (which may include letters of credit) as each may
reasonably require with respect to any continuing obligation of such removed
Lender to purchase Participation Interests in any LC Obligations or Swingline
Loans then outstanding, such Lender shall, without any further consent or other
action by it, cease to constitute a Lender hereunder; provided that the
provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the provisions of
Article III and Sections 10.04 and 10.05) shall continue to govern the rights
and obligations of a removed Lender with respect to any Loans made, any Letters
of Credit issued or any other actions taken by such removed Lender while it was
a Lender.

            (e)   General. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section 2.11, on
the date of each termination or reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount, the
Commitment Fee accrued through the date of such termination or reduction on the
amount of the Revolving Committed Amount so terminated or reduced.

            SECTION 2.11 FEES.

            (a)   Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a fee (the "Commitment Fee") on
such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the daily Unused Revolving
Committed Amount, computed at a per annum rate for each day equal to 0.50%. The
Commitment Fee shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall be due and
payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December (and any date that the Revolving Committed Amount is reduced as
provided in Section 2.10(a) or (b) and the Revolving Termination Date for the
applicable Class) for the quarter or portion thereof ending on each such date,
beginning with the first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date.

            (b)   Letter of Credit Fees.

                  (i)   Letter of Credit Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a fee (the
      "Letter of Credit Fee") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage
      of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under each such
      Letter of Credit computed at a per annum rate for each day from the date
      of issuance to the date of expiration equal to the Applicable Margin for
      Letter of Credit Fees in effect from time to time. The Letter of Credit
      Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
      March, June, September and December for the immediately preceding quarter
      (or portion thereof), beginning with the first of such dates to occur
      after the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, and on the Revolving
      Termination Date.

                  (ii)  Fronting Fees. The Borrower shall pay directly to each
      Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each
      Letter of Credit, in an amount to be agreed between the Borrower and the
      relevant Issuing Lender, such fronting fee to be due and payable

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

      quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
      September and December, commencing with the first such date after the
      issuance of such Letter of Credit, and on the Revolving Termination Date.

                  (iii) Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the Letter of Credit
      Fee payable pursuant to clause (i) above and any fronting fees payable
      pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower promises to pay to the Issuing
      Lender for its own account without sharing by the other Lenders the letter
      of credit fronting and negotiation fees agreed to by the Borrower and the
      Issuing Lender from time to time and the customary charges from time to
      time of the Issuing Lender with respect to the issuance, amendment,
      transfer, administration, cancellation and conversion of, and drawings
      under, each Letter of Credit (collectively, the "Issuing Lender Fees").

                  (iv)  Computation of Certain Fees after Default. Upon the
      occurrence and during the continuance of a payment or insolvency Event of
      Default under Section 8.01(a) and/or (f) any overdue Letter of Credit Fee
      payable under subsection (i) above shall be computed at a rate per annum
      equal to the relevant "Applicable Margin for Letter of Credit Fee" as set
      forth in the applicable table in the definition of "Applicable Margin" in
      Section 1.01 hereof plus 2.00%.

            SECTION 2.12 PRO-RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent otherwise
provided herein:

            (a)   Loans. Each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal
of or interest on any Loan, each payment of fees (other than the Issuing Lender
Fees retained by an Issuing Lender for its own account and the administrative
fees retained by the Agents for their own account), each reduction of the
Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion or continuation of any Loan,
shall be allocated pro-rata among the relevant Lenders in accordance with the
respective Revolving Commitment Percentages and Term B Commitment Percentages,
as applicable, of such Lenders (or, if the Commitments of such Lenders have
expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts
of the outstanding Loans of the applicable Class and Participation Interests of
such Lenders); provided that, in the event any amount paid to any Lender
pursuant to this subsection (a) is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so paid to
such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is
returned by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent
receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but
excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal Funds Rate,
and thereafter, the Base Rate plus 2.00% per annum.

            (b)   Letters of Credit. Each payment of LC Obligations shall be
allocated to each Revolving Lender pro-rata in accordance with its Revolving
Commitment Percentage; provided that, if any Revolving Lender shall have failed
to pay its applicable pro-rata share of any LC Disbursement, then any amount to
which such Revolving Lender would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this
subsection (b) shall instead be payable to the Issuing Lender; provided,
further, that in the event any amount paid to any Revolving Lender pursuant to
this subsection (b) is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Issuing
Lender, each Revolving Lender shall, upon the request of the Issuing Lender,
repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender the
amount so paid to such Revolving Lender, with interest for the period commencing
on the date such payment is returned by the Issuing Lender until the date the
Issuing Lender receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the
period to but excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the
Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter, the Base Rate plus 2.00% per annum.

            SECTION 2.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS. The Lenders agree among themselves
that, except to the extent otherwise provided herein, if any Lender shall obtain
payment in respect of any Loan, unreimbursed LC Disbursements or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Agreement through the exercise of a
right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim
under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising
from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any
other means, in excess of its pro-rata share of such payment as provided for in
this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly pay in cash or purchase from the
other Lenders a participation in such Loans, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, and
other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to
time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in
accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this
Agreement; provided that nothing in this Section 2.13 shall impair the right of
any Lender to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have for
payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder.
The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained
by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien,
counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be
restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall,
by payment in cash or a repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return
its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest
payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been
rescinded or otherwise restored. Holdings and the Borrower agree that any Lender
so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim,
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of
such Loan, LC Obligation or other obligation in the amount of such
participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this
Section 2.13 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its
rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights
of the Lenders under this Section 2.13 to share in the benefits of any recovery
on such secured claim.

            SECTION 2.14 PAYMENTS; COMPUTATIONS.

            (a)   Payments by the Borrower. Each payment of principal of and
interest on Loans, LC Obligations and fees hereunder (other than fees payable
directly to the Issuing Lenders) shall be paid not later than 2:00 P.M. on the
date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available to the
Administrative Agent at the account designated by it by notice to the Borrower.
Each such payment shall be made irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or
defense to payment which might in the absence of this provision be asserted by
the Borrower or any Affiliate against any Agent or any Lender. Payments received
after 2:00 P.M. shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day.
The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payments under this Agreement,
specify to the Administrative Agent the Loan, Letters of Credit, fees or other
amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied
(and any such specified application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof,
the Administrative Agent shall, subject to Section 2.12, distribute such payment
to the Lenders in such manner as the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably
appropriate). The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to the
applicable Lenders on the date of receipt thereof, if such payment is received
prior to 2:00 P.M.; otherwise the Administrative Agent may, in its sole
discretion distribute such payment to the applicable Lenders on the date of
receipt thereof or on the immediately succeeding Business Day. Whenever any
payment hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date
for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless
such Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for
payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day. If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
thereon shall be payable for such extended time. The Borrower hereby authorizes
and directs each Agent to debit any account maintained by the Borrower for such
purpose with such Agent to pay

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

when due any amounts required to be paid from time to time under this Agreement
as directed at such time(s) by the Borrower.

            (b)   Distributions by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice (written or telephonic) from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount
equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower
shall not have so made such payment, each Lender shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

            (c)   Computations. Except for interest on Base Rate Loans which
shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year as the case may be
(unless the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Rate), all
computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. Interest shall accrue
from and including the date of borrowing (or continuation or conversion) but
excluding the date of payment.

                                  ARTICLE III
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

            SECTION 3.01 TAXES.

            (a)   Payments Net of Certain Taxes. Any and all payments by any
Credit Party to or for the account of any Lender or any Agent hereunder or under
any other Senior Finance Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding any and all Excluded Taxes (all such non-Excluded Taxes being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall be required by
law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under
this Agreement or any other Senior Finance Document to any Lender or any Agent,
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) such Lender or
such Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make
such deductions and withholdings, (ii) such Credit Party shall pay the full
amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) such Credit Party shall
furnish to the Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent's Office, the
original or a certified copy of a receipt, if any, evidencing payment thereof or
other documentation evidencing such payment.

            (b)   Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and
all present or future stamp or documentary, excise or property taxes or similar
charges or levies (including mortgage recording taxes) which arise from any
payment made by it under this Agreement or any other Senior Finance Document or
from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or any other Senior Finance Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

            (c)   Additional Taxes. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender
and each Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 3.01), as applicable,

                                      -67-

<PAGE>

whether or not correctly or legally asserted, paid by such Lender or such Agent
(as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto; provided, however, that if
the Borrower reasonably believes that such Taxes or Other Taxes were not
correctly or legally asserted, the Administrative Agent or the Lender, as the
case may be, will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to
obtain a refund of such Taxes or other Taxes so long as such efforts would not,
in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent or the Lender, as the case
may be, result in any additional costs, expenses or risks or be otherwise
disadvantageous to it.

            (d)   U.S. Tax Forms and Certificates. Each Lender organized under
the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (a "Non-U.S. Lender"), on
or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case
of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date
on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to
time thereafter as required by law, shall provide the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN, W-8 IMY or
W-8 ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate
of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that the income
receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct
of a trade or business in the United States, and (ii) any other form or
certificate required by any taxing authority (including any certificate required
by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code), certifying that
such Lender is entitled to an exemption from or a reduced rate of tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Senior Finance
Documents. Should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a
reduced rate of withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure
to deliver a form required to be delivered hereunder, the Borrower shall take
such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
recover such Taxes.

            (e)   Obligations in Respect of Non-U.S. Lenders. The Borrower shall
not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender or to pay any additional
amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of Taxes (other than Other Taxes)
pursuant to subsection (a) above to the extent that the obligation to withhold
amounts with respect to Taxes (other than Other Taxes) existed on the date such
Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a
participant, on the date such participant acquired its participation interest)
or, with respect to payments to a new Applicable Lending Office, the date such
Non-U.S. Lender designated such new Applicable Lending Office with respect to a
Loan; provided, however, that this subsection (e) shall not apply (i) to any
participant or new Applicable Lending Office that becomes a participant or new
Applicable Lending Office as a result of an assignment, participation, transfer
or designation made at the request of the Borrower and (ii) to the extent the
indemnity payment or additional amounts any participant, or any Lender acting
through a new Applicable Lending Office, would be entitled to receive (without
regard to this subsection (e)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or additional
amounts that the Person making the assignment, participation or transfer to such
participant, or Lender (or participant) making the designation of such new
Applicable Lending Office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of
such assignment, participation, transfer or designation.

            (f)   Mitigation. If any Credit Party is required to pay additional
amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01, then
such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of
its Applicable Lending Office or to file or deliver to the Borrower any
certificate or document so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment
which may thereafter accrue if such change, filing or delivery, in the judgment
of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

                                      -68-

<PAGE>

            (g)   Tax Receipts. Within thirty days after the date of any payment
of Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or
a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment (to the extent the
Borrower receives a receipt for such payment).

            (h)   Refunds or Credits. If any Lender or Agent (i) receives a
refund from a taxation authority in respect of any tax for which it has been
indemnified by a Credit Party or with respect to which a Credit Party has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 or (ii) claims any credit or
other tax benefit (such credit to include any increase in any foreign tax
credit) with respect to any tax for which it has been indemnified by a Credit
Party or with respect to which a Credit Party has paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 3.01, which refund, credit or other tax benefit in the
sole judgment of such Lender or Agent is directly attributable to any such
indemnified tax or additional amounts, such Lender or Agent shall (within 30
days from the date of such receipt) pay over to such Credit Party the amount of
such refund, credit or other tax benefit (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Credit Party with respect to
the tax giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including any taxes on a refund or on interest received or credited) which such
Lender or Agent certifies that it has reasonably determined to have been
incurred in connection with obtaining such refund, credit or other tax benefit;
provided, however, that (i) each Credit Party shall repay, upon the request of
such Lender or Agent, the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus penalties,
interest or other charges) to such Lender or Agent in the event such Lender or
Agent is required to repay such refund or credit to such tax authority, (ii)
such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall have no obligation to cooperate
with respect to any contest (or continue to cooperate with respect to any
contest), or to seek or claim any refund, credit or other tax benefit if such
Lender or Agent determines that its interest would be adversely affected by so
cooperating (or continuing to cooperate) or by seeking or claiming any such
refund, credit or other tax benefit and (iii) no Credit Party shall have any
right to examine the tax returns or other records of any Lender or Agent or to
obtain any information with respect thereto by reason of the provisions of this
Section 3.01 or any judgment or determination made by any Lender or Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.01.

            SECTION 3.02 CHANGE IN LAW, ETC. If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable Law, or any change in any applicable
Law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of Law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall
make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office)
to make, maintain or fund any of its Eurodollar Loans and, in each such case,
the affected Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrower,
whereupon, until each affected Lender notifies the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, (i) the obligation of each affected Lender to make Eurodollar
Loans, or to convert outstanding Loans into Eurodollar Loans, shall be
suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 3.02, such Lender shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office
if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in
the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. If
such notice is given, each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall
be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current
Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day or (ii) immediately, if such
Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund
such Loan to such day.

            SECTION 3.03 BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR
UNFAIR. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Loan:

                                      -69-

<PAGE>

                  (i)   the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
      shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the
      relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
      ascertaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (ii)  Lenders having 50% or more of the aggregate amount of
      the Commitments of the relevant Class advise the Administrative Agent that
      the London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative
      Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
      funding their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and
the relevant Lenders, whereupon, until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,
(i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, or to continue or
convert outstanding Loans as or into Eurodollar Loans, shall be suspended and
(ii) each outstanding Eurodollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan
on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto. Unless
the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days before
the date of any Eurodollar Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has
previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing
shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing in the same aggregate amount as
the requested Borrowing and shall bear interest for each day from and including
the first day to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto at the rate applicable to Revolving Base Rate Loans for such day.

            SECTION 3.04 INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCED RETURN.

            (a)   If on or after the date hereof, the adoption of or any change
in any applicable Law or in the interpretation or application thereof applicable
to any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office), or compliance by any Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of Law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority,
in each case made subsequent to the Effective Date (or, if later, the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender):

                  (i)   shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
      Office) to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Letter of
      Credit, any Eurodollar Loans made by it or any of its Notes or its
      obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or to participate in Letters of
      Credit, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender (or its
      Applicable Lending Office) in respect thereof (except for (A) Taxes and
      Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 (including Taxes imposed solely by
      reason of any failure of such Lender to comply with its obligations under
      Section 3.01(d)) and (B) Excluded Taxes);

                  (ii)  shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
      special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
      held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances,
      loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds
      by, any office of such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) which is
      not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate
      hereunder; or

                  (iii) shall impose on such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
      Office) any other condition (excluding any tax of any kind whatsoever);

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of
Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in

                                      -70-

<PAGE>

any such case, upon notice to the Borrower from such Lender, through the
Administrative Agent, in accordance herewith, the Borrower shall be obligated to
pay such Lender, within 10 Business Days of its demand, any additional amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender on an after-tax basis (after taking into
account applicable deductions and credits in respect of the amount indemnified)
for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

            (b)   If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption or the
becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof in the interpretation or administration of, any
applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, or compliance by such Lender, or its
parent corporation, with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of Law) of any such Governmental Authority,
central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's (or parent corporation's) capital or assets as a
consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender, or its parent corporation, could have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such
Lender's (or parent corporation's) policies with respect to capital adequacy),
then, upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be
obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender on an after-tax basis (after taking into account
applicable deductions and credits in respect of the amount indemnified) for such
reduction; provided, that the Borrower shall not required to compensate any
Lender pursuant to subsection (a) above or this subsection (b) for any
additional costs or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date
such Lender notifies the Borrower of the circumstances giving rise to such
additional costs or reductions and of such Lender's intentions to claim
compensation therefor, and provided, further, that, if the Change in Law or in
the interpretation or administration thereof giving rise to such additional
costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above
shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. Each
determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this Section 3.04 shall,
absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

            (c)   A certificate in reasonable detail of each Lender setting
forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or
its holding company as specified in subsection (a) or (b) above, as the case may
be, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrower shall pay each Lender or the Issuing Lender the amount shown
as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 10 Business Days after
receipt of the same.

            (d)   Promptly after any Lender becomes aware of any circumstance
that will, in its reasonable judgment, result in a request for increased
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.04, such Lender shall notify the
Borrower thereof. Failure on the part of any Lender so to notify the Borrower or
to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received
or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall
not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with
respect to such period or any other period, except as expressly otherwise
provided above. The protection of this Section 3.04 shall be available to each
Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or
inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or
condition which shall have occurred or been imposed.

            SECTION 3.05 FUNDING LOSSES. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Lender against any loss or expense (but excluding in any event loss of
anticipated profit) which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of
(i) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of any Borrowing
hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (ii) any failure by
the Borrower to borrow or to refinance, convert or continue any Loan hereunder
after irrevocable notice of such Borrowing, refinancing, conversion or
continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.02 or 2.07, (iii) any payment,
prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan, whether voluntary or involuntary,
pursuant to

                                      -71-

<PAGE>

any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made on a date other than the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (iv) the assignment of
any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.10(d),
including, in each such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or
incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof
as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense (other than loss of
anticipated profits) shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, as
reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for
the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted, not borrowed or assigned (based on the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate), for the period from the date of such
payment, prepayment, conversion, failure to borrow, convert or continue to the
last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date
of such failure to borrow, convert or continue) or assignment over (ii) the
amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be
realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid, converted,

            SECTION 3.06 BASE RATE LOANS SUBSTITUTED FOR AFFECTED EURODOLLAR
LOANS. If (i) the obligation of any Lender to make, or to continue or convert
outstanding Loans as or to, Eurodollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to
Section 3.02 or (ii) any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 3.01 or
3.04 with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, and in any such case the Borrower
shall, by at least five Business Days' prior notice to such Lender through the
Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section 3.06
shall apply to such Lender, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for
compensation no longer exist, all Loans which would otherwise be made by such
Lender as (or continued as or converted to) Eurodollar Loans shall instead be
Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Eurodollar Loans of the other Lenders). If
such Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist, the principal amount of
each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Eurodollar Loan on the first
day of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to the related Eurodollar
Loans of the other Lenders.

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            Each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and the Borrower represents
and warrants that:

            SECTION 5.01 ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. Each of the Group

jurisdiction where qualification or licensing is required by the nature of its
business or the character and location of its property, business or customers,

Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 5.02 POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Each of
the Credit Parties has the corporate, partnership, limited liability company or
other necessary power and authority, and the legal right, to execute, deliver

each other Transaction Document to which any Credit Party or Holdings is a party
when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each Credit Party thereto and, to the knowledge of Holdings and
the Borrower enforceable against each

                                      -80-

<PAGE>

such Person in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii)
that rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be
limited by equitable principles of general applicability (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

            SECTION 5.03 NO CONFLICTS. Neither the execution and delivery by any
Credit Party of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor performance of and
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by such Person, nor the

it is a party or by which it may be bound or (iv) result in or require the
creation of any Lien (other than the Lien of the Collateral Documents) upon or
with respect to its properties, except in the case of clause (iii) for such
violations as could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 5.04 NO DEFAULT. Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.04, none
of the Group Companies is in default in any respect under (i) any loan
agreement, indenture, mortgage, security agreement or other agreement relating
to Debt or any other contract, lease, agreement or obligation to which it is a
party or by which any of its properties is bound which default could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the Subordinated Debentures
Indenture or (iii) the Junior Debentures Indenture. No Default or Event of
Default has occurred or exists.

            SECTION 5.05 FINANCIAL CONDITION.

            (a)   Audited Financial Statements. The consolidated balance sheets
of Holdings and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, December
31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and the related consolidated and consolidating
statements of income and cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended,
reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, copies of each of which have been
delivered to each of the Lenders, fairly present in all material respects, in
accordance with GAAP (except as disclosed therein), the consolidated financial
position of Holdings and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of each such date and
their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such fiscal year.

            (b)   Pro-Forma Financial Statements. The consolidated balance sheet
of Holdings and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of the most recent
fiscal quarter prior to the Closing Date for which financial information is
available, prepared on a pro-forma basis in accordance with Regulation S-X
giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, has heretofore been
furnished to each Lender as part of the Pre-Commitment Information. Such
pro-forma balance sheet has been prepared in good faith by the Borrower, based
on the assumptions used to prepare the pro-forma financial information contained
in the Pre-Commitment Information (which assumptions are believed by the
Borrower on the date hereof and on the Closing Date to be reasonable and fair in
light of current conditions and facts known to the Borrower), is based on the
best information available to the Borrower as of the date of delivery thereof,
accurately reflects all material adjustments required to be made to give effect
to the Transactions and presents fairly on a pro-forma basis the estimated
consolidated financial position of Holdings and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2003, assuming that the Transactions had actually occurred on
that date. None of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries has any reason to believe
that

                                      -81-

<PAGE>

such pro-forma balance sheet is misleading in any material respect in light of
the circumstances existing at the time of the preparation thereof.

            (c)   Projections. The projections prepared as part of, and included
in, the Pre-Commitment Information (which include projected balance sheets,
income and cash flow statements on a quarterly basis for the period from the
Closing Date through December 31, 2008 and on an annual basis for each of the
following two fiscal years) have been prepared on a basis consistent with the
financial statements referred to in subsection (a) above and are based on good
faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be
reasonable and fair in light of current conditions and facts known to the
Borrower at the time delivered. On the Closing Date, such management believes
that such projections are reasonable and attainable, it being recognized by the
Lenders, however, that projections as to future events are not to be viewed as
facts or guaranties of future performance, that actual results during the period
or periods covered by such projections may differ from the projected results and
that such differences may be material and that the Credit Parties make no
representation that such projections will be in fact be realized. There is no
fact known to Holdings or the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect which has not been
disclosed herein or in the Pre-Commitment Information.

            (d)   Post-Closing Financial Statements. The financial statements
delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 6.01(a) and (b), if any, (i) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may otherwise be permitted
under Section 6.01(a) and (b)) and (ii) present fairly in all material respects
(on the basis disclosed in the footnotes to such financial statements, if any)
the consolidated and consolidating financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows of Holdings and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods covered thereby.

            (e)   No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed on Schedule
5.05 hereto or as fully reflected in the financial statements described in
subsection (a) and (b) above and the Debt incurred under this Agreement, the
Subordinated Debentures Documents and the Junior Debentures Documents, (i) there
were as of the Closing Date (and after giving effect to any Loans made and
Letters of Credit issued on such date), no liabilities or obligations (excluding
current obligations and contractual obligations incurred in the ordinary course
of business) with respect to any Group Company of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not due and including
obligations or liabilities for taxes, long-term leases and unusual forward or
other long-term commitments), and (ii) neither Holdings nor the Borrower knows
of any basis for the assertion against any Group Company of any such liability
or obligation in each case which, either individually or in the aggregate, are
or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

            (f)   Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance. To the extent applicable to
each Group Company subject thereto, each required form, report and document
containing financial statements that has been filed with or submitted to the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission since July 31, 2002, was
accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted by the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of any Group Company pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, such certification was true and
accurate and complied in all material respects with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except to the extent the
failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Group Company nor, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower, any
director, senior officer, employee, auditor, accountant or authorized
representative of any Group Company has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies
or methods of any Group Company or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that any Group
Company has

                                      -82-

<PAGE>

engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, in each case which if
determined to be valid could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.05, to the knowledge of Holdings and
the Borrower, no attorney representing any Group Company, whether or not
employed by any Group Company, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by any Group
Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the board of
directors of any Group Company or any committee thereof or to any director or
officer of any Group Company, in each case which if determined to have occurred
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 5.06 NO MATERIAL CHANGE. Since December 31, 2003 there has
been no Material Adverse Effect, and no event or development has occurred which
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 5.07 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; POSSESSION UNDER LEASES. Each
Group Company has good insurable and legal fee title to (in the case of owned
Real Property), or valid leasehold interests in (in the case of Leaseholds), all
its material properties and assets, except for minor defects in title that do
not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted.
All such material properties and assets are free and clear of Liens other than
Permitted Liens. Each Group Company has complied with all obligations under all
leases to which it is a party, other than leases that, individually or in the
aggregate, are not material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, and the
violation of which will not result in a Material Adverse Effect, and all such
leases are in full force and effect, other than leases that, individually or in
the aggregate, are not material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, and in
respect of which the failure to be in full force and effect will not result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Group Company enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all such leases with respect to which it is the lessee, other
than leases that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to the
Group Companies, taken as a whole, and in respect of which the failure to enjoy
peaceful and undisturbed possession will not result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

            SECTION 5.08 LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.08, there
are no actions, suits, investigations or legal, equitable, arbitration or
administrative proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of any Credit Party,
threatened against or affecting any Group Company in which there is a reasonable
possibility of an adverse decision that (i) involve any Senior Finance Document
or any of the Transactions or (ii) if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

            SECTION 5.09 TAXES. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.09 or
otherwise permitted by Section 6.05, each Group Company has filed, or caused to
be filed, all federal and all material state, local and foreign tax returns)
required to be filed and paid (i) all amounts of taxes shown thereon to be due
(including interest and penalties) and (ii) all other taxes, fees, assessments
and other governmental charges (including mortgage recording taxes, documentary
stamp taxes and intangible taxes) owing by it. No Credit Party knows of any
pending investigation of such party by any taxing authority or proposed tax
assessments against any Group Company.

            SECTION 5.10 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.10, each Group Company is in compliance with all requirements of Law
(including Environmental Laws) applicable to it or to its properties, except for
any such failure to comply which could not reasonably be expected to cause a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.10, to the knowledge
of the Credit Parties, none of the Group Companies or any of their respective
material properties or assets is subject to or in default with respect to any
judgment, writ, injunction, decree or order of any court or other Governmental
Authority which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.10,
none of the Group Companies has

                                      -83-

<PAGE>

received any written communication from any Governmental Authority that alleges
that any of the Group Companies is not in compliance in any material respect
with any Law, except for allegations that have been satisfactorily resolved and
are no longer outstanding or which, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 5.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS.

            (a)   ERISA. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.11:

                  (i)   Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect, there are no Unfunded Liabilities (A) with
      respect to any member of the Group Companies and (B) with respect to any
      ERISA Affiliates; provided that for purposes of this Section 5.11(a)(i)(B)
      only, Unfunded Liabilities shall mean the amount (if any) by which the
      projected benefit obligation exceeds the value of the plan's assets as of
      its last valuation date.

                  (ii)  Each Plan complies in all respects with the applicable
      requirements of ERISA and the Code, and each Group Company complies in all
      respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code with
      respect to all Multiemployer Plans to which it contributes, except to the
      extent that the failure to comply therewith would not reasonably be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (iii) Except to the extent that such ERISA Event could not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no ERISA Event
      has occurred or, subject to the passage of time, is reasonably expected to
      occur with respect to any Plan and, except to the extent that such ERISA
      Event would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
      no ERISA Event has occurred or, subject to the passage of time, is
      reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Plan maintained or
      formerly maintained by an ERISA Affiliate.

                  (iv)  No Group Company: (A) is or has been within the last six
      years a party to any Multiemployer Plan; or (B) has completely or
      partially withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan, except to the extent that
      the participation in or withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan could not
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (v)   If any Group Company or any ERISA Affiliate incurred or
      were to incur a complete or partial withdrawal (as described in Section
      4203 of ERISA) from any Multiemployer Plan as of the Closing Date, the
      aggregate withdrawal liability, as determined under Section 4201 of ERISA,
      with respect to all such Multiemployer Plans would not exceed an amount
      that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (vi)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
      consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will not involve
      any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of Section 406 of
      ERISA or in connection with which taxes could be imposed pursuant to
      Section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code, for which an exemption under ERISA
      does not apply.

                  (vii) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect, no Group Company or, to the knowledge of any
      Group Company, any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent liability with
      respect to any post-retirement benefit under a Welfare Plan, other than
      liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of Title I of
      ERISA.

                                      -84-

<PAGE>

                  (viii) No Group Company has any material liability in
      connection with or arising from a Foreign Pension Plan.

            (b)   Employee Benefit Arrangements.

                  (i)   All liabilities under the Employee Benefit Arrangements
      are (A) funded to at least the minimum level required by law or, if
      higher, to the level required by the terms governing the Employee Benefit
      Arrangements, (B) insured with a reputable insurance company, (C) provided
      for or recognized in the financial statements most recently delivered to
      the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.01(c) hereof or (D)
      estimated in the formal notes to the financial statements most recently
      delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.01(a) hereof
      where such failure to fund, insure, provide for, recognize or estimate the
      liabilities arising under such arrangements could reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ii)  There are no circumstances which may give rise to a
      liability in relation to the Employee Benefit Arrangements which are not
      funded, insured, provided for, recognized or estimated in the manner
      described in clause (i) above and which could reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (iii) Each Group Company is in material compliance with all
      applicable Laws, trust documentation and contracts relating to the
      Employee Benefit Arrangements.

                  (iv)  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11, the execution and
      delivery of the Acquisition Agreement and the consummation of the
      transactions contemplated thereby (i) does not require any Group Company
      to make any contributions (including accelerating the timing of
      contributions) in respect of the Hillman Companies Inc. Non-Qualified
      Deferred Compensation Plan and (ii) does not otherwise increase the
      liability of any Group Company under such plan.

            SECTION 5.12 SUBSIDIARIES. Schedule 5.12 sets forth a complete and
accurate list as of the Closing Date of all Subsidiaries of Holdings. Schedule
5.12 sets forth as of the Closing Date the jurisdiction of formation of each
such Subsidiary, whether each such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary Guarantor, the
number of authorized shares of each class of Equity Interests of each such
Subsidiary, the number of outstanding shares of each class of Equity Interests,
the number and percentage of outstanding shares of each class of Equity
Interests of each such Subsidiary owned (directly or indirectly) by any Person
and the number and effect, if exercised, of all Equity Equivalents with respect
to Capital Stock of each such Subsidiary. All the outstanding Equity Interests
of each Subsidiary of Holdings are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
and were not issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any shareholder
and, as of the Closing Date, are owned by Holdings, directly or indirectly, free
and clear of all Liens (other than those arising under the Collateral
Documents). Other than as set forth on Schedule 5.12, as of the Closing Date, no
such Subsidiary has outstanding any Equity Equivalents nor does any such Person
have outstanding any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or any options for
the purchase of, or any agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or
otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to,
its Equity Interests. Holdings has no Subsidiaries, other than Intermediate
Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 5.13 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, ETC.

            (a)   None of Holdings and its Subsidiaries is engaged principally,
or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying "margin stock" within the meaning of
Regulation U. No part of the Letters of Credit or proceeds of the Loans will be
used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
"margin stock" within the

                                      -85-

<PAGE>

meaning of Regulation U. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent,
the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a
statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form
U-1 referred to in Regulation U. No indebtedness being reduced or retired out of
the proceeds of the Loans was or will be incurred for the purpose of purchasing
or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U or any "margin
security" within the meaning of Regulation T. "Margin stock" within the meaning
of Regulation U does not constitute more than 25% of the value of the
consolidated assets of Holdings and its Consolidated Subsidiaries. None of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the direct or indirect
use of the proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or Regulation T, U or X.

            (b)   None of the Group Companies is subject to regulation under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the
Investment Company Act of 1940, each as amended. In addition, none of the Group
Companies is (i) an "investment company" registered or required to be registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (ii) controlled by such a
company, or (iii) a "holding company", a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a
"holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1934, as amended.

            SECTION 5.14 PURPOSE OF LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT. The proceeds of
the Term B Loans and any Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date will be used
solely to fund a portion of the consideration paid pursuant to the Acquisition
Agreement, to refinance existing Debt of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, and to
pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Acquisition Agreement. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans and Swingline
Loans made on and after the Closing Date will be used solely to provide for the
working capital requirements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and for the
general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The Letters of
Credit shall be used only for or in connection with appeal bonds, reimbursement
obligations arising in connection with surety and reclamation bonds,
reinsurance, domestic or international trade transactions and other obligations
relating to transactions entered into by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
the ordinary course of business and for the general corporate purposes of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 5.15 LABOR MATTERS. There are no strikes against Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than any strikes that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. The hours worked and payments made to employees of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries have not been in violation in any material respect of the Fair
Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Law dealing with such matters,
except to the extent any such violation or violations, could not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. All payments due from Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which
any claim may be made against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, on account of
wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. The consummation of the Transactions will not give
rise to a right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any
union under any collective bargaining agreement to which Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor) is bound, other than collective bargaining agreements which,
individually or in the aggregate, are not material to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

            SECTION 5.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed on Schedule
5.16, no Group Company has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to
obtain, maintain, or comply with any permit, license or other approval required

any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to preserve any such rights, licenses,
permits, franchises, authorizations or Intellectual Property if the preservation

and its Subsidiaries or the loss thereof could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 6.03 BOOKS AND RECORDS; LENDER MEETING. Each of the Group
Companies will keep complete and accurate books and records of its transactions
in accordance with good accounting practices on the basis of GAAP (including the

            SECTION 6.04 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS.
Each of the Group Companies will comply with all requirements of Law applicable

Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Group
Companies will do each of the following as it relates to any Plan, Foreign
Pension Plan or Employee Benefit Arrangement, except to the extent that failure
to do any of the following could not reasonably be expected to have a Material

provisions of ERISA, the Code or other Federal, state or foreign law; (ii) cause
each Plan which is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to maintain such
qualifications; (iii) make all required contributions to any Plan subject to
Section 412 of the Code and make all required contributions to Multiemployer
Plans; (iv) ensure that there are no Unfunded Liabilities in excess of an amount
that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (v) except
for the obligations set forth on Schedule 5.11, not become a party to any
Multiemployer Plan; (vi) make all contributions (including any special payments
to amortize any Unfunded Liabilities) required to be made in accordance with all
applicable laws and the terms of each Foreign Pension Plan in a timely manner;
(vii) ensure that all liabilities under the Employee Benefit Arrangements are
either (A) funded to at least the minimum level required by Law or, if higher,
to the level required by the terms governing the Employee Benefit Arrangements;
(B) insured with a reputable insurance company; (C) provided for or recognized
in the accounts most recently delivered to the Administrative Agent under
Section 6.01(c); or (D) estimated in the formal notes to the accounts most
recently delivered to the Administrative Agent under Section 6.01(a); (viii)
ensure that the contributions or premium payments to or in respect of all
Employee Benefit Arrangements are and continue to be promptly paid at no less
than the rates required under the rules of such arrangements and in accordance
with the most recent actuarial advice received in relation to the Employee
Benefit Arrangement and generally in accordance with applicable law; and (ix)
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each ERISA Affiliate to do each of the
items listed in clauses (i) through (iv) above as it relates to Plans maintained
by or contributed to by such ERISA Affiliate.

and discharge (i) all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges or
levies imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits, or upon any of its
properties, before they shall become delinquent and (ii) all lawful claims
(including claims for labor, materials and supplies) which, if unpaid, might
give rise to a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any of its properties;
provided, however, that no Group Company shall be required to pay any such tax,
assessment, charge, levy or claim (i) which is being contested in good

                                      -93-

<PAGE>

faith by appropriate proceedings diligently pursued and as to which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP, (ii) in respect of
immaterial, state, local or foreign taxes, or (iii) unless the failure to make
any such payment (A) could give rise to an immediate right to foreclose on a
Lien securing such amounts (unless proceedings thereto conclusively operate to
stay such foreclosure) or (B) could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 6.06 INSURANCE; CERTAIN PROCEEDS.

            (a)   Insurance Policies. Each of the Group Companies will at all
times maintain in full force and effect insurance (including worker's
compensation insurance, liability insurance or casualty insurance) in such
amounts, covering such risk and liabilities and with such deductibles or
self-insurance retentions as are in accordance with normal industry practice or
otherwise consistent with past practice of the Group Companies or prudent in the
reasonable business judgment of the senior management of the Borrower. The
Collateral Agent shall be named as loss payee or mortgagee, as its interest may
appear, with respect to all such property and casualty policies and additional
insured with respect to all such other policies (other than workers'
compensation, employee health and directors and officers policies), and each
provider of any such insurance shall agree, by endorsement upon the policy or
policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to the Collateral
Agent, that if the insurance carrier shall have received written notice from the
Collateral Agent of the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the
insurance carrier shall pay all proceeds otherwise payable to Holdings or one or
more of its Subsidiaries under such policies directly to the Collateral Agent
(which agreement shall be evidenced by a "standard" or "New York" lender's loss
payable endorsement in the name of the Collateral Agent on Accord Form 27) and
that it will give the Collateral Agent 30 days' prior written notice before any
such policy or policies shall be altered or canceled, and that no act or default
of any Group Company or any other Person shall affect the rights of the
Collateral Agent or the Lenders under such policy or policies.

            (b)   Loss Events. In case of any Casualty or Condemnation with
respect to any property of any Group Company or any part thereof in excess of
$1,000,000, the Borrower shall promptly give written notice thereof to the
Administrative Agent generally describing the nature and extent of such damage,
destruction or taking. The Borrower shall, or shall cause such Group Company to,
repair, restore or replace the property of such Person (or part thereof) which
was subject to such Casualty or Condemnation, at such Person's cost and expense,
whether or not the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Award, if any, received on
account of such event shall be sufficient for that purpose; provided, however,
that such property need not be repaired, restored or replaced to the extent the
failure to make such repair, restoration or replacement (i) is desirable to the
proper conduct of the business of such Person in the ordinary course and
otherwise in the best interest of such Person or (ii) the failure to repair,
restore or replace the property is attributable to the contemplated application
of the Insurance Proceeds from such Casualty or the Condemnation Award from such
Condemnation to the acquisition of other tangible assets used or useful in the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as contemplated in the definition
of "Reinvestment Funds" in Section 1.01 or to payment of the Senior Obligations
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.09(b)(iv).

            (c)   Certain Rights of the Lenders. In connection with the
covenants set forth in this Section 6.06, it is understood and agreed that none
of the Agents, the Lenders or their respective agents or employees shall be
liable for any loss or damage insured by the insurance policies required to be
maintained under this Section 6.06, it being understood that the Group Companies
shall look solely to their insurance companies or any other parties other than
the aforesaid parties for the recovery of such loss or damage.

            SECTION 6.07 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY. Each of the Group Companies
will maintain and preserve its properties and equipment material to the conduct
of its business in good repair, working

                                      -94-

order and condition, normal wear and tear and Casualty and Condemnation
excepted, and will make, or cause to be made, as to such properties and
equipment from time to time all repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions,
additions, betterments and improvements thereto as may be needed or proper in
the reasonable good faith business judgment of the Responsible Officers of such
Group Companies.

            SECTION 6.08 USE OF PROCEEDS. The Borrower will use the proceeds of
the Loans and will use the Letters of Credit solely for the purposes set forth
in Section 5.14.

            SECTION 6.09 AUDITS/INSPECTIONS. Upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, each of the Group Companies will permit representatives
appointed by the Agents or the Required Lenders to visit and inspect its
executive offices and/or manufacturing facilities and, following the occurrence
and during the continuance of any Event of Default, any of its properties, to
review and inspect its books and records, accounts receivable and inventory, and
to make photocopies or photographs thereof and to write down and record any
information such representatives obtain and shall permit the Agents or such
representatives to investigate and verify the accuracy of information provided
to the Lenders and to discuss all such matters with the officers, employees,
independent accountants and representatives of the Group Companies, in each case
so long as a Responsible Officer has been given the opportunity to be present;
provided, however, that prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default, such visits shall be limited to one per year per location, and the
Group Companies shall not be obligated to reimburse the expenses of more than
two representatives of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the
aggregate.

            SECTION 6.10 ADDITIONAL CREDIT PARTIES; ADDITIONAL SECURITY.

            (a)   Additional Subsidiary Guarantors. Each of Holdings and the
Borrower will take, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than Foreign
Subsidiaries, except to the extent provided in subsection (d) below) to take,
such actions from time to time as shall be necessary to ensure that all
Subsidiaries of Holdings (other than the Borrower and Foreign Subsidiaries,
except to the extent provided in subsection (d) below) are Subsidiary
Guarantors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Group
Company shall form or acquire any new Subsidiary, the Borrower, as soon as
practicable and in any event within 30 days after such formation or acquisition,
will provide the Collateral Agent with notice of such formation or acquisition
setting forth in reasonable detail a description of all of the assets of such
new Subsidiary and will cause such new Subsidiary (other than a Foreign
Subsidiary, except to the extent provided in subsection (d) below) to:

                  (i)   within 30 days after such formation or acquisition,
      execute an Accession Agreement pursuant to which such new Subsidiary shall
      agree to become a "Guarantor" under the Guaranty, an "Obligor" under the
      Security Agreement, an "Obligor" under the U.S. Pledge Agreement and/or an
      obligor under such other Collateral Documents as may be applicable to such
      new Subsidiary; and

                  (ii)  deliver such proof of organizational authority,
      incumbency of officers, opinions of counsel and other documents as is
      consistent with those delivered by each Credit Party pursuant to Section
      4.01 on the Closing Date or as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
      Agent or the Required Lenders reasonably shall have requested.

            (b)   Additional Security. Each of Holdings and the Borrower will
cause, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries (other than a Foreign Subsidiary,
except to the extent provided in subsection (d) below) to cause, (i) all of its
owned Real Properties and personal property located in the United States, other
that those owned Real Properties set forth on Schedule 6.10(b) and other than
owned Real Properties which are subject to a Permitted Lien the terms of which
prohibit the granting of a Lien thereon

                                      -95-

<PAGE>

in favor of the Finance Parties and (ii) to the extent deemed to be material by
the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in its or their sole reasonable
discretion, (A) all of its personal property located in the United States
(except to the extent expressly excluded from the Collateral Documents), (B) all
of its leased Real Properties located in the United States (other than
leaseholds the terms of which prohibit the granting of a Lien thereon in favor
of the Finance Parties) and (C) all other assets and properties of Holdings and
its Domestic Subsidiaries located in the United States as are not covered by the
original Collateral Documents (or specifically excluded therefrom) and as may be
requested by the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole
reasonable discretion to be subject at all times to first priority (subject only
to Permitted Liens), perfected and, in the case of Real Property (whether leased
or owned), title insured Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the
Collateral Documents or such other security agreements, pledge agreements,
mortgages or similar collateral documents as the Collateral Agent shall request
in its sole and reasonable discretion (collectively, the "Additional Collateral
Documents"). With respect to any Real Property (whether leased or owned) located
in the United States acquired or leased by any Credit Party subsequent to the
Closing Date for which the Collateral Agent is entitled to a Lien pursuant to
the preceding sentence, such Person will cause to be delivered to the Collateral
Agent with respect to such Real Property (other than immaterial leased
properties or except for properties with respect to which landlord consent for
such Mortgage cannot be obtained after commercially reasonable efforts by the
Borrower, to do so or as otherwise approved by the Administrative Agent)
documents, instruments and other items of the types required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 4.01(k), all in form, content and scope reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. In furtherance of the foregoing terms of
this Section 6.10, the Borrower agrees to promptly provide the Administrative
Agent with written notice of the acquisition by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Real Property located in the United States having a market
value greater than $500,000 or the entering into a lease by Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries of any Real Property located in the United States for annual
rent of $150,000 or more, setting forth in each case in reasonable detail the
location and a description of the asset(s) so acquired or leased. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Holdings and the Borrower will cause,
and will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to cause, 100% of the
Equity Interests of each of their respective direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(or 65% of such Equity Interests, if such Subsidiary is a direct Foreign
Subsidiary, except as provided in subsection (d) below) to be subject at all
times to a first priority, perfected Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents, subject only
to Permitted Liens described in paragraph (ii) and/or (iv) of Section 7.02.

            If, subsequent to the Closing Date, a Credit Party shall acquire any
Intellectual Property, securities, instruments, chattel paper or other personal
property required to be delivered to the Collateral Agent as Collateral under
any of the Collateral Documents, the Borrower shall promptly (and in any event
within 10 Business Days after any Responsible Officer of any Credit Party
acquires knowledge of the same) notify the Collateral Agent of the same. Each of
the Credit Parties shall adhere to the covenants regarding the location of
personal property as set forth in the Collateral Documents.

            All such security interests and mortgages shall be granted pursuant
to documentation consistent with the Collateral Documents executed at Closing
and otherwise reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Collateral
Agent and shall constitute valid and enforceable perfected security interests
and mortgages prior to the rights of all third Persons and subject to no other
Liens except for Permitted Liens. The Additional Collateral Documents or
instruments related thereto shall have been duly recorded or filed in such
manner and in such places as are required by law to establish, perfect, preserve
and protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent required to be granted
pursuant to the Additional Collateral Documents, and all taxes, fees and other
charges payable in connection therewith shall have been paid in full. The
Borrower shall cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent such opinions of
counsel, title insurance and other related documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Collateral Agent to assure itself that this Section 6.10(b) has
been complied with.

            (c)   Real Property Appraisals. If the Collateral Agent or the
Required Lenders determine that they are required by law or regulation to have
appraisals prepared in respect of the Real Property of any Group Company
constituting Collateral, the Borrower shall provide to the Collateral Agent
appraisals which satisfy the applicable requirements set forth in 12 C.F.R.,
Part 34 - Subpart C or any successor or similar statute, rule, regulation,
guideline or order, and which shall be in scope, form and substance, and from
appraisers, reasonably satisfactory to the Required Lenders and shall be
accompanied by a certification of the appraisal firm providing such appraisals
that the appraisals comply with such requirements.

            (d)   Foreign Subsidiaries Security. If, following a change that is
reasonably determined to be relevant by the Administrative Agent in the relevant
sections of the Code or the regulations, rules, rulings, notices or other
official pronouncements issued or promulgated thereunder, counsel for the
Borrower reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders
fails within 90 days after a reasonable request from the Collateral Agent and
the Required Lenders to deliver evidence, in form and substance mutually
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Borrower, with respect to any
Foreign Subsidiary of Holdings which has not already had all of the Equity
Interests issued by it pledged pursuant to the Pledge Agreement that (i) a
pledge (A) of two-thirds or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of capital stock of such Foreign Subsidiary entitled to vote, and (B) of
any promissory note issued by such Foreign Subsidiary to the Borrower or any of
its Domestic Subsidiaries, (ii) the entering into by such Foreign Subsidiary of
a guaranty in form and substance substantially similar to the Guaranty, (iii)
the entering into by such Foreign Subsidiary of a security agreement in form and
substance substantially similar to the Security Agreement, and (iv) the entering
into by such Foreign Subsidiary of a pledge agreement substantially similar to
the Pledge Agreement, in any such case would reasonably be expected to be
restricted by applicable Law of the jurisdiction of organization of such Foreign
Subsidiary or would reasonably be expected to cause the undistributed earnings
or future earnings, if any, of such Foreign Subsidiary as determined for United
States federal income tax purposes to be included as gross income of such
Foreign Subsidiary's United States parent (or other domestic Affiliate) for
United States federal income tax purposes, then, (A) in the case of a failure to
deliver the evidence described in clause (i) above, that portion of such Foreign
Subsidiary's outstanding capital stock or any promissory notes so issued by such
Foreign Subsidiary, in each case not theretofore pledged pursuant to the Pledge
Agreement, shall be pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Finance Parties pursuant to the Pledge Agreement (or another pledge agreement in
substantially similar form, if needed), in each case only to the extent that
such pledge would not reasonably be expected to cause the undistributed earnings
or future earnings, if any, of such Foreign Subsidiary as determined for United
States federal income tax purposes to be included in gross income of such
Foreign Subsidiary's United States parent (or other domestic Affiliate) for
United States federal income tax purposes or would not reasonably be expected to
be restricted by Applicable Law of the jurisdiction of organization of such
Foreign Subsidiary; (B) in the case of a failure to deliver the evidence
described in clause (ii) above, such Foreign Subsidiary shall execute and
deliver the Guaranty (or another guaranty in substantially similar form, if
needed), guaranteeing the Finance Obligations; (C) in the case of a failure to
deliver the evidence described in clause (iii) above, such Foreign Subsidiary
shall execute and deliver the Security Agreement (or another security agreement
in substantially similar form, if needed), granting to the Collateral Agent, for
the benefit of the Finance Parties, a security interest in all of such Foreign
Subsidiary's assets and securing the Finance Obligations; and (D) in the case of
a failure to deliver the evidence described in clause (iv) above, such Foreign
Subsidiary shall execute and deliver the Pledge Agreement (or another pledge
agreement in substantially similar form, if needed), pledging to the Collateral
Agent, for the benefit of the Finance Parties, all of the capital stock and
promissory notes owned by such Foreign Subsidiary, in each case to the extent
that entering into the Guaranty, Security Agreement or Pledge Agreement is
permitted by the Laws of the respective foreign jurisdiction and with all
documents delivered pursuant to this Section 6.10(d) to be in form, scope and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Required
Lenders.

            (e)   Each of Holdings and the Borrower agrees that, except as
otherwise provided in this Section 6.10, each action required by this Section
6.10 shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later
than 90 days after such action is either requested to be taken by the Collateral
Agent or the Required Lenders or required to be taken by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10.

            SECTION 6.11 INTEREST RATE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS. Within 90 days
after the Closing Date, the Borrower will enter into and thereafter maintain in
full force and effect interest rate swaps, rate caps, collars or other similar
agreements or arrangements designed to hedge the position of the Borrower with
respect to interest rates at rates and on terms reasonably satisfactory to the
Lead Arrangers, taking into account current market conditions, the effect of
which is that at least 50% of the Consolidated Debt of Holdings and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries will bear interest at a fixed or capped rate or the
interest cost in respect of which will be fixed or capped for a period expiring
no earlier than 24 months after the Closing Date. The Borrower will promptly
deliver evidence of the execution and delivery of such agreements to the
Administrative Agent.

            SECTION 6.12 CONTRIBUTIONS. Within three Business Days following its
receipt thereof, Holdings will contribute as a common equity contribution to the
capital of Intermediate Holdings which will then contribute an equal amount to
the capital of the Borrower, any cash proceeds received by Holdings after the
Closing Date from any Asset Disposition, Casualty, Condemnation, Debt Issuance
or Equity Issuance or any cash capital contributions received by Holdings after
the Closing Date (less any Restricted Payments permitted under Section 7.07 and
made in connection with such Asset Disposition, Casualty, Condemnation, Debt
Issuance, Equity Issuance or cash capital contribution).

            (k)   Ownership. A Change of Control shall occur.

            (l)   Subordinated Debt. (i) Any Governmental Authority with

            SECTION 8.02 ACCELERATION; REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, and at any time thereafter unless and until such Event of Default
has been waived in writing by the Required Lenders (or the Lenders as may be
required pursuant to Section 10.03), the Administrative Agent (or the Collateral
Agent, as applicable) shall, upon the request and direction of the Required
Lenders, by written notice to the Borrower, take any of the following actions
without prejudice to the rights of the Agents or any Lender to enforce its
claims against the Credit Parties except as otherwise specifically provided for
herein:

            (a)   Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments terminated
whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

            (b)   Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal of and any
accrued interest in respect of all Loans, any reimbursement obligations arising
from drawings under Letters of Credit and any and all other indebtedness or
obligations of any and every kind owing by a Credit Party to any of the Lenders
hereunder to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

            (c)   Cash Collateral. Direct the Borrower to pay (and the Borrower
agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default under Section 8.01(f), it will immediately pay) to the Collateral Agent
additional cash, to be held by the Collateral Agent, for the

                                     -120-

<PAGE>

benefit of the Lenders, in a cash collateral account as additional security for
the LC Obligations in respect of subsequent drawings under all then outstanding
Letters of Credit in an amount equal to 105% of the maximum aggregate amount
which may be drawn under all Letters of Credits then outstanding.

            (d)   Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
interests created and existing under the Senior Finance Documents, including,
without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Collateral
Documents, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of
set-off.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in
Section 8.01(f) shall occur, then the Commitments shall automatically terminate
and all Loans, all reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit, all
accrued interest in respect thereof and all accrued and unpaid fees and other
indebtedness or obligations owing to the Lenders hereunder and under the other
Senior Finance Documents shall immediately become due and payable without the
giving of any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders,
which notice or other action is expressly waived by the Credit Parties.

            Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside primarily
with the Administrative Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by law,
a separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate "creditor"
holding a separate "claim" within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any other insolvency statute.

            In case any one or more of the covenants and/or agreements set forth
in this Agreement or any other Senior Finance Document shall have been breached
by any Credit Party, then the Administrative Agent may proceed to protect and
enforce the Lenders' rights either by suit in equity and/or by action at law,
including an action for damages as a result of any such breach and/or an action
for specific performance of any such covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or such other Senior Finance Document. Without limitation of the
foregoing, the Borrower agrees that failure to comply with any of the covenants
contained herein will cause irreparable harm and that specific performance shall
be available in the event of any breach thereof. The Administrative Agent acting
pursuant to this paragraph shall be indemnified by the Borrower against all
liability, loss or damage, together with all reasonable costs and expenses
related thereto (including reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses) in
accordance with Section 10.05.

            SECTION 8.03 ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT.

            (a)   Priority of Distributions. The Borrower hereby irrevocably
waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments in respect of
its Finance Obligations and any proceeds of Collateral after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default and agrees that, notwithstanding
the provisions of Sections 2.09(b) and 2.14, after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Finance Party on account of
amounts then due and outstanding under any of the Senior Finance Documents or
any Derivative Agreement or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or
delivered in respect of its Finance Obligations as follows:

                  FIRST, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion of
      the Revolving Loans that the Administrative Agent may have advanced on
      behalf of any Lender for which the Administrative Agent has not then been
      reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower;

                  SECOND, to pay interest on and then principal of any Swingline
      Loan;

                                     -121-

<PAGE>

                  THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
      and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Administrative
      Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of
      the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents, including all expenses of
      sale or other realization of or in respect of the Collateral, including
      reasonable compensation to the agents and counsel for the Collateral
      Agent, and all expenses, liabilities and advances incurred or made by the
      Collateral Agent in connection therewith, and any other obligations owing
      to the Collateral Agent in respect of sums advanced by the Collateral
      Agent to preserve the Collateral or to preserve its security interest in
      the Collateral;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
      and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of (i) each of the
      Lenders (including any Issuing Lender in its capacity as such) in
      connection with enforcing its rights under the Senior Finance Documents or
      otherwise with respect to the Senior Obligations owing to such Lender and
      (ii) each Derivatives Creditor in connection with enforcing any of its
      rights under the Derivatives Agreements or otherwise with respect to the
      Derivatives Obligations owing to such Derivatives Creditor;

                  FIFTH, to the payment of all of the Senior Obligations
      consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                  SIXTH, except as set forth in clauses First through Fifth
      above, to the payment of the outstanding Senior Obligations and
      Derivatives Obligations owing to any Finance Party, pro-rata, as set forth
      below, with (i) an amount equal to the Senior Obligations being paid to
      the Collateral Agent (in the case of Senior Obligations owing to the
      Collateral Agent) or to the Administrative Agent (in the case of all other
      Senior Obligations) for the account of the Lenders or any Agent, with the
      Collateral Agent, each Lender and the Agents receiving an amount equal to
      its outstanding Senior Obligations, or, if the proceeds are insufficient
      to pay in full all Senior Obligations, its Pro-Rata Share of the amount
      remaining to be distributed, and (ii) an amount equal to the Derivatives
      Obligations being paid to the trustee, paying agent or other similar
      representative (each a "Representative") for the Derivatives Creditors,
      with each Derivatives Creditor receiving an amount equal to the
      outstanding Derivatives Obligations owed to it by the Credit Parties or,
      if the proceeds are insufficient to pay in full all such Derivatives
      Obligations, its Pro-Rata Share of the amount remaining to be distributed;

                  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever
      may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

            In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied
in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
succeeding category; (ii) each of the Finance Parties shall receive an amount
equal to its Pro-Rata Share of amounts available to be applied pursuant to
clauses "FOURTH", "FIFTH", and "SIXTH"" above; and (iii) to the extent that any
amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "SIXTH" above are
attributable to the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit,
such amounts shall be held by the Collateral Agent in a cash collateral account
and applied (x) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time for any
drawings under such Letters of Credit and (y) then, following the expiration of
all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clause
"SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 8.03.

            (b)   Pro-Rata Treatment. For purposes of this Section, "Pro-Rata
Share" means, when calculating a Finance Party's portion of any distribution or
amount, that amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to a fraction the
numerator of which is the then unpaid amount of such Finance Party's Senior
Obligations or Derivatives Obligations, as the case may be, and the denominator
of which is the

                                     -122-

<PAGE>

then outstanding amount of all Senior Obligations or Derivatives Obligations, as
the case may be. When payments to the Finance Parties are based upon their
respective Pro-Rata Shares, the amounts received by such Finance Parties
hereunder shall be applied (for purposes of making determinations under this
Section 8.03 only) (i) first, to their Senior Obligations and (ii) second, to
their Derivatives Obligations. If any payment to any Finance Party of its
Pro-Rata Share of any distribution would result in overpayment to such Finance
Party, such excess amount shall instead be distributed in respect of the unpaid
Senior Obligations or Derivatives Obligations, as the case may be, of the other
Finance Parties, with each Finance Party whose Senior Obligations or Derivatives
Obligations, as the case may be, have not been paid in full to receive an amount
equal to such excess amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the unpaid Senior Obligations or Derivatives Obligations, as the case may be, of
such Finance Party and the denominator of which is the unpaid Senior Obligations
or Derivatives Obligations, as the case may be, of all Finance Parties entitled
to such distribution.

            (c)   Distributions with Respect to Letters of Credit. Each of the
Finance Parties agrees and acknowledges that if (after all outstanding Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit have been paid in
full) the Lenders are to receive a distribution on account of undrawn amounts
with respect to Letters of Credit issued (or deemed issued) under the Credit
Agreement, such amounts shall be deposited in the LC Cash Collateral Account as
cash security for the repayment of Senior Obligations owing to the Lenders as
such. Upon termination of all outstanding Letters of Credit, all of such cash
security shall be applied to the remaining Senior Obligations of the Lenders. If
there remains any excess cash security, such excess cash shall be withdrawn by
the Collateral Agent from the LC Cash Collateral Account and distributed in
accordance with Section 8.03(a) hereof.

            (d)   Distributions of Funds on Deposit in a Prepayment Account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.03, amounts on
deposit in a Prepayment Account for any Class of Loans shall be applied upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default, first, to pay Loans of such Class and,
second, after all the Loans of such Class have been paid in full, to the other
Senior Obligations in the manner provided in this Section 8.03.

            (e)   Reliance by Collateral Agent. For purposes of applying
payments received in accordance with this Section 8.03, the Collateral Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon (i) the Administrative Agent under the Credit
Agreement and (ii) the Representative, if any, for the Derivatives Creditors for
a determination (which the Administrative Agent, each Representative for any
Derivatives Creditor and the Finance Parties agree (or shall agree) to provide
upon request of the Collateral Agent) of the outstanding Senior Obligations or
Derivatives Obligations owed to the Agents, the Lenders or the Derivatives
Creditors, as the case may be. Unless it has actual knowledge (including by way
of written notice from a Derivatives Creditor or any Representatives thereof) to
the contrary, the Collateral Agent, in acting hereunder, shall be entitled to
assume that no Derivatives Agreements are in existence.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

            SECTION 9.01 APPOINTMENT; AUTHORIZATION.

            (a)   Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints
Merrill Lynch Capital as Administrative Agent and as Collateral Agent and
JPMorgan Chase Bank as Syndication Agent for such Lender to act as specified
herein and in the other Senior Finance Documents, and each such Lender hereby
authorizes the Agents, as the agents for such Lender, to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Senior Finance
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated by the terms hereof and of the other Senior Finance Documents,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any

                                     -123-

<PAGE>

provision to the contrary elsewhere herein and in the other Senior Finance
Documents, the Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein and therein, or any fiduciary relationship with
any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any of the other
Senior Finance Documents, or shall otherwise exist against the Agents. In
performing its functions and duties under this Agreement and the other Senior
Finance Documents, each Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Lenders and
does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or
relationship of agency or trust with or for any Credit Party. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing two sentences, the use of the term "agent"
herein and in the other Senior Finance Documents with reference to any Agent is
not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used
merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only
an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. The
provisions of this Article IX (other than Section 9.10) are solely for the
benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and none of the Credit Parties shall have
any rights as a third party beneficiary of the provisions hereof (other than
Section 9.10).

            (b)   Release of Collateral. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the
Collateral Agent, at the Collateral Agent's option and in its discretion, to
release any security interest in or Lien on any Collateral granted to or held by
the Collateral Agent (i) upon termination of this Agreement and the other Senior
Finance Documents, termination of the Commitments and all Letters of Credit and
payment in full of all Senior Obligations, including all fees and indemnified
costs and expenses that are payable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Finance
Documents, (ii) if such Collateral constitutes property sold or to be sold or
disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement or (iii) if approved by the Required Lenders or
Lenders, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Section 10.03. Upon the request
of the Collateral Agent, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral
Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to
this Section 9.01(b).

            (c)   Release of Guarantors. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent, at the Administrative Agent's option and in its
discretion, to release any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder if (i) such
Guarantor is no longer required to be a Guarantor pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) if approved by the Required Lenders or Lenders, as applicable,
pursuant to the terms of Section 10.03. Upon the request of the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority
to release a particular Guarantor pursuant to this Section 9.01(c).

            (d)   HLT Classification. Each Lender recognizes that applicable
Laws may require the Administrative Agent to determine whether the transactions
contemplated hereby should be classified as "highly leveraged" or assigned any
similar or successor classification, and that such determination may be binding
upon the other Lenders. Each Lender understands that any such determination
shall be made solely by the Administrative Agent based upon such factors (which
may include the Administrative Agent's internal policies and prevailing market
practices) as the Administrative Agent shall deem relevant and agrees that the
Administrative Agent shall have no liability for the consequences of any such
determination.

            SECTION 9.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. An Agent may execute any of its
duties hereunder or under the other Senior Finance Documents by or through
agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. An Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in the absence of bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                                     -124-

<PAGE>

            SECTION 9.03 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. No Agent nor any of its or
their directors, officers, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection herewith or in connection with any of the other Senior Finance
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (except for its own
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties
expressly set forth herein) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the
Lenders or participants for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties made by any of the Credit Parties contained herein or in any of the
other Senior Finance Documents or in any certificate, report, document,
financial statement or other written or oral statement referred to or provided
for in, or received by an Agent under or in connection herewith or in connection
with the other Senior Finance Documents, or enforceability or sufficiency
therefor of any of the other Senior Finance Documents, or for any failure of any
Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder or be required
to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained herein or therein or
as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of the Letters of Credit
or of the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default or
to inspect the properties, books or records of the Credit Parties.

            SECTION 9.04 RELIANCE ON COMMUNICATIONS. The Agents shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex, teletype or e-mail message, statement, order or other
document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to any of
the Credit Parties, independent accountants and other experts selected by the
Agents). The Agents may deem and treat each Lender as the owner of its interests
hereunder for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent in
accordance with Section 10.06(b). The Agents shall be fully justified in failing
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or under any of the other
Senior Finance Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. The Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or
in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any of the other Senior Finance
Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or to the extent
specifically provided in Section 10.03, all the Lenders) and such request and
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all
the Lenders (including their successors and assigns). Where this Agreement
expressly permits or prohibits an action unless the Required Lenders otherwise
determine, any Agent shall, and in all other instances an Agent may, but shall
not be required to, initiate any solicitation for the consent or vote of the
Lenders.

            SECTION 9.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. An Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest
and fees required to be paid to such Agent for the accounts of the Lenders,
unless such Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
the Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". If an Agent receives such a notice, such Agent
shall give prompt notice thereof to each other Agent and the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by
the Required Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking
such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default or it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

<PAGE>

            SECTION 9.06 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent has made
any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereinafter
taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of
the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender as to any
matter, including whether any Agent has disclosed material information in its
possession. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, financial and
other condition, prospects and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties, and all
requirements of Law pertaining to the Transaction, and made its own decision to
make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other
Senior Finance Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and
other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other
Credit Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder,
the Agents shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with
any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, assets,
property, financial or other conditions, prospects or creditworthiness of any
Credit Party or their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession
of any Agent.

            SECTION 9.07 NO RELIANCE ON ARRANGER'S OR AGENT'S CUSTOMER
IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such
Lender nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees may rely on either
Lead Arranger or any Agent to carry out such Lender's, Affiliate's,
participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or other
obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the U.S. Patriot Act or the
regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 C.F.R. 103.121
(as hereafter amended or replaced, the "CIP Regulations"), or any other
Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items
relating to or in connection with any of the Credit Parties, their Affiliates or
agents, the Senior Finance Documents or the transactions hereunder or
contemplated hereby: (i) any identification procedures; (ii) and recordkeeping;
(iii) comparisons with government lists, (iv) customer notices; or (v) other
procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other Laws.

            SECTION 9.08 INDEMNIFICATION. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or any other Credit Party and
without limiting the obligation of the Borrower or any other Credit Party to do
so), ratably according to their respective Commitments (or if the Commitments
have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal
amounts of outstanding Loans and Participation Interests of the Lenders), from
and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities which may at any time (including
without limitation at any time following payment in full of the Senior
Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against an Agent in its
capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
other Senior Finance Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by an Agent under or in connection with any of the
foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent
of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's
gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken
in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section
9.08. If any indemnity furnished to an Agent for any purpose shall, in the
opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call
for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional

                                     -126-

<PAGE>

indemnity is furnished. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall
reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other
Senior Finance Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein,
to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses
by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Credit Party. The agreements in
this Section 9.08 shall survive the payment of the Senior Obligations and all
other obligations and amounts payable hereunder and under the other Senior
Finance Documents.

            SECTION 9.09 AGENTS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Each Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire Equity Interests in, and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting and other business with the
Borrower or any other Credit Party as though such Agent were not an Agent
hereunder or under another Senior Finance Document. The Lenders acknowledge
that, pursuant to any such activities, an Agent or its Affiliates may receive
information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including information
that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Credit Party
or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that no Agent shall be under any obligation
to provide such information to them. With respect to the Loans made by and
Letters of Credit issued by and all obligations owing to it, an Agent shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise
the same as though it was not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

            SECTION 9.10 SUCCESSOR AGENTS. Any Agent may, at any time, resign
upon 30 days' written notice to the Lenders. If an Agent resigns under a Senior
Finance Document, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor Agent, which successor Agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at
all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent
of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have
accepted such appointment prior to the effective date of the resignation of the
resigning Agent, then the resigning Agent shall have the right, after consulting
with the Lenders and the Borrower, to appoint a successor Agent; provided such
successor is a Lender hereunder or an Eligible Assignee. If no successor Agent
is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the resigning
Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders
and the Borrower, a successor Agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance
of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations as an Agent, as appropriate, under
this Agreement and the other Senior Finance Documents and the provisions of this
Section 9.10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement. If no successor
Administrative Agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent within 60
days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, the
retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for above. Likewise, if no successor Collateral
Agent has accepted appointment as Collateral Agent within 60 days after the
retiring Collateral Agent's giving notice of resignation, the retiring
Collateral Agent's resignation shall nevertheless become effective and the
Lenders shall perform all duties of the Collateral Agent under the Collateral
Documents until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Collateral Agent as provided for above.

            SECTION 9.11 CERTAIN OTHER AGENTS. None of the Lenders identified on
the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent",
"documentation agent", "co-agent", "bookrunner", "lead manager" or "arranger"
shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under
the Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without
limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or any such Person so identified
shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship to any Lender or
Credit Party. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not
rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter
into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

            SECTION 9.12 AGENTS' FEES; ARRANGER FEE. The Borrower shall pay to
the Administrative Agent for its own account, to the Collateral Agent for its
own account and to the Lead Arrangers, in their capacity as Lead Arrangers, for
their own account, fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the
Lead Arrangers, respectively, in each case with respect to this Agreement, the
other Senior Finance Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

delivered by electronic mail in an Adobe PDF document. The effectiveness of any
such documents and signatures shall, subject to requirements of Law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all
Credit Parties, the Agents and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also

any facsimile document, Adobe PDF document or signature.

            (c)   Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Except as expressly provided
herein or as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion,

            (d)   Reliance by Agents and Lenders. The Agents and the Lenders
shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices purportedly given by or on
behalf of the Borrower or any other Credit Party even if (i) such notices were

followed by any other form of notice specified herein or (ii) the terms thereof,
as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The

            SECTION 10.02 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure or delay on
the part of an Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder or under any other Senior Finance Document and no course of dealing
between the Agents or any Lender and any of the Credit Parties shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under any other Senior Finance Document preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Agents or any
Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any
case shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Agents or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances
without notice or demand.

            SECTION 10.03 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Neither this
Agreement nor any other Senior Finance Document nor any of the terms hereof or
thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated except, in the
case of this Agreement pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by Holdings, the Borrower, and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Senior Finance Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower, any other Credit Parties party thereto
and the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, party

Required Lenders to waive any Event of Default prior to the time the
Administrative Agent shall have declared, or the Required Lenders shall have
requested the Administrative Agent to declare, the Loans immediately due and
payable pursuant to Article VIII and (ii) the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower may, with the consent of the other, amend, modify or supplement this
Agreement and any other Senior Finance Document to cure any ambiguity,

supplement does not adversely affect the rights of any Agent, any Lender or any
Issuing Lender; provided, however, that:

                  (i)   no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or
      termination shall, without the consent of each Lender directly affected
      thereby:

                        (A)   extend the final maturity of any Loan or the time
            of payment of any reimbursement obligation, or any portion thereof,

            Lenders to waive any Event of Default (other than an Event of
            Default the waiver of which would effectively result in any such
            extension or waiver), prior to the time the Administrative Agent
            shall have declared, or the Required Lenders shall have requested
            the Administrative Agent to declare, the Loans immediately due and

                        (B)   reduce the rate, or extend the time of payment, of
            interest on any Loan (other than as a result of waiving the
            applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates)

            any Default or Event of Default or a mandatory reduction in the
            Commitments shall not constitute a change in the terms of any
            Commitment of any Lender);

deliver such notice, only upon the direction of the Required Lenders.

            Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (i) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans or the Letters of Credit, and each Lender acknowledges
that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the
unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and (ii) the Required Lenders may
consent to allow a Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

            The various requirements of this Section 10.03 are cumulative. Each
Lender and each holder of a Note shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or
modification authorized by this Section 10.03 regardless of whether its Note

subsequently acquiring a Note from it, whether or not such Note shall have been
so marked.

severally, agree (i) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

with the enforcement, attempted enforcement or preservation of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or the other Senior Finance Documents (including
all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in
respect of the Senior Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any
proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding), including all
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (including the allocated charges of
internal counsel), provided that the Borrower shall not be required to reimburse
the legal fees and expenses of more than one outside counsel (in addition to up
to one local counsel in each applicable local jurisdiction) for all Persons
indemnified under this clause (ii) unless, in the written opinion of outside
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower, representation of all such
indemnified persons would be inappropriate due to the existence of an actual or
potential conflict of interest. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include
all search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees
and taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any
Agent and the cost of independent public accountants and other outside experts

Section 10.04 shall survive the termination of the Commitments and repayment of
all Senior Obligations.

            SECTION 10.05 INDEMNIFICATION. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, Holdings and the Borrower jointly and
severally agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless each Agent, each Lender and

successors and assignors (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from and against: (i)
any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action that are asserted
against any Indemnitee by any Person (other than the Administrative Agent or any
Lender) relating directly or indirectly to a claim, demand, action or cause of
action that such Person asserts or may assert against any Credit Party, any
Affiliate of any Credit Party or any of their respective officers or directors;
(ii) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action that may at any
time (including at any time following repayment of the Senior Obligations and
the resignation or removal of

                                     -131-

any Agent or the replacement of any Lender) be asserted or imposed against any
Indemnitee, arising out of or relating to, the Senior Finance Documents, any
predecessor Senior Finance Documents, the Commitments, the use of or
contemplated use of the proceeds of any Credit Extension, or the relationship of

liabilities (including liabilities under indemnities), losses, costs or expenses
(including fees and disbursements of counsel) that any Indemnitee suffers or
incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action,

proceeding, in all cases, and whether or not an Indemnitee is a party to such
claim, demand, action, cause of action, or proceeding (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that no Indemnitee shall
be entitled to indemnification for any claim to the extent such claim is

judgment to have been caused by its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct and provided further that Holdings and the Borrower shall not be
required to reimburse the legal fees and expenses of more than one outside
counsel (in addition to up to one local counsel in each applicable local
jurisdiction) for all Indemnities unless, in the written opinion of outside
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower, representation of all such
Indemnitees would be inappropriate due to the existence of an actual or
potential conflict of interest. In the case of an investigation, litigation or
other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 10.05 applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Credit Party, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnitee or any other Person or any Indemnitee is otherwise a
party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated. Each of Holdings and the Borrower agrees not to assert or permit
any of their respective Subsidiaries to assert any claim against any Agent, any
Lender, any of their Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, agents and advisers, and each of the Agents and the
Lenders agrees not to assert or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to

Lender and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of
each Lender and to (ii) retain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 10.06. Failure to
make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect
the Borrower's obligation in respect of such Loans. The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders shall treat each
Person in whose name a Loan and the Note evidencing the same is registered as
the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice or
any provision herein to the contrary. With respect to any Lender, the assignment
or other transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the
principal of, and interest on, any Loan made and any Note issued pursuant to
this Agreement shall not be effective until such assignment or other transfer is
recorded on the Register and, except to the extent provided in this subsection
10.06(d), otherwise complies with Section 10.06, and prior to such recordation
all amounts owing to the transferring Lender with respect to such Commitments,
Loans and Notes shall remain owing to the transferring Lender. The registration
of assignment or other transfer of all or part of any Commitments, Loans and
Notes for a Lender shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register
only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and
delivered Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the administrative fee
referred to in Section 10.06(b)(iv). The Register shall be available at the
offices where kept by the Administrative Agent for inspection by the Borrower
and any Lender at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to the
Administrative Agent. The Borrower

subsection 10.06(d) have been satisfied.

            (e)   Participations. Each Lender may, without the consent of the

participations to one or more Persons in all or a portion of its rights,
obligations or rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Loans, its Notes, its Commitments and any Participation Interest

(i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (iii) the participant shall be entitled to the
benefit of the right of setoff contained in Section 10.08 and the yield
protection provisions contained in Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 and to the same
extent that the Lender from which such participant acquired its participation
would be entitled to the benefits of such yield protection provisions; provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to reimburse any participant pursuant to
Sections 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 in an amount which exceeds the amount that would
have been payable thereunder to such Lender had such Lender not sold such
participation and (iv) the Credit Parties, the Agents, the Issuing Lenders, the
Swingline Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce the obligations of the Credit Parties relating to the Senior Obligations
owing to such Lender and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications or waivers

on such Loans or Notes, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date
fixed for the payment of interest on such Loans or Notes or extending its
Commitment).

            (f)   Other Assignments. Any Lender may at any time (i) assign all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Notes to a Federal
Reserve Bank, (ii) pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of

securities issued, by such Lender as collateral security for such obligations or
securities, or to any trustee for, or any other representative of such holders)
and (iii) grant to an SPC referred to in subsection (h) below identified as such
in writing from time to time by such Lender to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loans that
such Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement; provided that no such assignment, option, pledge or security
interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such Federal Reserve Bank or other Person to which such option,
pledge or assignment has been made for such Lender as a party hereto.

            (g)   Information. Any Lender may furnish any information concerning
any Credit Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries in the possession of
such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including
prospective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the provisions of

special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") the option to fund all or any part of
any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant
to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise
such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the
Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms
hereof, (iii) no SPC shall have any voting rights pursuant to Section 10.01 and
(iv) with respect to notices, payments and other matters hereunder, the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated to
deal with an SPC, but may limit their communications and other dealings relevant
to such SPC to the

                                     -135-

<PAGE>

applicable Granting Lender. The funding of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
utilize the Revolving Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent that,
and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto
hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under
this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and
to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such
payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating
to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or
provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC. This subsection (h) may not be
amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any
part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment.

            SECTION 10.07 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE. (a) Each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i)
to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees, trustees and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood
that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential); (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority (in
which case the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall use
reasonable efforts to notify the "Borrower prior to such disclosure); (iii) to
the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; (iv) to any other party to this Agreement; (v) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder;
(vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section 10.07, to (A) any Eligible Assignee of or participant in,
or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or (B) any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or
prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative
transaction relating to obligations of the Borrower; (vii) with the consent of
the Borrower; (viii) to the extent such information (A) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.07 or (B)
becomes available to an Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than the Borrower; or (ix) to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or any other similar organization or any nationally recognized
rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's or its
Affiliates' investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect
to such Lender or its Affiliates. For the purposes of this Section 10.07,
"Information" means all information received from the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or their respective
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates; provided that, in the case
of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section 10.07 shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Agent and
any Lender may place advertisements in financial and other newspapers and
periodicals or on a home page or similar place for dissemination of information
on the Internet or worldwide web as it may choose, and circulate similar
promotional materials, after the closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in the form of a "tombstone" or otherwise describing the names of
the Credit Parties, or any of them, and the amount, type and closing date of
such transactions, all at their sole expense.

            (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other contrary provision
in this Agreement or any other Senior Finance Documents, the parties hereto
hereby agree that, from the commencement of discussions with respect to the
Transactions and the Senior Finance Documents, each of the parties hereto

                                     -136-

<PAGE>

and each of their respective employees, representatives and other agents may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure (as such terms are used in Sections 6011, 6111 and
6112 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of the
Senior Finance Documents and the Transaction and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any of the
parties hereto relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, other than any
information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply
with applicable securities laws; provided, however, that for this purpose the
U.S. federal income tax treatment and U.S. federal income tax structure shall
not include (i) the identity of any existing or future party (or affiliate of
such party) to this Agreement or (ii) any specific market pricing information,
including the amount of any fees, expenses, rates or payments, arising in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

            SECTION 10.08 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any
such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is authorized at any time and
from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind (all of such rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to
appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or specific, but excluding
Exempt Deposit Accounts as defined in the Security Agreement) and any other
indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including, without
limitation, branches, agencies or Affiliates of such Lender wherever located) to
or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against obligations and
liabilities of such Credit Party then due to the Lenders hereunder, under the
Notes, under the other Senior Finance Documents or otherwise, and any such
set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default even though such charge is made or entered on the books of such
Lender subsequent thereto. The Credit Parties hereby agree that to the extent
permitted by law any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans, Commitments
and LC Obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 2.01(c), 2.05(a) or (e), 2.13
or 10.06(e) may exercise all rights of set-off with respect to its participation
interest as fully as if such Person were a Lender hereunder and any such set-off
shall reduce the amount owed by such Credit Party to the Lender.

            SECTION 10.09 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the "Charges"), shall exceed
the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be charged or contracted
for, charged or otherwise received by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance
with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section 10.09, shall be cumulated and the
interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods
shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such Lender
shall have received such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Rate to the date of payment.

            SECTION 10.10 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account
for more than one such counterpart.

            SECTION 10.11 INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other
Senior Finance Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the
parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Senior
Finance Document,

                                     -137-

<PAGE>

the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders in any other Senior Finance Document shall not be deemed a conflict with
this Agreement. Each Senior Finance Document was drafted with the joint
participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither
against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair
meaning thereof.

            SECTION 10.12 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Senior Finance
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection
herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and
thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by
the Agents and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or
any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time
of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as
any Loan or any other Senior Obligation shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or
any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

            SECTION 10.13 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement and the
other Senior Finance Documents to which any Credit Party is a party that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

            SECTION 10.14 HEADINGS. The headings of the sections and subsections
hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

            SECTION 10.15 DEFAULTING LENDERS. Each Lender understands and agrees
that if such Lender is a Defaulting Lender then, notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 10.03, it shall not be entitled to vote on any matter requiring the
consent of the Required Lenders or to object to any matter requiring the consent
of all the Lenders adversely affected thereby; provided, however, that all other
benefits and obligations under the Senior Finance Documents shall apply to such
Defaulting Lender, except as provided in Section 2.03(e).

            SECTION 10.16 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

            (a)   THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER SENIOR FINANCE DOCUMENTS (OTHER
THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SUCH OTHER
SENIOR FINANCE DOCUMENTS) AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK), WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. EACH LETTER OF CREDIT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OR
RULES DESIGNATED IN SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT, OR IF NO SUCH LAWS OR RULES ARE
DESIGNATED, THE UNIFORM CUSTOMS AND PRACTICE FOR DOCUMENTARY CREDITS (1993
REVISION), INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, PUBLICATION NO. 500 AND, AS TO
MATTERS NOT GOVERNED BY SUCH UNIFORM CUSTOMS, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL
OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK), WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF

                                     -138-

<PAGE>

LAWS PRINCIPLES. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement
or any other Senior Finance Document may be brought in the courts of the State
of New York in New York County, or of the United States for the Southern
District of New York and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect
of its property, generally and unconditional, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of
such courts. Each of Holdings and the Borrower irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such court and
any claim that any such proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

            (b)   Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably consents
and agrees that any and all process which may be served in any suit, action or
proceeding of the nature referred to in this Section 10.16 may be served by the
mailing of a copy thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to Holdings' or the Borrower's address referred to in
Section 10.03, as the case may be. Each of Holdings and the Borrower agrees that
such service (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process
upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and
personal delivery to it. Nothing in this Section 10.16 shall affect the right of
any Lender to serve process in any manner permitted by law or limit the right of
any Lender to bring proceedings against Holdings or the Borrower in the courts
of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions.

            SECTION 10.17 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY SENIOR FINANCE DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR
ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY SENIOR FINANCE DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES
AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

            SECTION 10.18 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall become effective
at such time when it shall have been executed by Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall have received copies
hereof (telefaxed or otherwise) which, when taken together, bear the signatures
of each Lender, and thereafter this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Borrower, each Agent and
each Lender and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
unless the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 have been satisfied by the
Credit Parties or waived by the Lenders on or before April 2, 2004, none of
Holdings, the Borrower, the Agents or the Lenders shall have any obligations
under this Agreement.

            SECTION 10.19 LENDERS' U.S. PATRIOT ACT COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATION.
Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated
under the Laws of the United States or a State thereof (and is not excepted from
the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the U.S.

                                     -139-

Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an Affiliate

in the United States or foreign country and (ii) subject to supervision by a
banking regulatory authority regulating such affiliated depository institution
or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification or,
if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Lender is not a "shell" and
certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the U.S. Patriot Act

            SECTION 10.20 U.S. PATRIOT ACT NOTICE. Each Senior Finance Party
(for itself and not on behalf of any other Senior Finance Party) hereby notifies
each of Holdings and the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S.
Patriot Act, such Senior Finance Party is required to obtain, verify and record
