         causes the current sole member, CDW REALCO, Inc., a Delaware
         corporation ("Borrower's Sole Member") to cease to be the member of
         Borrower (other than (1) upon an assignment by Borrower's Sole Member
         of all of its limited liability company interest in Borrower and the
         admission of the transferee in accordance with the Loan Documents and
         the LLC Agreement, or (2) the resignation of Borrower's Sole Member and
         the admission of an additional member of Borrower in accordance with
         the terms of the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement), any person
         acting as Independent Director of Borrower shall, without any action of
         any other Person and simultaneously with Borrower's Sole Member ceasing

         upon the admission to Borrower of a substitute Member, (w) Special
         Member shall be a member of Borrower that has no interest in the

         right to vote on, approve or otherwise consent to any action by, or
         matter relating to, Borrower, including, without limitation, the

         such prohibition shall not limit the obligations of Special Member, in
         its capacity as Independent Director, to vote on such matters known as

         admission to Borrower as Special Member, Special Member shall not be a
         member of Borrower. Upon the occurrence of any event that causes
         Borrower's Sole Member to cease to be a member of Borrower, to the
         fullest extent permitted by law, the personal representative of
         Borrower's Sole Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the

         designee, as the case may be, as a substitute member of Borrower,
         effective as of the occurrence of the event that terminated the
         continued membership of Borrower's Sole Member in Borrower. Any action
         initiated by or brought against Borrower's Sole Member or Special
         Member under any Creditors Rights Laws shall not cause Borrower's Sole
         Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of Borrower and upon
         the occurrence of such an event, the business of

                                      -21-

         Borrower shall continue without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall
         provide that both Borrower's Sole Member and Special Member waive any
         right it might have to agree in writing to dissolve Borrower upon the
         occurrence of any action initiated by or brought against Borrower's
         Sole Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws, or the

II.      GENERAL TERMS

         SECTION 2.1 LOAN COMMITMENT; DISBURSEMENT TO BORROWER.

         2.1.1 AGREEMENT TO LEND AND BORROW. Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Lender hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby
agrees to accept the Loan on the Closing Date.

         2.1.2 SINGLE DISBURSEMENT TO BORROWER. Borrower may request and receive
only one (1) borrowing hereunder in respect of the Loan and any amount borrowed
and repaid hereunder in respect of the Loan may not be reborrowed.

         2.1.3 THE NOTE, MORTGAGE AND LOAN DOCUMENTS. The Loan shall be
evidenced by the Note and secured by the Mortgages, the Assignments of Leases
and the other Loan Documents.

         2.1.4 USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to
(a)acquire the Properties or repay and discharge any existing loans relating to
the Properties, (b) pay all past-due Basic Carrying Costs, if any, with respect
to the Properties, (c) make deposits into the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date
in the amounts provided herein, (d) pay costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the closing of the Loan, as approved by Lender, (e) fund any
working capital requirements of the Properties and (f) for general corporate
purposes not inconsistent with the terms of the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 2.2 INTEREST RATE.

         2.2.1 INTEREST RATE. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of
the Loan shall accrue from the Closing Date to but excluding the Maturity Date.

         2.2.2 INTEREST CALCULATION. Interest on the outstanding principal
balance of the Loan shall be calculated by multiplying (a) the actual number of
days elapsed in the period for which the calculation is being made by (b) a
daily rate based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year by (c) the outstanding
principal balance.

         2.2.3 DEFAULT RATE. In the event that, and for so long as, any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the outstanding principal balance
of the Loan and, to the extent permitted by law, all accrued and unpaid interest

shall accrue interest at the Default Rate,

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

calculated from the date such payment was due without regard to any grace or
cure periods contained herein.

         2.2.4 USURY SAVINGS. This Agreement, the Note and the other Loan
Documents are subject to the express condition that at no time shall Borrower be
obligated or required to pay interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a
rate which could subject Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a
result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the terms of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any time required or
obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder at a rate in
excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the
case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate
and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to
have been payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest
due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use,
forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread
throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the
rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum
Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan
for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

         SECTION 2.3 LOAN PAYMENT.

         2.3.1 MONTHLY DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS. Borrower shall pay to Lender (a)
on the first Payment Date following the Closing Date, an amount equal to
interest only on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan from the Closing
Date up to but not including such Payment Date (unless such Closing Date is the
first (1st) day of the month, in which case no such interest only payment shall
be due) and (b) on each Payment Date thereafter up to and including the Maturity
Date, Borrower shall make a payment to Lender of principal and interest in an
amount equal to the Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount, which payments shall be
applied first to accrued and unpaid interest and the balance to principal.

         2.3.2 PAYMENTS GENERALLY. The first (1st) interest accrual period
hereunder shall commence on and include the Closing Date and shall end on and
include the last date of the month in which the Closing Date occurs. Each
interest accrual period thereafter shall commence on the first (1st) day of each
calendar month during the term of this Agreement and shall end on and include
the final calendar date of such calendar month. For purposes of making payments
hereunder, but not for purposes of calculating interest accrual periods, if the
day on which such payment is due is not a Business Day, then amounts due on such
date shall be due on the immediately succeeding Business Day and with respect to
payments of principal due on the Maturity Date, interest shall be payable at the
Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, through and including the
day immediately preceding such Maturity Date. All amounts due under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be payable without setoff,
counterclaim, defense or any other deduction whatsoever.

         2.3.3 PAYMENT ON MATURITY DATE. Borrower shall pay to Lender on the
Maturity Date the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, all accrued and
unpaid interest and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Note, the
Mortgages and the other Loan Documents.

         2.3.4 LATE PAYMENT CHARGE. If any principal, interest or any other
sums due under the Loan Documents (including the amounts due on the Maturity
Date) are not paid by Borrower on or prior to the date on which it is due,
Borrower shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of five
percent (5%) of such unpaid sum or the Maximum Legal Rate in order to defray the
expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent payment
and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment. Any
such amount shall be secured by the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents to
the extent permitted by applicable law.

         2.3.5 METHOD AND PLACE OF PAYMENT. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all payments and prepayments under this Agreement and the Note
shall be made to Lender not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
date when due and shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America
in immediately available funds at Lender's office or as otherwise directed by
Lender, and any funds received by Lender after such time shall, for all
purposes hereof, be deemed to have been paid on the next succeeding Business
Day.

         SECTION 2.4 PREPAYMENTS.

         2.4.1 VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. (a) Except as otherwise provided this
Section 2.4, Borrower shall not have the right to prepay the Loan in whole or in
part prior to the Maturity Date.

         2.4.2 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. On the next occurring Payment Date
following the date on which Lender actually receives any Net Proceeds, if Lender
is not obligated to make such Net Proceeds available to Borrower for the
Restoration of any Individual Property, Borrower shall prepay or authorize
Lender to apply such Net Proceeds as a prepayment of all or a portion of the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan together with accrued interest and any
other sums due hereunder in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
such Net Proceeds; provided, however, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Lender may apply such Net Proceeds to the Debt (until paid in full)
in any order or priority in its sole discretion. Other than following an Event
of Default, no Yield Maintenance Premium shall be due in connection with any
prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.4.2. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, provided that an Event of Default has not occurred
and is continuing, any partial prepayment under this Section shall be applied to
the last payments of principal due under the Loan.

         2.4.3 PREPAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT. If following an Event of Default,
payment of all or any part of the Debt is tendered by Borrower or otherwise
recovered by Lender, such tender or recovery shall be (a) made on the next
occurring Payment Date together with the Monthly Debt Service Payment and (b)
deemed a voluntary prepayment by Borrower in violation of the prohibition
against prepayment set forth in Section 2.4.1 hereof and Borrower shall pay, in
addition to the Debt, an amount equal to the Yield Maintenance Premium.

         2.4.4 PREPAYMENTS PRIOR TO PREPAYMENT RELEASE DATE. Prior to the
Permitted Release Date and if a Securitization has not occurred, Lender may, in
its sole discretion, permit Borrower to prepay the Loan in part in order to
obtain the release of an Individual Property from

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

the Lien of the Mortgage thereon, provided, that (i) no Event of Default exists;
(ii) the requirements of Section 6 have been satisfied; (iii) Borrower pays
Lender, in addition to the Adjusted Release Amount for the applicable Individual
Property, (A) all interest which would have accrued on such Adjusted Release
Amount through and including the last day of the Interest Period related to the
Payment Date next occurring following the date of such prepayment, or, if such
prepayment occurs on a Payment Date, through and including the last day of the
Interest Period related to such Payment Date, (B) all other sums then due and
payable under this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents, including,
but not limited to all of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender in connection
with such prepayment, and (C) an amount equal to twenty-five hundredths of one
percent (0.25%) of such Adjusted Release Amount.

         2.4.5 OTHER PREPAYMENTS.

         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but provided no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall be permitted to
prepay the Loan in full at any time on or following the Payment Date occurring
immediately prior to the Maturity Date, together with any interest which would
have accrued on the date such prepayment was made through and including the
Maturity Date. Other than following an Event of Default, no Yield Maintenance
Premium shall be due in connection with any prepayment made pursuant to this
Section 2.4.5.

         SECTION 2.5 DEFEASANCE.

         2.5.1 VOLUNTARY DEFEASANCE. (a) Provided no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall have the right at any time after the
Permitted Release Date to voluntarily defease all, or in connection with a
release of an Individual Property in accordance with Section 2.5.5 hereof, any
portion of the Loan by and upon satisfaction of the following conditions (such
event being a "DEFEASANCE EVENT"):

               (i)    Borrower shall provide not less than thirty (30) days
         prior written notice to Lender specifying the Payment Date (the

         the release of a Property in accordance with Section 2.5.5 hereof, and
         the principal amount of the Loan to be defeased;

               (ii)   Borrower shall pay to Lender all accrued and unpaid
         interest on the principal balance of the Loan to and including the
         Defeasance Date;

               (iii)  Borrower shall pay to Lender all other sums, not including

         applicable to the Defeasance Event;

               (v)    In the event only a portion of the Loan is the subject of
         the Defeasance Event, Borrower shall prepare all necessary documents to
         modify this Agreement and to amend and restate the Note and issue two
         substitute notes, one

                                      -27-

         "DEFEASED NOTE") and the other note having a principal balance equal to
         the undefeased portion of the Note (the "UNDEFEASED NOTE"). The
         Defeased Note and Undefeased Note shall otherwise have terms identical
         to the Note, except that a Defeased Note cannot be the subject of any
         further Defeasance Event;

                  (vi)   Borrower shall execute and deliver a pledge and
         security agreement, in form and substance that would be reasonably

         transferred and assigned the U.S. Obligations and all obligations,
         rights and duties under and to the Note or the Defeased Note (as
         applicable) to the Successor Borrower, that Lender has a perfected
         first priority security interest in the Defeasance Deposit and the U.S.
         Obligations delivered by Borrower and that any REMIC Trust formed
         pursuant to a Securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a
         "real estate mortgage investment conduit" within the meaning of Section
         860D of the Code as a result of such Defeasance Event;

                  (viii) Borrower shall deliver confirmation in writing from
         each of the applicable Rating Agencies to the effect that such release
         will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
         respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such Defeasance Event
         for the Securities issued in connection with the Securitization which
         are then outstanding. If required by the applicable Rating Agencies,

         substance satisfactory to Lender and the applicable Rating Agencies;

                  (ix)   Borrower shall deliver an Officer's Certificate

         independent certified public accountant certifying that the U.S.
         Obligations purchased with the Defeasance Deposit generate monthly
         amounts equal to or greater than the Scheduled Defeasance Payments;

                  (xi)   Borrower shall deliver such other certificates,
          documents or instruments as Lender may reasonably request; and

                  (xii)  Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses of Lender
         incurred in connection with the Defeasance Event, including (A) any

         2.5.3 hereof, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in
         connection with the Defeasance Event, (C) the costs and expenses of the
         Rating Agencies, (D) any revenue, documentary stamp or intangible taxes
         or any other tax or charge due in connection with the transfer of the
         Note, or otherwise required to accomplish the defeasance and (E) the
         costs and expenses of Servicer and any trustee, including reasonable

         (b) In connection with each Defeasance Event, Borrower shall use the
Defeasance Deposit to purchase U.S. Obligations which provide payments on or
prior to, but as close as possible to, all successive scheduled payment dates
after the Defeasance Date upon which interest and principal payments are
required under the Note, in the case of a Defeasance Event for the entire
outstanding principal balance of the Loan, or the Defeased Note, in the case of
a Defeasance Event for only a portion of the outstanding principal balance of
the Loan, as applicable, and in amounts equal to the scheduled payments due on
such dates under this Agreement and the Note or the Defeased Note (as
applicable) (including, without limitation, scheduled payments of principal,
interest, servicing fees (if any), and any other amounts due under the Loan
Documents on such dates) and assuming the Note or the Defeased Note (as
applicable) is prepaid in full on the Maturity Date (the "SCHEDULED DEFEASANCE
PAYMENTS"). Borrower, pursuant to the Security Agreement or other appropriate
document, shall authorize and direct that the payments received from the U.S.
Obligations may be made directly to the Cash Management Account (unless
otherwise directed by Lender) and applied to satisfy the obligations of Borrower
under this Agreement and the Note or the Defeased Note (as applicable). Any
portion of the Defeasance Deposit in excess of the amount necessary to purchase
the U.S. Obligations required by this Section 2.5 and satisfy Borrower's other
obligations under this Section 2.5 and 2.5.3 shall be remitted to Borrower.

         2.5.2 COLLATERAL. Each of the U.S. Obligations that are part of the
defeasance collateral shall be duly endorsed by the holder thereof as directed
by Lender or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form and
substance that would be satisfactory to a prudent lender (including, without
limitation, such instruments as may be required by the depository institution
holding such securities or by the issuer thereof, as the case may be, to
effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the book-entry facilities of
such institution) in order to perfect upon the delivery of the defeasance
collateral a first priority security interest therein in favor of Lender in
conformity with all applicable state and federal laws governing the granting of
such security interests.

         2.5.3 SUCCESSOR BORROWER. In connection with any Defeasance Event,
Borrower may at its option, or if so required by the applicable Rating Agencies
shall, establish or designate a successor entity (the "SUCCESSOR BORROWER")
acceptable to Lender, which shall be a Special Purpose Entity with two (2)
Independent Directors approved by the Rating Agencies, and Borrower shall
transfer and assign all obligations, rights and duties under and to the Note or
the Defeased Note (as applicable), together with the pledged U.S. Obligations to
such Successor Borrower. Such Successor Borrower shall assume the obligations
under the Note or the Defeased Note (as applicable) and the Security Agreement
and Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations under such documents. Borrower
shall pay One Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000) to any such Successor
Borrower as consideration for assuming the obligations under the

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

Note or the Defeased Note (as applicable) and the Security Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no other assumption
fee shall be payable upon a transfer of the Note or the Defeased Note (as
applicable) in accordance with this Section 2.5.3, but Borrower shall pay all
costs and expenses incurred by Lender, including Lender's reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses and any fees and expenses of any Rating Agencies, incurred in
connection therewith.

         2.5.4 RELEASE OF PROPERTY.

         Except as set forth in this Section 2.5, no repayment, prepayment or
defeasance of all or any portion of the Loan shall cause, give rise to a right
to require, or otherwise result in, the release of any Lien of any Mortgage on
any Individual Property.

         2.5.5 RELEASE OF PROPERTY.

           (a) If Borrower has elected to defease all or a portion of the Loan
and the requirements of Section 2.5 have been satisfied, all of the Properties
to which the defeasance applies shall be released from the Liens of their
respective Mortgages.

           (b) In connection with the release of the Mortgages, Borrower shall
submit to Lender, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Defeasance Date,
a release of Lien (and related Loan Documents) for each Individual Property for
execution by Lender. Such release shall be in a form appropriate in each
jurisdiction in which an Individual Property is located and that would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender and contains standard provisions, if any,
protecting the rights of the releasing lender. In addition, Borrower shall
provide all other documentation Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by
Borrower in connection with such release, together with an Officer's
Certificate certifying that such documentation (i) is in compliance with all
Legal Requirements, and (ii) will effect such releases in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

         2.5.6 RELEASE OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY. If Borrower has elected to prepay
a portion of the Loan and the requirements of Section 2.5 have been satisfied,
and provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower
may obtain the release of an Individual Property from the Lien of the Mortgage
thereon (and related Loan Documents) and the release of Borrower's obligations
under the Loan Documents with respect to such Individual Property (other than
those expressly stated to survive), upon the satisfaction of each of the
following conditions:

           (a) The amount of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan to be
prepaid shall equal or exceed the Adjusted Release Amount for the applicable
Individual Property, and such prepayment shall be deemed a voluntary prepayment
for all purposes hereunder;

           (b) Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the Payment Date on which the prepayment will be made, a release of
Lien (and related Loan Documents) for such Individual Property for execution by
Lender. Such release shall be in a form appropriate in each jurisdiction in
which the Individual Property is located and that would be satisfactory to a
prudent lender and contains standard provisions, if any, protecting the rights
of the releasing lender. In addition, Borrower shall provide all other
documentation

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such
release, together with an Officer's Certificate certifying that such
documentation (i) is in compliance with all Legal Requirements, (ii) will effect
such release in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (iii) will not
impair or otherwise adversely affect the Liens, security interests and other
rights of Lender under the Loan Documents not being released (or as to the
parties to the Loan Documents and Properties subject to the Loan Documents not
being released);

           (c) After giving effect to such release (including the amount prepaid
in Section 2.5.2 above), (i) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Properties
then remaining subject to the Liens of the Mortgages following the release shall
equal or exceed the greater (a) 1.35 to 1.00 (based upon a calculation using
payments of Debt Service in excess of the payments used for the Defeased Note)
and (b) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all of the then remaining Properties
(including the Individual Property to be released) for the twelve (12) full
calendar months immediately preceding the release of the Individual Property and
(ii) the Loan to Value Ratio shall equal or be less than sixty-five percent
(65%), provided further that in the event that payment of the Adjusted Release
Amount for the applicable Individual Property does not result in a Loan to Value
Ratio sufficient to permit a release hereunder, Borrower shall have the option,
but not the obligation, of paying an additional sum in excess of the Adjusted
Release Amount sufficient to permit the required Loan to Value Ratio to be
attained; and

           (d) The Individual Property to be released shall be conveyed to a
Person other than a Borrower or any of its Affiliates.

         2.5.7 RELEASE ON PAYMENT IN FULL. Lender shall, upon the written
request and at the expense of Borrower, upon payment in full of all principal
and interest due on the Loan and all other amounts due and payable under the
Loan Documents in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Note and this
Agreement, release the Lien of the Mortgage on the Property.

         SECTION 2.6 CASH MANAGEMENT.

         2.6.1 CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT. (a) During the term of the Loan,
Borrower shall establish and maintain an account (the "CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT")
with Agent in the trust for the benefit of Lender, which Cash Management Account

Account shall be entitled "WESCO REAL ESTATE IV, LLC as Borrower and Bear
Stearns Commercial Mortgage, Inc., as Lender, pursuant to Loan Agreement dated
as of December 13, 2002 - Cash Management Account". Borrower hereby grants to
Lender a first-priority security interest in the Cash Management Account and all
deposits at any time contained therein and the proceeds thereof and will take
all actions necessary to maintain in favor of Lender a perfected first priority
security interest in the Cash Management Account, including, without limitation,
executing and filing UCC-1 Financing Statements and continuations thereof.
Lender and Servicer shall have the sole right to make withdrawals from the Cash
Management Account and all costs and expenses for establishing and maintaining
the Cash Management Account shall be paid by Borrower. All monies now or
hereafter deposited into the Cash Management Account shall be deemed additional
security for the Debt.

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

           (b) Borrower shall deliver an irrevocable written instruction to
WESCO Tenant and any other tenants under Leases pursuant to which some portion
of the WESCO Lease has been assigned in accordance with the terms hereof to
deliver all Rents payable thereunder directly to the Cash Management Account.
Borrower shall deposit all amounts received by Borrower constituting Rents into
the Cash Management Account within one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof.

           (c) Intentionally deleted.

           (d) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Trigger Event,
Lender may, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available to
Lender, apply any sums then present in the Cash Management Account to the
payment of the Debt in any order in its sole discretion.

           (e) The Cash Management Account shall be an Eligible Account and
shall not be commingled with other monies held by Borrower or Agent.

           (f) Borrower shall not further pledge, assign or grant any security
interest in the Cash Management Account or the monies deposited therein or
permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made
thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the
secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

           (g) Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from and
against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses,
damages, obligations and costs and expenses (including litigation costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected
with the Cash Management Account and/or the Cash Management Agreement (unless
arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender) or the
performance of the obligations for which the Cash Management Account was
established.

           (h) The insufficiency of funds on deposit in the Cash Management
Account shall not relieve Borrower from the obligation to make any payments, as
and when due pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and such
obligations shall be separate and independent, and not conditioned on any event
or circumstance whatsoever.

           (i) All funds on deposit in the Cash Management Account following the
occurrence of an Event of Default may be applied by Lender in such order and
priority as Lender shall determine.

         2.6.2 PAYMENTS RECEIVED UNDER THE CASH MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, and provided no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower's obligations with respect to the payment of the Monthly
Debt Service Payment Amount and amounts required to be deposited into the
Reserve Funds, if any, shall be deemed satisfied to the extent sufficient

         SECTION 2.7 SUBSTITUTION OF PROPERTIES.

         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.7,
Borrower may obtain a release of the Lien of a single Mortgage (and the related
Loan Documents) encumbering an Individual Property (a "SUBSTITUTED PROPERTY") by
substituting therefor another property of like kind and quality acquired by
Borrower, up to a maximum of four (4) times during the term of the Loan
(individually, a "SUBSTITUTE PROPERTY" and collectively, the "SUBSTITUTE
PROPERTIES"), provided that the following conditions precedent are satisfied:

           (a) the Maturity Date shall have not occurred.

           (b) Lender shall have received at least sixty (60) days prior written
notice requesting the substitution and identifying the Substitute Property and
Substituted Property.

           (c) Lender shall have received a copy of a deed conveying all of
Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Substituted Property to an
entity other than Borrower pursuant to an arms length transaction and a letter
from Borrower countersigned by a title insurance company acknowledging receipt
of such deed and agreeing to record such deed in the real estate records for the
county in which the Substituted Property is located.

           (d) Lender shall have received a fee in the amount of one percent
(1.0%) of the Pro-Rata Release Amount for the Substitute Property.

           (e) If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have
received an appraisal of the Substitute Property and Substituted Property, dated
no more than sixty (60) days prior to the substitution date, by an appraiser
acceptable to the Rating Agencies.

           (f) The fair market value of the Substitute Property is not less than
one hundred five percent (105%) of the greater of (A) the fair market value of
the Substituted Property as of the Closing Date and (B) the fair market value of
the Substituted Property as of the date immediately preceding the substitution,
which determination shall be made by (I) Lender in its sole discretion if the
Loan is not part of a Securitization and (II) Lender based on the appraisals
delivered pursuant to clause (e) above if the Loan is part of a Securitization.

           (g) After giving effect to the substitution, the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio for the Loan for all of the Properties (excluding the Substituted
Property and including the Substitute Property) is not less than the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for the Loan for all of the Properties as of the Closing
Date and as of the date immediately preceding the substitution.

           (h) The Substitute Property will be made subject to the WESCO Lease
providing for a rent payment no less than the payment for the Individual
Property that is being substituted.

           (i) If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have
received confirmation in writing from the Rating Agencies to the effect that
such substitution will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of
the respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such substitution for the
Securities, or any class thereof, issued in

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

connection with the Securitization that are then outstanding. If the Loan is not
part of a Securitization, Lender shall have consented in writing to such
substitution, which consent shall be given in Lender's sole discretion and not
unreasonably withheld.

         (j) No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and
Borrower shall be in compliance in all material respects with all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in each Loan Document on Borrower's
part to be observed or performed. Lender shall have received a certificate from
Borrower confirming the foregoing, stating that the representations and
warranties of Borrower contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of the
substitution with respect to Borrower, the Properties and the Substitute
Property and containing any other representations and warranties with respect to
Borrower, the Properties, the Substitute Property or the Loan as the Rating
Agencies may require, unless such certificate would be inaccurate, such
certificate to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Rating Agencies.

         (k) Borrower shall (A) have executed, acknowledged and delivered to
Lender (I) a Mortgage, an Assignment of Leases and Rents and two UCC-1 Financing
Statements with respect to the Substitute Property, together with a letter from
Borrower countersigned by a title insurance company acknowledging receipt of
such Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents and UCC-1 Financing Statements and
agreeing to record or file, as applicable, such Mortgage, Assignment of Leases
and Rents and one of the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the real estate records
for the county in which the Substitute Property is located and to file one of
the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the office of the Secretary of State (or other
central filing office) of the state in which the Substitute Property is located,
so as to effectively create upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable
Liens upon the Substitute Property, of the requisite priority, in favor of
Lender (or such other trustee as may be desired under local law), subject only
to the Permitted Encumbrances and such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to
the Loan Documents and (II) an Environmental Indemnity with respect to the
Substitute Property and (B) have caused the Guarantor to acknowledge and confirm
its respective obligations under the Loan Documents. The Mortgage, Assignment of
Leases and Rents, UCC-1 Financing Statements and Environmental Indemnity shall
be the same in form and substance as the counterparts of such documents executed
and delivered with respect to the related Substituted Property subject to
modifications reflecting only the Substitute Property as the Individual Property
that is the subject of such documents and such modifications reflecting the laws
of the state in which the Substitute Property is located as shall be recommended
for similar transactions by the counsel admitted to practice in such state and
delivering the opinion as to the enforceability of such documents required
pursuant to clause (xviii) below. The Mortgage encumbering the Substitute
Property shall secure all amounts evidenced by the Note, provided that in the
event that the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located imposes
a mortgage recording, intangibles or similar tax and does not permit the
allocation of indebtedness for the purpose of determining the amount of such tax
payable, the principal amount secured by such Mortgage shall be equal to one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the fair market value of the Substitute
Property. The amount of the Loan allocated to the Substitute Property (such
amount being hereinafter referred to as the "SUBSTITUTE RELEASE AMOUNT") shall
equal the Release Amount of the related Substituted Property.

redated commitment to issue such title insurance policy) insuring the Lien of
the Mortgage encumbering the Substitute Property, issued by the title company
that issued the title insurance policies insuring the Lien of the existing
Mortgages and dated as of the date of the substitution, with reinsurance and
direct access agreements that replace such agreements issued in connection with
the title insurance policy insuring the Lien of the Mortgage encumbering the
Substituted Property. The title insurance policy issued with respect to the
Substitute Property shall (1) provide coverage in the amount of the Substitute
Release Amount if the "tie-in" or similar endorsement described above is

Amount, (2) insure Lender that the relevant Mortgage creates a valid first lien
on the Substitute Property encumbered thereby, free and clear of all exceptions
from coverage other than Permitted Encumbrances and standard exceptions and
exclusions from coverage (as modified by the terms of any endorsements), (3)

of such endorsements and title insurance policies have been paid.

         (m) Lender shall have received a current survey for each Substitute
Property, certified to the title company and Lender and their successors and

the survey of the Substituted Property prepared by a professional land surveyor
licensed in the state in which the Substitute Property is located and acceptable
to the Rating Agencies in accordance with the 1992 Minimum Standard Detail
Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys. Such survey shall reflect the
same legal description contained in the title insurance policy relating to such
Substitute Property and shall include, among other things, a metes and bounds
description of the real property comprising part of such Substitute Property
(unless such real property has been satisfactorily designated by lot number on a
recorded plat). The surveyor's seal shall be affixed to each survey and each
survey shall certify that the surveyed property is not located in a
"one-hundred-year flood hazard area."

         (n) Lender shall have received valid certificates of insurance
indicating that the requirements for the policies of insurance required for an
Individual Property hereunder have been satisfied with respect to the Substitute
Property and evidence of the payment of all premiums payable for the existing

jurisdiction; (B) an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Rating Agencies if the
Loan is part of a Securitization, or the Lender if the Loan is not part of a

executed and delivered by Borrower and that the execution and delivery of such
Loan Documents and the performance by Borrower of its obligations thereunder
will not cause a breach of, or a default under, any agreement, document or
instrument to which Borrower is a party or to which it or its properties are
bound; (C) an opinion of counsel acceptable to, the Rating Agencies if the Loan
is part of a Securitization, or the Lender if the Loan is not part of a
Securitization, stating that subjecting the Substitute Property to the Lien of

Documents does not and will not affect or impair the ability of Lender to
enforce its remedies under all of the Loan Documents or to realize the benefits
of the cross-collateralization provided for thereunder; (D) an update of the
Insolvency Opinion indicating that the substitution does not affect the opinions
set forth therein; (E) an opinion of counsel acceptable to, the Rating Agencies

Section 1001 of the Code or otherwise cause a tax to be imposed on a "prohibited
transaction" by any REMIC Trust.

trust, loan agreement, partnership agreement, management agreement or other
agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by which any of

instrument or subject to any restriction which might materially and adversely
affect Borrower or any Individual Property, or Borrower's business, properties
or assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise. Borrower is not in
default in any material respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of
any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which Borrower or any of the Properties
is bound. Borrower has no material financial obligation under any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to
which Borrower is a party or by which Borrower or the Properties are otherwise
bound, other than (a) obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the
operation of the Properties as permitted pursuant to clause (xx) of the
definition of "Special Purpose Entity" set forth in Section 1.1 hereof and (b)
obligations under the Loan Documents.

         4.1.6 TITLE. Borrower has good, marketable and insurable fee simple
title to the real property comprising part of each Individual Property and good
title to the balance of such Individual Property, free and clear of all Liens
whatsoever except the Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted
pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. The
Permitted Encumbrances in the aggregate do not materially and adversely affect
the value, operation or use of the applicable Individual Property (as currently
used) or Borrower's ability to repay the Loan. Each Mortgage, when properly
recorded in the appropriate

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code financing statements required
to be filed in connection therewith, will create (a) a valid, perfected first
priority lien on the applicable Individual Property, subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances and the Liens created by the Loan Documents and (b) perfected
security interests in and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all
personalty (including the Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in
each case subject only to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances, such other
Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens created by
the Loan Documents. There are no claims for payment for work, labor or materials

executed the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and (b) received reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under such Loan Documents.
Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower's assets exceeds
and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower's total
liabilities, including, without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed
and contingent liabilities. The fair saleable value of Borrower's assets is and
will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's
probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities
on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not
and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed
to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe that it will,
incur debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other
commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they mature
(taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower
and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower). No
petition in bankruptcy has been filed against Borrower or any constituent Person
in the last seven (7) years, and neither Borrower nor any constituent Person in
the last seven (7) years has ever made an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or taken advantage of any insolvency act for the benefit of debtors.
Neither Borrower nor any of its constituent Persons are contemplating either the
filing of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency
laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower's assets or
property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing
of any such petition against it or such constituent Persons.

         4.1.8 FULL AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE. No statement of fact made by
Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make statements contained herein or therein not misleading. There
is no material fact presently known to Borrower which has not been disclosed to
Lender which adversely affects, nor as far as Borrower can foresee, might
adversely affect, any Individual Property or the business, operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower.

         4.1.9 NO PLAN ASSETS. Borrower is not an "employee benefit plan," as

liability and such other insurance, as is more fully provided in this Agreement.
Borrower shall operate any Individual Property that is the subject of the O&M
Agreement in accordance with the terms and provisions thereof in all material
respects. After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own expense,
may contest by appropriate legal proceeding promptly initiated and conducted in

any alleged violation of any Legal Requirement, provided that (i) no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured; (ii) Borrower is permitted to
do so under the provisions of any mortgage or deed of trust superior in lien to
the applicable Mortgage; (iii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of any instrument to which Borrower
is subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding
shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable statutes, laws and
ordinances; (iv) no Individual Property nor any part thereof or interest therein
will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost; (v)
Borrower shall promptly upon final determination thereof comply with any such
Legal Requirement determined to be valid or applicable or cure any violation of

contested Legal Requirement against Borrower or any Individual Property; and
(vii) Borrower shall furnish such security as may be required in the proceeding,
or as may be requested by Lender, to insure compliance with such Legal
Requirement, together with all interest and penalties payable in connection
therewith. Lender may apply any such security, as necessary to cause compliance

Lender, the validity, applicability or violation of such Legal Requirement is
finally established or any Individual Property (or any part thereof or interest
therein) shall be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or
lost.

furnish to Lender receipts for the payment of the Taxes and the Other Charges
prior to the date the same shall become delinquent (provided, however, Borrower
is not required to furnish such receipts for payment of Taxes in the event that

shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and discharged any Lien or
charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge against the
Properties, and shall promptly pay for all utility services provided to the
Properties. After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own expense,

proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable statutes, laws
and ordinances; (iv) no Individual Property nor any part thereof or interest

Person maintaining such books, records and accounts and to make such copies or
extracts thereof as Lender shall desire. After the occurrence of an Event of

such year, each such percentage to be expressed on both a per year and
cumulative basis, and (vi) a schedule audited by such independent certified
public accountant reconciling Net Operating Income to Net Cash Flow (the "NET
CASH FLOW SCHEDULE"), which shall itemize all adjustments made to Net Operating
Income to arrive at Net Cash Flow deemed material by such independent certified
public accountant. Together with Borrower's annual financial statements,
Borrower shall furnish to Lender an Officer's Certificate certifying as of the
date thereof whether there exists an event or circumstance which constitutes a
Default or Event of Default under the Loan Documents executed and delivered by,
or applicable to, Borrower, and if such Default or Event of Default exists, the

well as each Individual Property (subject to normal year-end adjustments) as
applicable: (i) a occupancy report for the subject month accompanied by an
Officer's Certificate with respect thereto; (ii) monthly and year-to-date

calculation reflecting the annual Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the
immediately preceding twelve (12) month period as of the last day of such month
accompanied by an Officers' Certificate with respect thereto; and (iv) a Net
Cash Flow Schedule. In addition, such Officer's Certificate shall also state the
representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in Section 4.1.30 are true
and correct as of the date of such certificate and that there are no trade
payables outstanding for more than sixty (60) days.

         (d) For the partial year period commencing on the date hereof, and for
each Fiscal Year thereafter, Borrower shall submit to Lender an Annual Budget
not later than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of such period or
Fiscal Year in form reasonably satisfactory to Lender. The Annual Budget shall
be subject to Lender's written approval (each such Annual Budget, an "APPROVED

shall be adjusted to reflect actual increases in Taxes, Insurance Premiums and
Other Charges.

         (e) In the event that, Borrower must incur an extraordinary operating
expense or capital expense not set forth in the Approved Annual Budget (each an
"EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE"), then Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender a
reasonably detailed explanation of such proposed Extraordinary Expense for
Lender's approval.

         (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.1.11, for so long as the WESCO Lease is in effect and no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall be required to deliver or cause to be

obligations shall be deemed compliance with the delivery requirements for
financial documentation in accordance with this Section 5.1.11:

         5.1.20 LEASING MATTERS. Any Leases with respect to an Individual
Property written after the date hereof, shall be approved by Lender, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided,
however that Lender shall be permitted to withhold its consent in its sole
discretion with respect to a Lease (other than the current WESCO Lease) of all
or substantially all of any Individual Property. Upon request, Borrower shall
furnish Lender with executed copies of all Leases. All proposed Leases shall be

or assignment of the WESCO Lease described in clauses (A) through (C)
hereinafter collectively referred to as a "PERMITTED LEASE TRANSACTION").

         5.1.21 ALTERATIONS. Borrower shall obtain Lender's prior written
consent to any alterations to any Improvements costing, in any one instance, in
excess of $100,000.00 (other than any alteration pertaining to the replacement
of the roof of a building situated on an Individual Property, for which no
consent shall be required) or would otherwise have a material adverse effect on
the applicable Individual Property, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed except with respect to alterations that may have a material
adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition, the value of the applicable
Individual Property or the Net Operating Income. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender's consent shall not be required in connection with any alterations that
will not have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition, the
value of the applicable Individual Property or the Net Operating Income,
provided that such alterations are made in connection with (a) tenant
improvement work performed pursuant to the terms of any Lease executed on or
before the date hereof, (b) tenant improvement work performed pursuant to the
terms and provisions of a Lease and not adversely affecting any structural
component of any Improvements, any utility or HVAC system contained in any
Improvements or the exterior of any building constituting a part of any
Improvements, or (c) alterations performed in connection with the Restoration of
an Individual Property after the occurrence of a Casualty or Condemnation in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. If the total unpaid
amounts due and payable with respect to alterations to the Improvements at any
Individual Property (other than such amounts to be paid or reimbursed by tenants
under the Leases) shall at any time exceed Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($200,000.00) (the "THRESHOLD AMOUNT"), Borrower shall promptly deliver
to Lender as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional security
for Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the following: (A)
cash, (B) U.S. Obligations, (C) other securities having a rating acceptable to
Lender and that the applicable Rating Agencies have confirmed in writing will
not, in and of itself, result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
initial, or, if higher, then current ratings assigned to any Securities or any
class thereof in

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

connection with any Securitization or (D) a completion and performance bond or
an irrevocable letter of credit (payable on sight draft only) issued by a
financial institution having a rating by S&P of not less than "A-1+" if the term
of such bond or letter of credit is no longer than three (3) months or, if such
term is in excess of three (3) months, issued by a financial institution having
a rating that is acceptable to Lender and that the applicable Rating Agencies
have confirmed in writing will not, in and of itself, result in a downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then current ratings
assigned to any Securities or class thereof in connection with any
Securitization. Such security shall be in an amount equal to the excess of the
total unpaid amounts with respect to alterations to the Improvements on the
applicable Individual Property (other than such amounts to be paid or reimbursed
by tenants under the Leases) over the Threshold Amount and Lender may apply such
security from time to time at the option of Lender to pay for such alterations.

         5.1.22 OPERATION OF PROPERTY. (a) Borrower shall cause the Properties
to be operated, in all material respects, in accordance with any Management
Agreement (or Replacement Management Agreement) as applicable. In the event that
a Management Agreement expires or is terminated (without limiting any obligation
of Borrower to obtain Lender's consent to any termination or modification of the
Management Agreement in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement), Borrower shall promptly enter into a Replacement Management
Agreement with Manager or another Qualified Manager, as applicable.

           (b) Borrower shall: (i) promptly perform and/or observe, in all
   material respects, all of the covenants and agreements required to be
   performed and observed by it under the Management Agreement and do all things
   necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights thereunder;
   (ii) promptly notify Lender of any material default under any Management
   Agreement of which it is aware; (iii) promptly deliver to Lender a copy of
   each financial statement, business plan, capital expenditures plan, notice,
   report and estimate received by it under any Management Agreement; and (iv)
   enforce the performance and observance of all of the covenants and agreements
   required to be performed and/or observed by Manager under any Management
   Agreement, in a commercially reasonable manner.

         5.1.23 SUPPLEMENTAL MORTGAGE AFFIDAVITS. As of the date hereof,
Borrower represents that it has paid all state, county and municipal recording
and all other taxes imposed upon the execution and recordation of the Mortgages.
If at any time Lender determines, based on applicable law, that Lender is not
being afforded the maximum amount of security available from any one or more of
the Properties which was contemplated by the parties hereto as of the Closing
Date, as a direct or indirect result of applicable taxes not having been paid
with respect to any Individual Property, Borrower agrees that Borrower will
execute, acknowledge and deliver to Lender, immediately upon Lender's request,
supplemental affidavits increasing the amount of the Debt attributable to any

business other than the ownership and operation of the Properties, or make any
material change in the scope or nature of its business objectives, purposes or

initiate the joint assessment of any Individual Property with (a) any other real
property constituting a tax lot separate from such Individual Property, or (b)

Borrower shall not change its' name, identity (including its trade name or
names), place of organization or formation (as set forth in Section 4.1.36
hereof) or Borrower's corporate, partnership or other structure without
notifying Lender of such change in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to
the effective date of such change and, in the case of a change in Borrower's
structure, without first obtaining the prior written consent of Lender. Upon
Lender's request, Borrower shall execute and deliver additional financing
statements, security agreements and other instruments which may be necessary to
effectively evidence or perfect Lender's security interest in the Property as a
result of such change of principal place of business or place of organization.

         5.2.9 ERISA. (a) Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which

the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA; (B) Borrower is not subject to any state
statute regulating investment of, or fiduciary

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

obligations with respect to governmental plans and (C) one or more of the
following circumstances is true:

                  (i)    Equity interests in Borrower are publicly offered
         securities, within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101(b)(2);

                  (ii)   Less than twenty-five percent (25%) of each outstanding
         class of equity interests in Borrower is held by "benefit plan
         investors" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101(f)(2); or

                  (iii)  Borrower qualifies as an "operating company" or a "real
         estate operating company" within the meaning of 29
         C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101(c) or (e).

         5.2.10 TRANSFERS. (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has examined
and relied on the experience of Borrower and its general partners, members,
principals and (if Borrower is a trust) beneficial owners in owning and
operating properties such as the Properties in agreeing to make the Loan, and
will continue to rely on Borrower's ownership of the Properties as a means of
maintaining the value of the Properties as security for repayment of the Debt
and the performance of the Other Obligations. Borrower acknowledges that Lender
has a valid interest in maintaining the value of the Properties so as to ensure
that, should Borrower default in the repayment of the Debt or the performance of
the Other Obligations, Lender can recover the Debt by a sale of the Properties.

           (b) Without the prior written consent of Lender, and except to the
   extent otherwise set forth in this Section 5.2.10, Borrower shall not, and
   shall not permit any Restricted Party do any of the following (collectively,
   a "TRANSFER"): (i) sell, convey, mortgage, grant, bargain, encumber, pledge,
   assign, grant options with respect to, or otherwise transfer or dispose of
   (directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or
   otherwise, and whether or not for consideration or of record) the Properties
   or any part thereof or any legal or beneficial interest therein or (ii)
   permit a Sale or Pledge of an interest in any Restricted Party, other than
   (A) pursuant to the WESCO Lease or other Leases in accordance with the
   provisions of Section 5.1.20 and (B) Permitted Transfers.

           (c) A Transfer shall include, but not be limited to, (i) an
   installment sales agreement wherein Borrower agrees to sell the Properties or
   any part thereof for a price to be paid in installments; (ii) an agreement by
   Borrower leasing all or a substantial part of any Individual Property for
   other than actual occupancy by a space tenant thereunder or a sale,
   assignment or other transfer of, or the grant of a security interest in,
   Borrower's right, title and interest in and to any Leases or any Rents; (iii)
   if a Restricted Party is a corporation, any merger, consolidation or Sale or
   Pledge of such corporation's stock or the creation or issuance of new stock;
   (iv) if a Restricted Party is a limited or general partnership or joint
   venture, any merger or consolidation or the change, removal, resignation or
   addition of a general partner or the Sale or Pledge of the partnership
   interest of any general partner or any profits or proceeds relating to such
   partnership interest, or the Sale or Pledge of limited partnership interests
   or any profits or proceeds relating to such limited partnership interest or

or Pledge of the membership interest of a managing member (or if no managing
member, any member) or any profits or proceeds relating to such membership
interest, or the Sale or Pledge of non-managing membership interests or the
creation or issuance of new non-managing membership interests; (vi) if a
Restricted Party is a trust or nominee trust, any merger, consolidation or the
Sale or Pledge of the legal or beneficial interest in a Restricted Party or the
creation or issuance of new legal or beneficial interests; or (vii) the removal
or the resignation of any Manager (including, without limitation, an Affiliated
Manager) other than in accordance with Section 5.1.22 hereof.

           (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.2.10(d), the
following transfers shall not be deemed to be a Transfer: (i) the Sale or
Pledge, in one or a series of transactions, of not more than forty-nine percent
(49%) of the stock in a Restricted Party; provided, however, no such Transfers
shall result in the change of voting control in the Restricted Party, and as a
condition to each such Transfer, Lender shall receive not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice of such proposed Transfer, (ii) the Sale or Pledge, in
one or a series of transactions, of not more than forty-nine percent (49%) of
the limited partnership interests or non-managing membership interests (as the
case may be) in a Restricted Party; provided, however, as a condition to each
such Transfer, Lender shall receive not less than thirty (30) days prior written
notice of such proposed Transfer, (iii) the sale, transfer or issuance of stock
in WESCO International, Inc. provided such stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange or such other nationally recognized stock exchange, (iv) the Sale or
Pledge, in one or a series of transactions, of WESCO Distribution, Inc. or WESCO
International, Inc. to a Qualified Transferee, provided that (A) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (B) Lender shall receive not
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such proposed transfer. The
following additional conditions must be satisfied in connection with any Sale or
Pledge described in clause (iv) above (I) such sale or transfer is permitted
pursuant to the terms of the respective organizational documents of the entity
in which such interests are held, or if not so permitted, the requisite
percentage of interest holders set forth in such organizational documents
consent to such sale or transfer; (II) Lender has received payment of a transfer
fee equal to one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
at the time of such transfer and (III) Borrower shall pay all other expenses of
Lender incurred in connection with such transfer. Lenders agrees to make good
faith attempts to promptly respond to such request for a Transfer, but Lender's
failure to respond shall under no circumstances be deemed in any way an approval
of such request or a waiver of any other rights it may have under the Loan
Documents.

           (e) Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment
of its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in order to declare
the Debt immediately due and payable upon Borrower's Transfer without Lender's
consent. This provision shall apply to every Transfer regardless of whether
voluntary or not, or whether or not Lender has consented to any previous
Transfer.

         Individual Property shall at any time constitute legal non-conforming
         structures or uses, coverage for loss due to operation of law in an
         amount equal to the full Replacement Cost, coverage for demolition
         costs and coverage for increased costs of construction. In addition,
         Borrower shall obtain: (x) if any portion of the Improvements is
         currently or at any time in the future located in a federally

         the Note or (2) the maximum amount of such insurance available under
         the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection
         Act of 1973 or the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each

         incurred during a period of Restoration) for a period of at least
         twelve (12) months after the date of the Casualty; and (D) containing
         an extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides that after
         the physical loss to the Improvements and Personal Property has been
         repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until such
         income either returns to the same level it was at prior to the loss, or
         the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date that the applicable
         Individual Property is repaired or replaced and operations are resumed,
         whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding that the policy may expire
         prior to the end of such period. The amount of such business income
         insurance shall be determined prior to the date hereof and at least
         once each year thereafter based on Borrower's reasonable estimate of
         the gross revenues from each Individual Property for the succeeding
         twelve (12) month period. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
         2.5.5 hereof, all proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this
         subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to

<PAGE>

         the obligations secured by the Loan Documents from time to time due
         and payable hereunder and under the Note; provided, however, that
         nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of its
         obligations to pay the obligations secured by the Loan Documents on
         the respective dates of payment provided for in the Note and the
         other Loan Documents except to the extent such amounts are actually

          the so-called "occurrence" form with a combined limit of not less than
          Two Million and 00/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00)  in the aggregate and
          One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence; (B) to
          continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until required to be

<PAGE>

                  (viii) umbrella and excess liability insurance in an amount
         not less than Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) per

         including, but not limited to, supplemental coverage for employer

         shall apply in excess of the automobile liability coverage in clause
         (vi) above;

                  (ix)   the commercial property and business income insurance

         consistent with those required under Section 6.1(a)(i) and (ii) above
         at all times during the term of the Loan so long as (A) Lender
         determines that either (I) prudent owners of real estate comparable to
         the Properties are maintaining same or (II) prudent institutional
         lenders (including, without limitation, investment banks) to such
         owners are requiring that such owners maintain such insurance; or (B)
         if such insurance is obtainable from any insurer or the United States
         of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and is required by
         any prospective investor in connection with a Securitization pursuant
         to Section 9.1 hereof or the lack of such insurance in and of itself
         will result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the then
         current ratings assigned, or to be assigned, or prevent ratings from
         being assigned, to the Securities or any class thereof in any
         applicable Securitization; provided, however, that with respect to the
         Individual Property located in Warrendale, Butler County, Pennsylvania,
         the amount of insurance shall not be less than the Full Replacement
         Cost for such Individual Property; and

                  (x)    upon sixty (60) days written notice, such other
          reasonable insurance, including, but not limited to, sinkhole or land
          subsidence insurance, and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from
          time to time may reasonably request against such other insurable
          hazards which at the time are commonly insured against for property
          similar to the Individual Property located in or around the region in
          which the Individual Property is located.

            (b) All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof (i) shall be
obtained under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or
in the singular, the "POLICY") and (ii) shall be subject to the approval of
Lender as to insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and
insureds, provided, however that the amount of said deductibles may be subject
to adjustment based on fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index or similar
standard. The Policies shall be issued by financially sound and responsible
insurance companies authorized to do business in the State and having a claims
paying ability rating of "A" or better by S&P or a financial class of VII or
better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The Policies described in Section 6.1 hereof
(other than those strictly limited to liability protection) shall designate
Lender as loss payee. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration dates
of the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender, certificates of insurance

                                      -67-

<PAGE>

evidencing the Policies accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS"), shall be
delivered by Borrower to Lender.

         (c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the
Individual Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder
and shall otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy
insuring only the Properties in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(a)
hereof.

         (d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 6.1(a) hereof,
except for the Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(vii) of this Agreement, shall
name Borrower as the insured and Lender as the additional insured, as its
interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler and machinery,
flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called New York standard
non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss
thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

         (e) All Policies shall contain clauses or endorsements to the effect
that:

             (i)    no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for
         Borrower, or of any tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with
         the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a
         forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way
         affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as
         Lender is concerned;

             (ii)    the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to
          increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least
          thirty (30) days written notice to Lender and any other party named
          therein as an additional insured;

             (iii)  the issuers thereof shall give written notice to Lender if
         the Policy has not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to its
         expiration; and

             (iv)   Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
         thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

         (f)      If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence
that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall
have the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Properties, including, without
limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole
discretion deems appropriate after three (3) Business Days notice to Borrower if
prior to the date upon which any such coverage will lapse or at any time Lender
deems necessary (regardless of prior notice to Borrower) to avoid the lapse of
any such coverage. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the
Mortgages and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

         SECTION 6.2 CASUALTY.

         If any Individual Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or
in part, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall give prompt
notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently
prosecute the completion of the Restoration of the Individual Property pursuant
to Section 6.4 hereof as nearly as possible to the condition the Property was in
immediately prior to such Casualty, with such alterations as may be reasonably
approved by Lender and otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4 hereof. Borrower
shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by
insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not
made promptly by Borrower. In addition, Lender may participate in any settlement
discussions with any insurance companies with respect to any Casualty in which
the Net Proceeds or the costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or
greater than Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($200,000.00) and Borrower
shall deliver to Lender all instruments required by Lender to permit such
participation.

         SECTION 6.3 CONDEMNATION.

         Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of any Individual Property
and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers served in connection
with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such proceedings, and
Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all instruments requested by
it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently
prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and
experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or defense of any such
proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or quasi-public authority
through Condemnation or otherwise (including, but not limited to, any transfer
made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower
shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the manner provided for its
payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt shall not be reduced
until any Award shall have been actually received and applied by Lender, after
the deduction of expenses of collection, to the reduction or discharge of the
Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest paid on the Award by the
condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive out of the Award interest
at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note. If any Individual Property
or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority, Borrower shall
promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the applicable
Individual Property or any portion thereof pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof and
otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6.4 hereof. If any Individual
Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by
Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency
judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the
Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

         SECTION 6.4 RESTORATION.

                  The following provisions shall apply in connection with the
Restoration of any Individual Property:

                                      -69-

<PAGE>

         (a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than Two Hundred Thousand and
00/100 Dollars ($200,000.00) and the costs of completing the Restoration shall
be less than Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($200,000.00), the Net
Proceeds will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i) hereof are met and Borrower
delivers (or causes the WESCO Tenant to deliver) to Lender a written undertaking
to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due diligence the
Restoration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than Two Hundred
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($200,000.00) or the costs of completing the
Restoration is equal to or greater than Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($200,000.00), Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS"
for purposes of this Section 6.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance
proceeds received by Lender pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i), (iv), (ix) and (x) as
a result of such damage or destruction, after deduction of its reasonable costs
and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any,
in collecting same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award,
after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited
to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting same ("CONDEMNATION
PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

                  (i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
         Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                      (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                  continuing;

                      (B) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance
                  Proceeds, less than the Restoration Threshold Floor Area has
                  been damaged, destroyed or rendered unusable as a result of
                  such Casualty or (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                  Condemnation Proceeds, less than twenty percent (20%) of the
                  land constituting the Individual Property is taken, and such
                  land is located along the perimeter or periphery of the
                  Individual Property, and no portion of the Improvements is
                  located on such land;

                      (C) the WESCO Lease shall remain in full force and effect
                  during and after the completion of the Restoration (or, if the
                  WESCO Lease is not longer in effect, then at least ninety
                  percent (90%) of the Leases that were in effect at the time of
                  such Casualty or Condemnation), notwithstanding the occurrence
                  of any such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may
                  be, and will make all necessary repairs and restorations
                  thereto at their sole cost and expense.

                      (D) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
                  reasonably practicable (but in no event later than the
                  earlier of (i) than sixty (60) days after the adjustment of
                  any insurance claim or (ii) one hundred twenty (120) days
                  after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may
                  be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to
                  satisfactory completion;

                                      -70-

<PAGE>

                        (E) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will
                  be completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) six (6)
                  months prior to the Maturity Date or (2) such time as may be
                  required under all applicable Legal Requirements in order to
                  repair and restore the applicable Individual Property to the
                  condition it was in immediately prior to such Casualty or to
                  as nearly as possible the condition it was in immediately
                  prior to such Condemnation, as applicable, or (4) the
                  expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
                  6.1(a)(ii) hereof;

                        (F) the Individual Property and the use thereof after
                  the Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under
                  all applicable Legal Requirements;

                        (G) the Restoration shall be done and completed by
                  Borrower in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                  compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements;

                        (H) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does
                  not result in the loss of access to the Individual Property
                  or the related Improvements;

                        (I) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all of the
                  Individual Properties on an aggregate basis, after giving
                  effect to the Restoration, shall be equal to or greater than
                  1.40 to 1.0;

                        (J) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
                  Lender a signed detailed budget approved in writing by
                  Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire cost of
                  completing the Restoration, which budget shall be acceptable
                  to Lender; and

                        (K) if the WESCO Lease is no longer in effect, the
                  Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash equivalent
                  deposited by Borrower with Lender are sufficient in Lender's
                  discretion to cover the cost of the Restoration.

                  (ii)  The Net Proceeds in excess of $200,000 shall be held by
         Lender in an interest-bearing account and, until disbursed in
         accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), shall constitute
         additional security for the Debt and Other Obligations under the Loan
         Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as
         directed by, Borrower from time to time during the course of the
         Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A)
         all materials installed and work and labor performed (except to the
         extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested disbursement)
         in connection with the Restoration have been paid for in full, and (B)
         there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or
         materialman's liens or notices of intention to file same, or any other
         liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever on the Individual
         Property which have not either been fully bonded to the satisfaction of
         Lender and

                                      -71-

<PAGE>

         discharged of record or in the alternative fully insured to the
         satisfaction of Lender by the title company issuing the Title
         Insurance Policy.

                  (iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with
         any Restoration costing in excess of Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100
         Dollars ($200,000.00) in the aggregate shall be subject to prior review
         and acceptance in all respects by Lender and by an independent
         consulting engineer selected by Lender (the "CASUALTY CONSULTANT").
         Lender shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all
         permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with
         the Restoration. The identity of the contractors, subcontractors and
         materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as the contracts under
         which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review and
         acceptance by Lender and the Casualty Consultant. All costs and
         expenses incurred by Lender in connection with making the Net Proceeds
         available for the Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable
         counsel fees and disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees,
         shall be paid by Borrower.

                  (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
         disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the
         costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of
         the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the
         Casualty Retainage. The term "CASUALTY RETAINAGE" shall mean an amount
         equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for work in
         place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty
         Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The Casualty
         Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary set forth above in this Section 6.4(b), be less than the
         amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors, subcontractors
         and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The Casualty Retainage
         shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender
         that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for
         the re-occupancy and use of the Individual Property have been obtained
         from all appropriate governmental and quasi-governmental authorities,
         and Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of
         the Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of
         the Casualty Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the
         portion of the Casualty Retainage being held with respect to any
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as
         of the date upon which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that
         the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily
         completed all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with
         the provisions of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's
         contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the
         lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested
         by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy,
         and Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy
         insuring the continued priority of the lien of the related Mortgage and
         evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If
         required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Casualty
         Retainage shall be approved by the surety

                                      -72-

<PAGE>

         company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with
         respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

                  (v)    Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
          of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (vi)   If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed
         balance thereof shall not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation
         with the Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance
         of the costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be
         incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower
         shall deposit the deficiency (the "NET PROCEEDS DEFICIENCY") with
         Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be
         made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held
         by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in
         connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to
         the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant
         to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the
         Debt and Other Obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (vii)  The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds (and the
         remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency) deposited
         with Lender after the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the
         Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of
         this Section 6.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory
         to Lender that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration
         have been paid in full, shall be deposited in the Cash Management
         Account to be disbursed in accordance with the Cash Management
         Agreement, provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall
         be continuing under the Note, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
         Documents.

         (c) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 6.4(b)(vii) hereof may be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt in accordance with Section 2.4.1 hereof, whether or not then
due and payable in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole
discretion shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Lender, the same may be
paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall
approve, in its discretion.

         (d) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage with respect to an
Individual Property, or other transfer of title of an Individual Property in
extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all right, title and interest of
Borrower in and to the Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force
concerning such Individual Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall
thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other
transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.

         VII. RESERVE FUNDS

         SECTION 7.1 REQUIRED REPAIRS.

                                      -73-

<PAGE>

         7.1.1 DEPOSITS. Borrower shall perform the repairs at the Properties,
as more particularly set forth on Schedule III hereto (such repairs hereinafter
referred to as "REQUIRED REPAIRS"). Borrower shall complete the Required Repairs
on or before the required deadline for each repair as set forth on Schedule III.
It shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement if (a) Borrower does not
complete the Required Repairs at each Individual Property by the required
deadline for each repair as set forth on Schedule III, or (b) Borrower does not
satisfy each condition contained in Section 7.1.2 hereof. Upon the occurrence of
such an Event of Default, Lender, at its option, may withdraw all Required
Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account and Lender may apply such funds
either to completion of the Required Repairs at one or more of the Properties or
toward payment of the Debt in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may
determine in its sole discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply Required
Repair Funds shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies provided to
Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. On the Closing Date,
Borrower shall deposit with Lender the amount for each Individual Property set
forth on such Schedule III hereto to perform the Required Repairs for such
Individual Property. Amounts so deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender in
accordance with Section 7.5 hereof. Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be
referred to as Borrower's "REQUIRED REPAIR FUND" and the account in which such
amounts are held shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "REQUIRED REPAIR
ACCOUNT".

         7.1.2 RELEASE OF REQUIRED REPAIR FUNDS. Lender shall disburse to
Borrower the Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account from time to
time upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following conditions: (a)
Borrower shall submit a written request for payment to Lender at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date on which Borrower requests such payment be made and
specifies the Required Repairs to be paid, (b) on the date such request is
received by Lender and on the date such payment is to be made, no Default or
Event of Default shall exist and remain uncured, (c) Lender shall have received
an Officers' Certificate (i) stating that all Required Repairs at the applicable
Individual Property to be funded by the requested disbursement have been
completed in good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, such certificate to be
accompanied by a copy of any license, permit or other approval by any
Governmental Authority required to commence and/or complete the Required
Repairs, (ii) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in
connection with the Required Repairs performed at such Individual Property to be
funded by the requested disbursement, and (iii) stating that each such Person
has been paid in full or will be paid in full upon such disbursement, such
Officers' Certificate to be accompanied by lien waivers or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to Lender, (d) at Lender's option, a title search for such
Individual Property indicating that such Individual Property is free from all
liens, claims and other encumbrances not previously approved by Lender, and (e)
Lender shall have received such other evidence as Lender shall reasonably
request that the Required Repairs at such Individual Property to be funded by
the requested disbursement have been completed and are paid for or will be paid
upon such disbursement to Borrower. Lender shall not be required to make
disbursements from the Required Repair Account with respect to any Individual
Property unless such requested disbursement is in an amount greater than
Twenty-five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) (or a lesser amount if the
total amount in the Required Repair Account is less than Twenty-five Thousand
and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000.00), in which case only one disbursement of the
amount remaining in the account shall be made) and such disbursement shall be
made only upon satisfaction of each condition contained in this Section 7.1.2.

                                      -74-

SECTION 7.2 TAX AND INSURANCE ESCROW FUND.

         Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth
(1/12)of the Taxes and Other Charges that Lender estimates will be payable
during the next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with Lender
sufficient funds to pay all such Taxes and Other Charges at least thirty (30)
days prior to their respective due dates, and (b) one-twelfth (1/12) of the
Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable for the renewal of the
coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in order to
accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at
least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in
(a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "TAX AND INSURANCE ESCROW FUND"). The
Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and the Monthly Debt Service Payment Amount, shall
be added together and shall be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender.
Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and
Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.1.2
hereof and under the Mortgages. In making any payment relating to the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or
estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or
insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the
accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax,
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount
of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes,
Other Charges and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof, Lender
shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such
excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund.
Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund after the Debt has
been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. In allocating such excess,
Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender to be the Owner
of the Properties. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes, Other
Charges and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and (b) above,
Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase
its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender estimates is sufficient
to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of the
Taxes and Other Charges and/or thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the
Policies, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for so long as
Borrower maintains the blanket Policy of insurance in effect as of the date
hereof and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower
shall not be obligated to deposit the cost of Insurance Premiums in the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund.

         SECTION 7.3 REPLACEMENTS AND REPLACEMENT RESERVE.

         7.3.1 REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUND. Borrower shall pay to Lender on each
Payment Date $7002.78 (the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT") reasonably
estimated by Lender in its sole discretion to be due for replacements and
repairs required to be made to the Properties during the calendar year
(collectively, the "REPLACEMENTS"). Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be
referred to as Borrower's "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUND" and the account in which
such amounts are held shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's
"REPLACEMENT RESERVE ACCOUNT". Lender may reassess its estimate of the amount
necessary for the Replacement Reserve Fund from time to time, and may increase
the monthly amounts required to be deposited into the Replacement Reserve Fund
upon thirty (30) days notice to Borrower if Lender determines in its reasonable
discretion that an increase is necessary to maintain the

                                      -75-

<PAGE>

proper maintenance and operation of the Properties. Any amount held in the
Replacement Reserve Account and allocated for an Individual Property shall be
retained by Lender and credited toward the future Replacement Reserves Monthly
Deposits required by Lender hereunder in the event such Individual Property is
released from the Lien of its related Mortgage in accordance with Section 2.5
hereof.

         7.3.2 DISBURSEMENTS FROM REPLACEMENT RESERVE ACCOUNT. (a) Lender shall
make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to pay Borrower only for
the costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not be obligated to make
disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account to reimburse Borrower for the
costs of routine maintenance to an Individual Property, replacements of
inventory or for costs which are to be reimbursed from the Required Repair Fund.

         (b) Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction
of the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2, disburse to Borrower
amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account necessary to pay for the actual
approved costs of Replacements or to reimburse Borrower therefor, upon
completion of such Replacements (or, upon partial completion in the case of
Replacements made pursuant to Section 7.3.2(e) hereof) as determined by Lender.
In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Replacement
Reserve Account if a Default or an Event of Default exists.

         (c) Each request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account
shall be in a form specified or approved by Lender and shall specify (i) the
specific Replacements for which the disbursement is requested, (ii) the quantity
and price of each item purchased, if the Replacement includes the purchase or
replacement of specific items, (iii) the price of all materials (grouped by type
or category) used in any Replacement other than the purchase or replacement of
specific items, and (iv) the cost of all contracted labor or other services
applicable to each Replacement for which such request for disbursement is made.
With each request Borrower shall certify that all Replacements have been made in
accordance with all applicable Legal Requirements of any Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the applicable Individual Property to which
Replacements are being provided. Each request for disbursement shall include
copies of invoices for all items or materials purchased and all contracted labor
or services provided and, unless Lender has agreed to issue joint checks as
described below in connection with a particular Replacement, each request shall
include evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment of all such amounts. Except
as provided in Section 7.3.2(e) hereof, each request for disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be made only after completion of the
Replacement for which disbursement is requested. Borrower shall provide Lender
evidence of completion of the subject Replacement satisfactory to Lender in its
reasonable judgment.

         (d) Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with the Replacements
with respect to which a disbursement is requested prior to submitting such
request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or, at the request
of Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks, payable to Borrower, the WESCO
Tenant and the contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic, subcontractor or
other party to whom payment is due in connection with a Replacement. In the case
of payments made by joint check, Lender may require a waiver of lien from each
Person receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement from the

                                      -76-

<PAGE>

Replacement Reserve Account. In addition, as a condition to any disbursement,
Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each contractor,
supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives payment in an
amount equal to or greater than Twenty-five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($25,000.00) for completion of its work or delivery of its materials. Any lien
waiver delivered hereunder shall conform to the requirements of applicable law
and shall cover all work performed and materials supplied (including equipment
and fixtures) for the applicable Individual Property by that contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the
current reimbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check,
the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

         (e) If (i) the cost of a Replacement exceeds Twenty-five Thousand and
00/100 Dollars ($25,000.00), (ii) the contractor performing such Replacement
requires periodic payments pursuant to terms of a written contract, and (iii)
Lender has approved in writing in advance such periodic payments, a request for
reimbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account may be made after completion
of a portion of the work under such contract, provided (A) such contract
requires payment upon completion of such portion of the work, (B) the materials
for which the request is made are on site at the applicable Individual Property
and are properly secured or have been installed in such Individual Property, (C)
all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been satisfied, (D)
funds remaining in the Replacement Reserve Account are, in Lender's judgment,
sufficient to complete such Replacement and other Replacements when required,
and (E) if required by Lender, each contractor or subcontractor receiving
payments under such contract shall provide a waiver of lien with respect to
amounts which have been paid to that contractor or subcontractor.

         (f) Borrower shall not make a request for disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account more frequently than once in any calendar month and
(except in connection with the final disbursement) the total cost of all
Replacements in any request shall not be less than Five Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($5,000.00).

         7.3.3 PERFORMANCE OF REPLACEMENTS. (a) Borrower shall make Replacements
when required in order to keep each Individual Property in condition and repair
consistent with other similar facilities in the same market segment in the
metropolitan area in which the respective Individual Property is located, and to
keep each Individual Property or any portion thereof from deteriorating.
Borrower shall complete all Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as
soon as practicable following the commencement of making each such Replacement.

         (b) Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all contracts
or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors,
contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
Replacements exceeds Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00), which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon Lender's request, Borrower
shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

         (c) In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that
any Replacement is not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that
any

                                      -77-

<PAGE>

Replacement has not been completed in a workmanlike or timely manner, Lender
shall have the option, following notice to Borrower, to withhold disbursement
for such unsatisfactory Replacement and to proceed under existing contracts or
to contract with third parties to complete such Replacement, to apply the
Replacement Reserve Fund toward the labor and materials necessary to complete
such Replacement, and to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender
upon an Event of Default hereunder.

         (d) Following notice to Borrower, in order to facilitate Lender's
completion or making of such Replacements pursuant to Section 7.3.3(c), Borrower
grants Lender the right to enter onto any Individual Property and perform any
and all work and labor necessary to complete or make such Replacements and/or
employ watchmen to protect such Individual Property from damage. All sums so
expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Replacement Reserve Fund, shall
be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and secured by the
Mortgages. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender its true
and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete or
undertake such Replacements in the name of Borrower. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any funds in the
Replacement Reserve Account for the purpose of making or completing such
Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes and corrections to such
Replacements as shall be necessary or desirable to complete such Replacements;
(iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and
inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or
compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may become Liens against
any Individual Property, or as may be necessary or desirable for the completion
of such Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v) to execute all applications
and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of the
contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in
connection with any Individual Property or the rehabilitation and repair of any
Individual Property; and (vii) to do any and every act which Borrower might do
in its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this Agreement.

         (e) Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing any Replacements; (ii) require Lender to expend funds
in addition to the Replacement Reserve Fund to make or complete any Replacement;
(iii) obligate Lender to proceed with any Replacements; or (iv) obligate Lender
to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement.

         (f) Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties making Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3
to enter onto each Individual Property during normal business hours (subject to
the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any
Replacements and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine
all plans and shop drawings relating to such Replacements which are or may be
kept at each Individual Property, and to complete any Replacements made pursuant
to this Section 7.3.3. Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors
to cooperate with Lender or Lender's representatives or such other persons
described above in connection with inspections described in this Section
7.3.3(f) or the completion of Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3.

                                      -78-

<PAGE>

         (g) Lender may require an inspection of the Individual Property at
Borrower's reasonable expense prior to making a monthly disbursement from the
Replacement Reserve Account in order to verify completion of the Replacements
for which reimbursement is sought. Lender may require that such inspection be
conducted by an appropriate independent qualified professional (selected by
Lender in all cases where the amount of the disbursement exceeds $100,000,
otherwise said inspection may be conducted by Borrower's in-house architect)
and/or may require a copy of a certificate of completion by such independent
qualified professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of any
amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower shall pay the reasonable
expense of the inspection as required hereunder, whether such inspection is
conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified professional.

         (h) The Replacements and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or any
other item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be constructed, installed
or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialmen's or
other liens (except for those Liens existing on the date of this Agreement which
have been approved in writing by Lender).

         (i) Before each disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account,
Lender may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to the
applicable Individual Property effective to the date of the disbursement, which
search shows that no mechanic's or materialmen's liens or other liens of any
nature have been placed against the applicable Individual Property since the
date of recordation of the related Mortgage and that title to such Individual
Property is free and clear of all Liens (other than the lien of the related
Mortgage and any other Liens previously approved in writing by Lender, if any).

         (j) All Replacements shall comply with all applicable Legal
Requirements of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the
applicable Individual Property and applicable insurance requirements including,
without limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits,
environmental regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

         (k) In addition to any insurance required under the Loan Documents,
Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided workmen's compensation insurance,
builder's risk, and public liability insurance and other insurance to the extent
required under applicable law in connection with a particular Replacement. All
such policies shall be in form and amount reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All
such policies which can be endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss
payable to Lender or its assigns shall be so endorsed. Certificates of insurance
for such policies shall be delivered to Lender.

         7.3.4 FAILURE TO MAKE REPLACEMENTS. (a) It shall be an Event of Default
under this Agreement if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this
Section 7.3 and such failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice
from Lender. Upon the occurrence of such an Event of Default, Lender may use the
Replacement Reserve Fund (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including but
not limited to completion of the Replacements as provided in Section 7.3.3, or
for any other repair or replacement to any Individual Property or toward payment
of the Debt in such order, proportion and priority as Lender may determine in
its sole discretion. Lender's right to withdraw and apply the Replacement
Reserve Funds shall be in

                                      -79-

<PAGE>

addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any
portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on account of an Event of Default to
payment of the Debt or in any specific order or priority.

         7.3.5 BALANCE IN THE REPLACEMENT RESERVE ACCOUNT. The insufficiency of
any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account shall not relieve Borrower from
its obligation to fulfill all preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan
Documents.

         SECTION 7.4 LIQUIDITY RESERVE.

         7.4.1 DEPOSITS TO LIQUIDITY RESERVE FUND. Borrower will be required to
deposit an amount equal to six (6) months of Monthly Debt Service with Lender or
its designee on the Closing Date, which amounts shall be deposited with and held
by Lender for tenant improvement and leasing commission obligations incurred
following the date hereof. Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to
as the "LIQUIDITY RESERVE FUND" and the account to which such amounts are held
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "LIQUIDITY RESERVE ACCOUNT". Lender
shall hold all funds in the Liquidity Reserve Account as additional security for
the Loan.

         7.4.2 ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS TO THE LIQUIDITY RESERVE FUND. (a) If at any
time during the term of the Loan either (i) the credit rating of Guarantor is
downgraded to "B" or withdrawn by S&P or (ii) there is a financial restatement
of financial operating results provided to the Securities and Exchange
Commission by Guarantor and its subsidiaries, Borrower shall cause WESCO Tenant
or Guarantor to deposit an additional six (6) months of Monthly Debt Service
into the Liquidity Reserve. Notwithstanding the foregoing, funds in the
Liquidity Reserve that were deposited as a result of the credit rating of
Guarantor shall be released to Borrower if Guarantor is rated "investment grade"
by both S&P and Moody's, provided, however, that if any such "investment grade"
rating is subsequently downgraded below "investment grade" or withdrawn by
either or both Rating Agencies, Borrower shall cause WESCO Tenant or Guarantor
to immediately deposit an additional amount equal to twelve (12) months of
Monthly Debt Service into the Liquidity Reserve.

         (b) If at any time during the term of the Loan, the Pending Litigation
Matter is scheduled for trial and there has been a final certification of a
collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Actl, Borrower shall cause
WESCO Tenant or Guarantor to immediately deposit an additional amount equal to
six (6) months of Monthly Debt Service into the Liquidity Reserve.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, funds in the Liquidity Reserve deposited in
connection with the Pending Litigation Matter shall be released to Borrower if
in connection with the Pending Litigation Matter, (i) a final, non-appealable
order or judgment declaring that the defendant has no liability is issued, (ii)
said matter is dismissed with prejudice and no payment is made by any defendant
in connection with such dismissal or (iii) Lender determines in its reasonable
discretion that any settlement or resolution of the Pending Litigation Matter
shall not materially adversely affect the condition (financial or otherwise) or
business of Borrower, WESCO Tenant or Guarantor or the condition or ownership of
any Individual Property.

<PAGE>

         7.4.3 LETTER OF CREDIT ALTERNATIVE TO CASH LIQUIDITY RESERVE. In lieu
of its requirements to deposit cash into the Liquidity Reserve Account to
satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.4, Borrower may in lieu thereof (a)
post a Tenant Letter of Credit in the amounts required under Section 7.4.2 or
(b) deliver evidence satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion that WESCO
Tenant has posted a Tenant Letter of Credit in the amounts required under
Section 7.4.2 as a security deposit for its performance under the WESCO Lease,
and Borrower's rights under the WESCO Lease in and to the Tenant Letter of
Credit have, in Lender's sole determination, been duly and unconditionally
assigned and transferred to Lender in connection with its assignment of the
WESCO Lease to Lender pursuant to the Assignment of Leases. Borrower shall also
immediately cause WESCO Tenant to increase the amount of the Tenant Letter of
Credit or obtain a replacement Tenant Letter of Credit in accordance with the
terms of the WESCO Lease, in the event the amount required to be deposited into
the Liquidity Reserve is increased pursuant to the terms of Section 7.4.2. The
WESCO Lease may provide that any interest which accrues on such security
deposit, if in the form of cash rather than in the form of a letter of credit,
shall be paid to WESCO Tenant and shall not be deemed a part of such security
deposit.

         SECTION 7.5 RESERVE FUNDS, GENERALLY.

         Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security interest
in each of the Reserve Funds and any and all monies now or hereafter deposited
in each Reserve Fund as additional security for payment of the Debt. Until
expended or applied in accordance herewith, the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Lender may, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available to
Lender, apply any sums then present in any or all of the Reserve Funds to the
payment of the Debt in any order in its sole discretion. The Reserve Funds shall
not constitute trust funds and may be commingled with other monies held by
Lender. The Reserve Funds shall be held in an Eligible Account in Permitted
Investments in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Cash Management
Agreement. All interest on a Reserve Fund shall not be added to or become a part
thereof and shall be the sole property of and shall be paid to Lender. Borrower
shall be responsible for payment of any federal, state or local income or other
tax applicable to the interest earned on the Reserve Funds. Borrower shall not,
without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or
grant any security interest in any Reserve Fund or the monies deposited therein
or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to be made
thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming Lender as the
secured party, to be filed with respect thereto. Lender shall not be liable for
any loss sustained on the investment of any funds constituting the Reserve
Funds. Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from and against
any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages,
obligations and costs and expenses (including litigation costs and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the
Reserve Funds or the performance of the obligations for which the Reserve Funds
were established. Borrower shall assign to Lender all rights and claims Borrower
may have against all persons or entities supplying labor, materials or other
services which are to be paid from or secured by the Reserve Funds; provided,
however, that Lender may not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event of
Default has occurred and remains uncured.

         violation of the provisions of this Agreement and Article 6 of any
         Mortgage;

                  (v)    if any representation or warranty made by Borrower

         furnished to Lender shall have been false or misleading in any material
         respect as of the date the representation or warranty was made;

                  (vi)   if Borrower, WESCO Tenant, Guarantor or any other
         guarantor under any guaranty issued in connection with the Loan shall
         make an assignment for the benefit of creditors;

                  (vii) if a receiver, liquidator or trustee shall be appointed

         Tenant, Guarantor or such other guarantor shall be adjudicated a
         bankrupt or insolvent, or if any petition for bankruptcy,

         such other guarantor, or if any proceeding for the dissolution or
         liquidation of Borrower, WESCO Tenant, Guarantor or such other
         guarantor shall be instituted; provided, however, if such appointment,
         adjudication, petition or proceeding was involuntary and not consented
         to by Borrower, WESCO Tenant, Guarantor or such other guarantor, upon
         the same not being discharged, stayed or dismissed within thirty (30)
         days;

                                      -82-

<PAGE>

                  (ix) if Borrower breaches any covenant contained in Section
         4.1.30 hereof;

                  (x)    with respect to any term, covenant or provision set
          forth herein which specifically contains a notice requirement or grace

          condition after the giving of such notice or the expiration of such
          grace period;

                  (xi)  if any of the assumptions contained in the Insolvency
         Opinion delivered to Lender in connection with the Loan, or in any
         Additional Insolvency Opinion delivered subsequent to the closing of
         the Loan, is or shall become untrue in any material respect;

                  (xii)  if a material default has occurred and continues beyond
         any applicable cure period under any Management Agreement (or any
         Replacement Management Agreement) and if such default permits the
         Manager thereunder to terminate or cancel any Management Agreement (or
         any Replacement Management Agreement);

                  (xiii) if Borrower shall continue to be in Default under any

         specified in subsections (i) to (xii) above, for ten (10) days after
         notice to Borrower from Lender, in the case of any Default which can be
         cured by the payment of a sum of money, or for thirty (30) days after
         notice from Lender in the case of any other Default; provided, however,
         that if such non-monetary Default is susceptible of cure but cannot
         reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and provided
         further that Borrower shall have commenced to cure such Default within
         such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously
         proceeds to cure the same, such thirty (30) day period shall be
         extended for such time as is reasonably necessary for Borrower in the
         exercise of due diligence to cure such Default, such additional period
         not to exceed sixty (60) days; or

                  (xiv)  if there shall be default under any of the other Loan
         Documents beyond any applicable cure periods contained in such
         documents, whether as to Borrower or any Individual Property, or if any
         other such event shall occur or condition shall exist, if the effect of
         such default, event or condition is to accelerate the maturity of any
         portion of the Debt or to permit Lender to accelerate the maturity of
         all or any portion of the Debt.

                  (xv)   If there is a default beyond all applicable notice and
         cure periods under the terms and conditions of the WESCO Lease by any
         party thereto.

         (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above) and at any time
thereafter, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, Lender
may take such action, without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to
protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to

                                      -83-

<PAGE>

all or any Individual Property, including, without limitation, declaring the
Debt to be immediately due and payable, and Lender may enforce or avail itself
of any or all rights or remedies provided in the Loan Documents against
Borrower and any or all of the Properties, including, without limitation, all
rights or remedies available at law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default
described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the Debt and Other
Obligations of Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall
immediately and automatically become due and payable, without notice or demand,
and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything
contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

         SECTION 8.2 REMEDIES.

         (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more
of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender
against Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity
may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not
all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not
Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the
enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with
respect to all or any part of any Individual Property. Any such actions taken
by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently,
singularly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order
as Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies
of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender is not
subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all
liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain
in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against
the Properties and each Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise
realized upon in satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

         (b) With respect to Borrower and the Properties, nothing contained
herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to
resort to any Individual Property for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in any
preference or priority to any other Individual Property, and Lender may seek
satisfaction out of all of the Properties, or any part thereof, in its absolute
discretion in respect of the Debt. In addition, Lender shall have the right from
time to time to partially foreclose the Mortgages in any manner and for any
amounts secured by the Mortgages then due and payable as determined by Lender in
its sole discretion including, without limitation, the following circumstances:
(i) in the event Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the
payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may
foreclose one or more of the Mortgages to recover such delinquent payments or
(ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding
principal balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages
to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate
and such other sums secured by one or more of the Mortgages as Lender may elect.
Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Property shall remain
subject to the

                                      -84-

<PAGE>

Mortgages to secure payment of sums secured by the Mortgages and not previously
recovered.

         (c) Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note and
the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other
security documents (the "SEVERED LOAN DOCUMENTS") in such denominations as
Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and
enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and
deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a
severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to
effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and
irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its
said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not
make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) days after
notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender's intent to exercise its
rights under such power. Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any third party
costs or expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution,
recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents and the Severed Loan Documents
shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants not contained in
the Loan Documents and any such representations and warranties contained in the
Severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower only as of the Closing Date.

         SECTION 8.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS.

         The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's rights, powers
and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time
and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay
or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver
of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any
remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

         IX. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 9.1 SALE OF NOTES AND SECURITIZATION.

         Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lender may sell all or any
portion of the Loan and the Loan Documents, or issue one or more participations
therein, or consummate one or more private or public securitizations of rated
single- or multi-class securities (the "SECURITIES") secured by or evidencing
ownership interests in all or any portion of the Loan and the Loan Documents or
a pool of assets that include the Loan and the Loan Documents (such sales,
participations and/or securitizations, collectively, a "SECURITIZATION"). At the
request of

without limitation, to:

         (a) provide additional and/or updated Provided Information, together

organizational documents for Borrower, which counsel opinions and organizational
documents shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender, prospective investors
and/or the Rating Agencies;

         (d) if required by any prospective investor and/or any Rating Agency,

letters, subordination agreements or other agreements from parties to agreements
that affect the Property, which estoppel letters, subordination agreements or
other agreements shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender, prospective
investors and/or the Rating Agencies;

         (e) make such representations and warranties as of the Closing Date,
the Securitization with respect to the Property, Borrower, the WESCO Tenant,
Guarantor and the Loan Documents as may be reasonably requested by Lender,
prospective investors and/or the Rating Agencies and consistent with the facts
covered by such representations and warranties as they exist on the date
thereof, including the representations and warranties made in the Loan
Documents;

         (f) execute such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be requested
by Lender, prospective investors and/or the Rating Agencies to effect the
Securitization;

         (g) if requested by Lender, review any information regarding the
Property, Borrower, Guarantor, Manager and the Loan which is contained in a
preliminary or final private placement memorandum, prospectus, prospectus
supplement (including any amendment or supplement to either thereof), or other
disclosure document to be used by Lender or any affiliate thereof; and

         (h) supply to Lender such documentation, financial statements and
reports in form and substance required in order to comply with any applicable
securities laws.

         9.1.2 LOAN COMPONENTS. Borrower covenants and agrees that in connection
with any Securitization of the Loan, upon Lender's request Borrower shall
deliver one or more new component notes to replace the original note or modify
the original note to reflect multiple components of the Loan (and such new notes
or modified note shall have the same initial weighted average coupon as the
original note, but such new notes or modified note may subsequently change the
weighted average coupon and apply principal, interest rates and amortization of
the Loan between the components in a manner specified by Lender in its sole
discretion) and modify the Cash Management Agreement with respect to the newly
created components such that the pricing and marketability of the Securities and
the size of each class of Securities and the rating assigned to each such class
by the Rating Agencies shall provide the most favorable rating levels and
achieve the optimum rating levels for the Loan.

         9.1.3 SECURITIZATION COSTS. All reasonable third party costs and
expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with Borrower's complying with
requests made under this Section 9.1 (including, without limitation, the fees
and expenses of the Rating Agencies) shall be paid by Lender.

         SECTION 9.2 INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 9.3 EXCULPATION.

         Subject to the qualifications below, Lender shall not enforce the
liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the obligations
contained in the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents
by any action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against
Borrower, except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, an action for
specific performance or any other appropriate action or proceeding to enable
Lender to enforce and realize upon its interest under the Note, this Agreement,
the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, or in the Properties, the Rents, or
any other collateral given to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents; provided,
however, that, except as specifically provided herein, any judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of
Borrower's interest in the Properties, in the Rents and in any other collateral
given to Lender, and Lender, by accepting the Note, this Agreement, the
Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, agrees that it shall not sue for, seek
or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower in any such action or
proceeding under or by reason of or under or in connection with the Note, this
Agreement, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this
Section shall not, however, (a) constitute a waiver, release or impairment of
any obligation evidenced or secured by any of the Loan Documents; (b) impair the
right of Lender to name Borrower as a party defendant in any action or suit for
foreclosure and sale under any of the Mortgages; (c) affect the validity or
enforceability of or any guaranty made in connection with the Loan or any of the
rights and remedies of Lender thereunder; (d) impair the right of Lender to
obtain the appointment of a receiver; (e) impair the enforcement of any of the

deficiency judgment against Borrower in order to fully realize the security
granted by each of the Mortgages or to commence any other appropriate action or
proceeding in order for Lender to exercise its remedies against all of the
Properties; or (g) constitute a waiver of the right of Lender to enforce the
liability and obligation of Borrower, by money judgment or otherwise, to the
extent of any

                                      -87-

loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or other obligation incurred by
Lender (including attorneys' fees and costs reasonably incurred) arising out of
or in connection with the following:

                  (i)    fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower or
         Guarantor in connection with the Loan;

                  (ii)   the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Borrower;

                  (iii)  the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
         indemnification provision in the Environmental Indemnity Agreement or
         in the Mortgages concerning environmental laws, hazardous substances
         and asbestos and any indemnification of Lender with respect thereto in
         either document;

                  (iv)   the removal or disposal of any portion of the
         Properties after an Event of Default;

                  (vi)   failure to pay charges for labor or materials or other
         charges that can create Liens on any portion of the Properties;

                  (vii)  any security deposits, advance deposits or any other
         deposits collected with respect to the Properties which are not
         delivered to Lender upon a foreclosure of the Properties or action in
         lieu thereof, except to the extent any such security deposits were
         applied in accordance with the terms and conditions of any of the
         Leases prior to the occurrence of the Event of Default that gave rise
         to such foreclosure or action in lieu thereof;

                  (viii) failure to comply with the obligations set forth in
         Section 2(e) of that certain Letter Agreement dated as of the date

any other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount
of the Debt secured by the Mortgages or to require that all collateral shall

due; (ii) if the first full monthly payment of principal and interest on the
Note is not paid when due; (iii) if Borrower fails to permit on-site
inspections of the Properties, fails to provide financial information, fails to
maintain its status as a Single Purpose Entity or fails to appoint a new

written consent to any Indebtedness or voluntary Lien encumbering the

         SECTION 10.11 WAIVER OF NOTICE.

         Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan

                                      -93-

<PAGE>

Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

         SECTION 10.12 REMEDIES OF BORROWER.

         In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment.

         SECTION 10.13 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

         (a) Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay,
to reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by Lender in connection with (i) the preparation,
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and all the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower
(including without limitation any opinions requested by Lender as to any legal
matters arising under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with respect to
the Properties); (ii) Borrower's ongoing performance of and compliance with
Borrower's respective agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the
Closing Date, including, without limitation, confirming compliance with
environmental and insurance requirements; (iii) Lender's ongoing performance and
compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the
Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
administration of any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents or matters
requested by Lender; (v) securing Borrower's compliance with any requests made
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; (vi) the filing and recording fees
and expenses, title insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
providing to Lender all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses
incurred in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor of Lender pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing or preserving any
rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any
action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case against, under or
affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Properties, or
any other security given for the Loan; and (viii) enforcing any obligations of
or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or with respect to the Properties (including any fees incurred by
Servicer in connection with the transfer of the Loan to a special servicer prior
to a Default or Event of Default) or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; provided,
however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the payment of any such costs and

                                      -94-

<PAGE>

expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal
acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender. Any cost and expenses due and
payable to Lender may be paid from any amounts in the Cash Management Account.

         (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for Lender in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not
Lender shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against Lender in any manner relating to or arising out of (i)
any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower
shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such
Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or
willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Lender.

         (c) Borrower covenants and agrees to pay for or, if Borrower fails to
pay, to reimburse Lender for, any fees and expenses incurred by any consent,
approval, waiver or confirmation obtained from any Rating Agency pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and Lender
shall be entitled to require payment of such fees and expenses as a condition
precedent to the obtaining of any such consent, approval, waiver or
confirmation.

         SECTION 10.14 SCHEDULES INCORPORATED.

         The Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part
of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

         SECTION 10.15 OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES.

         Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower
may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated
counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any
action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any
such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

         SECTION 10.16 NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES.

                                      -95-

<PAGE>

         (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender.
Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership,
tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor
to grant Lender any interest in the Properties other than that of mortgagee,
beneficiary or lender.

         (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

         SECTION 10.17 PUBLICITY.

         All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower, Lender or
either of its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public
which refers to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan
Documents shall be subject to the prior written approval of the other party,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         SECTION 10.18 CROSS-DEFAULT; CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION; WAIVER OF
MARSHALLING OF ASSETS.

         (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower
   upon the security of its collective interest in the Properties and in
   reliance upon the aggregate of the Properties taken together being of greater
   value as collateral security than the sum of each Individual Property taken
   separately. Borrower agrees that the Mortgages are and will be
   cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event
   of Default under any of the Mortgages shall constitute an Event of Default
   under each of the other Mortgages which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of
   Default under the Note or this Loan Agreement shall constitute an Event of
   Default under each Mortgage; (iii) each Mortgage shall constitute security
   for the Note as if a single blanket lien were placed on all of the Properties
   as security for the Note; and (iv) such cross-collateralization shall in no
   event be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance.

         (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and
   its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets
   of Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and
   of the Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event
   of foreclosure of all or any of the Mortgages,, and agrees not to assert any
   right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in
   inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of
   estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or
   affect the right of Lender under the Loan

                                      -96-

<PAGE>

   Documents to a sale of the Properties for the collection of the Debt without
   any prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
   payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Properties in preference
   to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, Borrower, for itself and its
   successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any or all of
   the Mortgages, any equitable right otherwise available to Borrower which
   would require the separate sale of the Properties or require Lender to
   exhaust its remedies against any Individual Property or any combination of
   the Properties before proceeding against any other Individual Property or
   combination of Properties; and further in the event of such foreclosure
   Borrower does hereby expressly consents to and authorizes, at the option of
   Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any
   combination of the Properties.

         SECTION 10.19 WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM.

         Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

         SECTION 10.20 CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE.

         In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which
govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower,
and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take
any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of
any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the
business of real estate financings and other real estate transactions and
investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business
of Borrower or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 10.21 BROKERS AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

         Borrower hereby represents that it has dealt with no financial
advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except L.J.
Melody & Co. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender
harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of
any kind (including Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in any way
relating to or arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on
behalf of Borrower or Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein. The provisions of this Section 10.21 shall survive the expiration and
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Debt.

         SECTION 10.22 PRIOR AGREEMENTS.

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written, including, without limitation, the Commitment
Letter dated November 12, 2002 (as amended) between Borrower and Lender with
respect to the financing of the Properties are superseded by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 10.23 JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.

         If Borrower consists of more than one (1) Person the obligations and
liabilities of each Person shall be joint and several.
