apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;5.1.2</U> and under the Security Instrument. In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance
Escrow Fund, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill,
statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;5.1.2</U>, Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund
after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. In allocating such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender to be the owner of the Property. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax
and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a)&nbsp;and (b)&nbsp;above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly payments
to Lender by the amount that Lender reasonably estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the due date of the Taxes and thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.
