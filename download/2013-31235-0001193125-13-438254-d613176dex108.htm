wishing to participate in such Auction shall, prior to the Expiration Time, provide the Auction Manager with an irrevocable notice of participation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Auction Manager (the &#147;<B>Return
Bid</B>&#148;, to be included in the Offer Documents) which shall specify (i)&nbsp;a discount to par that must be expressed as a price per $1,000 of Term Loans (the &#147;<B>Reply Price</B>&#148;) within the Discount Range and (ii)&nbsp;the
principal amount of Term Loans, in an amount not less than $1,000,000, that such Lender is willing to offer for sale at its Reply Price (the &#147;<B>Reply Amount</B>&#148;); <I>provided</I>, that each Lender may submit a Reply Amount that is less
than the minimum amount and incremental amount requirements described above only if the Reply Amount comprises the entire amount of the Term Loans held by such Lender at such time. A Lender may only submit one Return Bid per Auction, but each Return
Bid may contain up to three component bids, each of which may result in a separate Qualifying Bid (as defined below) and each of which will not be contingent on any other component bid submitted by such Lender resulting in a Qualifying Bid. In
addition to the Return Bid, a participating Lender must execute and deliver, to be held by the Auction Manager, an assignment and acceptance in the form included in the Offer Documents which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Auction Manager and the Administrative Agent (the &#147;<B>Affiliate Assignment Agreement</B>&#148;). The Offeror will not purchase any Term Loans at a price that is outside of the applicable Discount Range, nor will any Return Bids (including
any component bids specified therein) submitted at a price that is outside such applicable Discount Range be considered in any calculation of the Applicable Threshold Price (as defined below). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U><B>Acceptance Procedures</B>.</U> Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received by the Auction Manager, the Auction Manager, in
consultation with the Offeror, will calculate the lowest purchase price (the &#147;<B>Applicable Threshold Price</B>&#148;) for the Auction within the Discount Range for the Auction that will allow the Offeror to complete the Auction by purchasing
the full Auction Amount (or such lesser amount of Term Loans for which the Offeror has received Qualifying Bids). The Offeror shall purchase (by assignment) Term Loans from each Lender whose Return Bid is within the Discount Range and contains a
Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Threshold Price (each, a &#147;<B>Qualifying Bid</B>&#148;). The principal amount of all Term Loans included in Qualifying Bids received at a Reply Price lower than the Applicable Threshold
Price will be purchased at a purchase price equal to the applicable Reply Price and shall not be subject to proration. If a Lender has submitted a Return Bid containing multiple component bids at different Reply Prices, then all Term Loans of such
Lender offered in any such component bid that constitutes a Qualifying Bid with a Reply Price lower than the Applicable Threshold Price shall also be purchased (to the extent the Auction is consummated) at a purchase price equal to the applicable
Reply Price and shall not be subject to proration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U><B>Allocation Procedures</B>.</U> All Term Loans offered in Return Bids (or, if
applicable, any component bid thereof) constituting Qualifying Bids equal to the Applicable Threshold Price will be purchased at a purchase price equal to the Applicable Threshold Price; <I>provided</I> that if the aggregate principal amount of all
Term Loans for which Qualifying Bids have been submitted in any given Auction equal to the Applicable Threshold Price would exceed the remaining portion of the Auction Amount (after deducting all Term Loans purchased below the Applicable Threshold
Price), the Offeror shall purchase the Term Loans for which the Qualifying Bids submitted were at the Applicable Threshold Price ratably based on the respective principal amounts offered and in an aggregate amount up to the amount

necessary to complete the purchase of the Auction Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, no Return Bids (or any component thereof) will be accepted above the Applicable Threshold Price. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U><B>Notification Procedures</B>.</U> The Auction Manager, in consultation with the Offeror, will calculate the Applicable Threshold Price no
later than the next Business Day after the date that the Return Bids were due. The Auction Manager will insert the amount of Term Loans to be assigned and the applicable settlement date determined by the Auction Manager in consultation with the
Offeror onto each applicable Affiliate Assignment Agreement received in connection with a Qualifying Bid. Upon written request of the submitting Lender, the Auction Manager will promptly return any Affiliate Assignment Agreement received in
connection with a Return Bid that is not a Qualifying Bid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><U>Additional Procedures.</U></B> Once initiated by an Auction Notice, the
Offeror may withdraw an Auction by written notice to the Auction Manager so long as no Qualifying Bids have been received by the Auction Manager at or prior to the time the Auction Manager receives such written notice; <I>provided</I> that that the
Offeror&#146;s obligation to purchase Term Loans from any Lender shall be conditioned on (i)&nbsp;such Lender making the representations and warranties set forth in the Affiliate Assignment Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;there being no pending actions,
suits or proceedings pending or threatened, in each case brought by a third party, in writing that seek to enjoin such Auction. Furthermore, in connection with any Auction, upon submission by a Lender of a Return Bid, such Lender will not have any
withdrawal rights. Any Return Bid (including any component bid thereof) delivered to the Auction Manager may not be modified, revoked, terminated or cancelled; <I>provided</I> that a Lender may modify a Return Bid at any time prior to the Expiration
Time solely to reduce the Reply Price included in such Return Bid. However, an Auction shall become void if the Offeror fails to satisfy one or more of the conditions to the purchase of Term Loans set forth in Section&nbsp;9.04(b) of the Credit
Agreement, as applicable, or to otherwise comply with any of the provisions of such Section&nbsp;9.04(b). The purchase price for all Term Loans purchased in an Auction shall be paid in cash by the Offeror directly to the respective assigning Lender
on a settlement date as determined by the Auction Manager in consultation with the Offeror (which shall be no later than ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after the date Return Bids are due). The Offeror shall execute each applicable Affiliate Assignment
Agreement received in connection with a Qualifying Bid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All questions as to the form of documents and validity and eligibility of Term
Loans that are the subject of an Auction will be determined by the Auction Manager in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, in consultation with the Offeror, and the Auction Manager&#146;s determination will be conclusive, absent manifest
error. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">None of the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager, any other agent or any of their respective affiliates assumes any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the Borrower or its Subsidiaries contained in the Offer Documents or otherwise or for any failure to disclose events that may have occurred and may affect the significance
or accuracy of such information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Auction Manager acting in its capacity as such under an Auction shall be entitled to the benefits of
the provisions of Article&nbsp;8 and Section&nbsp;9.03 of the Credit Agreement to the same extent as if each reference therein to the &#147;Administrative Agent&#148; were a reference to the Auction Manager, and the Administrative Agent shall
cooperate with the Auction Manager as reasonably requested by the Auction Manager in order to enable it to perform its responsibilities and duties in connection with each Auction. </P>
