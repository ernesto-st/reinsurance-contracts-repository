<p><b><font size=3>EXCESS BOND TO SECURE PREMIUM
AND DEDUCTIBLE OBLIGATIONS</font></b></p>

<p><font size=3>Bond Number </font><u><font>45032750</font></u></p>

<p><font size=3>KNOW ALL MEN BY
THESE PRESENTS:</font></p>

<p><font size=3>That Labor
Ready, Inc., as Principal ('Principal') and Greenwich Insurance Company, as
Surety ('Surety'), are held and firmly bound unto Mutual Indemnity (U.S.) Ltd.,
Legion Insurance Company and each of its affiliates and subsidiaries, as
Obligee (herein collectively and individually referred to as 'Obligee') for the
payment of the Obligations (hereafter defined), up to the maximum penal sum of
Seven Million Five Hundred Sixty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars </font><font>($7,560,000.00***)
lawful </font><font>money of the United States for payment of
which sum, Principal and Surety hereby bind themselves, their successors and
assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.</font></p>

<p><font size=3>WHEREAS, Obligee
has issued certain insurance policies on behalf of the Principal and has
entered into certain other agreements with the Principal which are described on
Exhibit A hereto and as may be amended and/or renewed from time to time (herein
collectively referred to as the 'Agreement(s)'), and;</font></p>

<p><font size=3>WHEREAS, the
Obligee requires security for the Principal's Obligations to Obligee under each
of the Agreements ('Obligations'), and;</font></p>

<p><font size=3>WHEREAS, the
Obligee currently holds, or will hold, security for the Obligations
('Underlying Security') and now desires &quot;excess&#148; security, and;</font></p>

<p><font size=3>WHEREAS, such
excess security will not be liquidated until all other forms of Underlying
Security for the Obligations have been liquidated.</font></p>

<p><font size=3>NOW, THEREFORE,
if and when the Obligations shall be fully and finally paid and satisfied, this
Excess Bond shall be null and void, otherwise this Excess Bond shall remain in
full force and effect and Principal and Surety in any event agree as follows:</font></p>

  <td width=947 valign=top>
  <font size=3>Within ten (10) business days of Surety's
  receipt of a demand for payment under this Excess Bond (&quot;Demand'),
  Surety shall pay to the Obligee the amount of such Demand. The Obligee's
  Demand to the Surety of the amount due, either as security or for payment or
  for reimbursement of Obligations pursuant to the Agreement(s), shall be
  absolute proof of the existence and extent of the liability of the Principal
  and the Surety to the Obligee hereunder. The Obligee may present one or more
  Demands at any time in its sole discretion, provided, however, Surety shall
  not be obligated to pay an aggregate amount in excess of the penal sum of the
  Excess Bond.<br><br></font>

  <font size=3>In the event that Obligee shall demand either
  a portion of the penal sum of the Excess Bond or the entire penal sum of the
  Excess Bond (less any previous amounts paid to Obligee under the Excess Bond)
  under a Demand, Obligee shall hold all funds (&quot;Excess Bond Collateral')
  received as security for the Obligations and shall apply such Excess Bond
  Collateral to the Obligations from time to time in its sole discretion;
  provided, however, that the Obligee shall not apply such Excess Bond
  Collateral to the Obligations until the full amount of all Underlying
  Security has been applied to the Obligations. At such time as Obligee
  determines in its sole discretion that all of the Obligations are fully and
  finally paid and such payment is not subject to avoidance or other turnover,
  Obligee shall return to the Surety the unapplied portion of the Excess Bond
  Collateral. The Surety, whether in its capacity as Surety or subrogee of the
  Principal, waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
  and every right which it may have to contest Obligee's computation of the
  Obligations or the application of the Excess Bond Collateral by the Obligee to
  the Obligations, and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
  law, each and every right which it </font><font>may have to seek reimbursement,
  restitution or recovery of any Excess Bond Collateral. Obligee shall not be
  required to (i) segregate Excess Bond Collateral from its general funds, (ii)
  hold or invest Excess Bond Collateral in an interest-bearing or
  income-producing investment, or (iii) account to Surety for interest or
  income in the event the same would be, otherwise attributable to Excess Bond
  Collateral. The Principal shall not at any time have any rights or property
  interests in this Excess Bond, the Excess Bond Collateral or other proceeds
  of this Excess Bond.<br><br></font>

  notification provided that, the penal sum of the Excess Bond may not be
  increased without the consent of Surety; however, failure to give such
  consent will not prevent Obligee from drawing up to the full amount of the
  Excess Bond (less any previous amounts paid to Obligee under the Excess Bond)
