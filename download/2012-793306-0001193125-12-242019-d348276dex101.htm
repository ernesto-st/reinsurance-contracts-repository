hereunder, including the obligation to make Advances, are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Borrower and Borrower&#146;s successors and assigns and no other person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in
accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make advances in the absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of such
conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by the Lender at any time if in its sole discretion it deems it desirable to do so. In particular, Lender makes no representations and assumes no duties or obligations as to
third parties concerning the quality of the construction by Borrower or the Improvements or the absence therefrom of defects. In this connection, Borrower agrees to and shall indemnify Lender from any liability, claims or losses resulting from the
disbursement of the Loan proceeds or from the condition of the Improvements whether related to the quality of construction or otherwise and whether arising during or after the term of the Loan. This provision shall survive the repayment of said Loan
and shall continue in full force and effect so long as the possibility of such liability, claims, or losses exists. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT

condition the existence or nonexistence, as the case may be, of such fact or facts, and Lender shall, at all times, be free to independently establish to its satisfaction and in its absolute discretion such existence or nonexistence. </FONT></P>

obligation to make further Advances nor, in the event Borrower is unable to satisfy any such condition, shall any such waiver have the effect of precluding Lender from thereafter declaring such inability to be a Default. In addition, any waiver of
any provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other provision, and shall not act as a future waiver of any provision of the Agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

Industry Guaranteed Loan be approved to cover such costs. Furthermore, Borrower will not divert Loan funds from purposes identified in Section&nbsp;2.2 of this Agreement for any of the aforementioned items without the express written approval of
RBS. Failure to comply with the terms of this paragraph will be considered a material adverse change in the Borrower&#146;s financial condition and a default under the Loan. In the event any of the aforementioned increases in costs and/or expenses
are incurred by the Borrower, the Borrower must provide for such increases in a manner that there is no diminution of the Borrower&#146;s operating capital. </FONT></P>

law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the holder hereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full (including the period of any renewal or extension hereof) so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate. </FONT></P>
