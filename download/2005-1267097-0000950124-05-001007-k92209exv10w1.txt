            For purposes of the foregoing, (a) the Leverage Ratio shall be
determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter of the U.S. Borrower's fiscal
year based upon the consolidated financial information of the U.S. Borrower and
the Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(a) or (b) and (b) each
change in the Applicable Margin resulting from a change in the Leverage Ratio
shall be effective during the period commencing on and including the first
Business Day after the date of delivery to the Administrative Agent of such
consolidated financial information indicating such change and ending on the date
immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change; provided that
the Leverage Ratio shall be deemed to be in Category 1 (i) at any time that an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or (ii) at the option of the
Administrative Agent or at the request of the Required Lenders, if the U.S.
Borrower fails to deliver the consolidated financial information required to be
delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(a) or (b), during the period from the
expiration of the time for delivery thereof until such consolidated financial
information is delivered.

            For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either S&P or Moody's shall
not have in effect a rating for the Facilities (other than by reason of the
circumstances referred to in the following sentence), then such rating agency
(or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, both rating
agencies) will have deemed to have established a rating for the Facilities that
is below BB+ (in the case of S&P) or below Ba1 (in the case of Moody's) and (ii)
if any rating established or deemed to have been established by S&P or Moody's
shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of
either S&P or Moody's), such change shall be effective as of the date on which
such change is first announced by the rating agency making such change. If the
rating system of S&P or Moody's shall change, or if either such rating agency
shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the U.S.
Borrower and the Required Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the non-availability of
ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such
amendment, the rating of such rating agency shall be determined by reference to
the rating most recently in effect from such rating agency prior to such change
or cessation.

            For purposes of the Tranche A-1 Term Loans, Tranche D-1 Term Loans,
Tranche D-2 Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Tranche E Term Loans, in the
event the ratings established or deemed to have been established by S&P or
Moody's for the Facilities and the Leverage Ratio shall fall in different

      references in this Agreement to minimum amounts (or integral multiples
      thereof) denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of
      the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the
      Closing Date shall, immediately upon such adoption, be replaced by
      references to such minimum amounts (or integral multiples thereof) as
      shall be specified herein with respect to Borrowings denominated in Euros.

      by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market
      conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

                  (b) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
at the Effective Funding Time (A) each Lender agrees to convert all or a portion
of its Tranche A-1 Term Loans into a principal amount of Tranche A Term Loans
equal to the principal amount of Tranche A-1 Term Loans so converted (or,
pursuant to clause (ii) below, to make Tranche A Term Loans to the U.S.
Borrower) in a principal amount equal to the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment of
such Lender and (B) each Lender agrees to convert all or a portion of its

the principal amount of Tranche D-1 Term Loans so converted (or, pursuant to
clause (ii) below, to make Tranche B Term Loans to the U.S. Borrower) in a
principal amount equal to the Tranche B Term Loan Commitment of such Lender.

            (ii) It is understood and agreed that (A) any Lender that holds any
Tranche A-1 Term Loans may elect, by delivering notice to the Administrative
Agent, to make Tranche A Term Loans to the U.S. Borrower at the Effective
Funding Time in a principal amount equal to (x) the Tranche A Term Loan
Commitment of such Lender minus (y) the aggregate principal amount of Tranche
A-1 Term Loans of such Lender being converted into Tranche A Term Loans
hereunder and (B) any Lender that holds any Tranche D-1 Term Loans may elect, by
delivering notice to the Administrative Agent, to make Tranche B Term Loans to

            (iii) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) each
Lender that does not hold any Tranche A-1 Term Loans agrees to make a Tranche A
Term Loan to the U.S. Borrower at the Effective Funding Time in a principal
amount equal to the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment of such Lender and (B) each
Lender that does not hold any Tranche D-1 Term Loans agrees to make a Tranche B
Term Loan to the U.S. Borrower in a principal amount equal to the Tranche B Term
Loan Commitment of such Lender.

            (iv) Each reference in this Agreement to the "making" of any Tranche
A Term Loan or Tranche B Term Loan, or words of similar import, shall, in the
case of such Lender, be deemed to include each conversion of Tranche A-1 Term
Loans and Tranche D-1 Term Loans pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that the Tranche A
Term Loans and Tranche B Term Loans into which the Tranche A-1 Term Loans and
Tranche D-1 Term Loans are so converted shall be treated identically to the
Tranche A Term Loans and Tranche B Term Loans being funded (and not being
converted) at the Effective Funding Time and shall have identical Interest
Periods in identical proportions and durations as all other Tranche A Term Loans
or Tranche B Term Loans, as applicable (and, for these purposes, any Interest
Periods for Tranche A-1 Term Loans or Tranche D-1 Term Loans that are
Eurocurrency Term Loans in effect at the Effective Funding Time shall be
terminated at the Effective Funding Time, and any such converting Lender shall
be paid accrued interest on its Tranche A-1 Term Loans and Tranche D-1 Term
Loans being so converted, together with any amounts payable under Section 2.16,
as if the Tranche A-1 Term Loans or Tranche D-1 Term Loans, as the case may be,
were being prepaid in full at the Effective Funding Time).

                  (c) All Tranche A-1 Term Loans, Tranche D Term Loans, Tranche
      E Term Loans and Existing Revolving Loans outstanding under the Existing
      Credit Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date shall remain
      outstanding hereunder on the terms set forth herein until the Effective
      Funding Time. At the Effective Funding Time, (i) all Tranche A-1 Term
      Loans, Tranche D Term Loans and Existing Revolving Loans will be converted
      or repaid as provided herein and (ii) all Tranche E Term Loans outstanding
      at such time shall remain outstanding hereunder on the terms set forth
      herein.

                  (d) Amounts repaid in respect of Term Loans may not be
      reborrowed.

            SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan shall be made as
part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans under

<PAGE>

                                                                              83

the same Facility and of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Commitments under the applicable Facility (or, in the case
of Swingline Loans, in accordance with their respective Swingline Dollar
Commitments or Swingline Foreign Currency Commitments, as applicable); provided,
however, that Global Revolving Facility Loans under the Global Revolving
Facility shall be made by the Global Revolving Facility Lenders ratably in
accordance with their respective Available Unused Commitments on the date such
Loans are made hereunder. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to
be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

                  (b) Subject to Section 2.14, (i) each Borrowing denominated in
      Dollars (other than a Swingline Dollar Borrowing) shall be comprised
      entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the applicable Borrower may
      request in accordance herewith and (ii) each Borrowing denominated in a
      Foreign Currency (other than a Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing) shall
      be comprised entirely of Eurocurrency Loans. Each Swingline Dollar
      Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. Each Swingline Foreign Currency
      Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of Swingline Foreign Currency Loans.
      Each Lender at its option may make any ABR Loan or Eurocurrency Loan by
      causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make
      such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the
      obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance
      with the terms of this Agreement and such Lender shall not be entitled to
      any amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.21 solely in respect of
      increased costs resulting from such exercise.

                  (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
      Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
      amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less
      than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that a Eurocurrency Revolving
      Borrowing that is an Ancillary Replacement Borrowing shall be permitted to
      be in an amount necessary to finance Ancillary Credit Extensions under an
      Ancillary Facility being terminated pursuant to Section 2.22(e). At the
      time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in
      an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple
      and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that an ABR Revolving
      Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire

                                                                              84

      unused balance of the U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments or that is
      required to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as
      contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each Swingline Dollar Borrowing and
      Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing shall be in an amount that is an
      integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the
      Borrowing Minimum. Borrowings of more than one Type and under more than
      one Facility may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there
      shall not at any time be more than a total of (i) 10 Eurocurrency
      Borrowings outstanding under each of the Tranche A Facility, the Tranche
      A-1 Facility, the Tranche B Facility, the Tranche D-1 Facility, Tranche
      D-2 Facility and the Tranche E Facility and (ii) 35 Eurocurrency
      Borrowings outstanding under each of the Global Revolving Facility and the
      U.S. Revolving Facility (not including Ancillary Replacement Borrowings).

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
      Borrower shall be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
      any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would
      end after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, Tranche A Maturity Date,
      Tranche A-1 Maturity Date, Tranche B Maturity Date, Tranche D Maturity
      Date or Tranche E Maturity Date, as applicable.

            SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. Except in the case of an

request a Revolving Borrowing, the applicable Borrower shall notify the

                  (vi) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars,
            whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency
            Borrowing;

                  (vii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial

            Period"; and

                  (viii) the location and number of the applicable Borrower's

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing, unless such Global
Revolving Facility Borrowing (i) is denominated in a Foreign Currency and (ii)
is being requested by a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, in which case such Global
Revolving Facility Borrowing shall be a Eurocurrency Borrowing. If no Interest

the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part
of the requested Borrowing.

Revolving Facility Commitments and (ii) each Swingline Foreign Currency Lender
agrees to make Swingline Foreign Currency Loans to the Foreign Subsidiary

            Local Time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Dollar Borrowing or
            Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing. Each such notice and Swingline
            Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) in the
            case of a Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing, the Borrower
            requesting such Borrowing, (ii) the requested date (which shall be a

            Revolving Facility Lender's ratable share (based on Available Unused
            Commitments), as applicable, of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each
            U.S. Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
            agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the
            Applicable Agent, for the account of the applicable Swingline Dollar

            Facility Percentage of such Swingline Dollar Loan or Loans. Each
            Global Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and
            unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to

            Facility Lender and each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges
            and agrees that its respective obligation to acquire participations
            in Swingline Foreign Currency Loans and Swingline Dollar Loans, as
            applicable, pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional
            and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including
            the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
            termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be
            made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
            whatsoever. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall comply with its
            obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately
            available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with
            respect to Loans made by such Revolving Credit Lender (and Section
            2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of
            the Lenders), and the Applicable Agent shall promptly pay to the
            applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
            Revolving Credit Lenders. The Applicable Agent shall notify the
            applicable Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan
            acquired pursuant to this paragraph (c), and thereafter payments in
            respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Applicable Agent
            and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by
            a Swingline Lender from the applicable Borrower (or other party on
            behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after
            receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of
            participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Applicable
            Agent; any such amounts received by the Applicable Agent shall be
            promptly remitted by the Applicable Agent to the Revolving Credit
            Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this
            paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may
            appear; provided that any such payment so remitted

                                                                              89

            shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to the Applicable Agent,
            as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be
            refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. The purchase of
            participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall
            not relieve the applicable Borrower of any default in the payment
            thereof.

                  SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the
      terms and conditions set forth herein, each Borrower may request the

      to the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during
      the Availability Period and prior to the date that is five Business Days
      prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. In the event of any
      inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
      terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other
      agreement submitted by the Applicant Party to, or entered into by the
      Applicant Party with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit,
      the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Each Letter of
      Credit outstanding at the Effective Funding Time shall remain outstanding
      hereunder on the terms set forth herein.

                        (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
            Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit
            (or the amendment, renewal (other than an automatic renewal in
            accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section) or extension of an
            outstanding Letter of Credit), the Applicant Party shall hand
            deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
            arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable
            Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative
            Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance,
            amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of
            a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be
            amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
            amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the
            date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply
            with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of
            Credit, (subject to paragraph (n) of this Section) the currency in
            which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated, the name and
            address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as
            shall be necessary to issue, amend, renew or extend such Letter of
            Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Applicant
            Party also shall submit a letter of credit

<PAGE>
                                                                              90

            application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with
            any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be
            issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
            amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the
            Applicant Party shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
            after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
            extension (i) the Revolving L/C Exposure shall not exceed
            $250,000,000 and (ii) the U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure
            shall not exceed the total U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments.

                        (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire
            at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date
            one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit
            (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after
            such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business
            Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date; provided that any
            Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the automatic
            renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which, in no event,
            shall extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) of this
            paragraph (c)).

                        (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of
            Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount
            thereof) and without any further action on the part of the
            applicable Issuing Bank or the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders, such
            Issuing Bank hereby grants to each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender,
            and each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender hereby acquires from such
            Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
            U.S. Revolving Facility Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage
            of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
            Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each
            U.S. Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
            agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, for the
            account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such U.S. Revolving Facility
            Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of (i) each L/C
            Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank in Dollars and (ii) the
            Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as
            of the date such payment is required, of each L/C Disbursement made
            by such Issuing Bank in a Foreign Currency and, in each case, not
            reimbursed by the U.S. Borrower on the date due as provided in
            paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment
            required to be refunded to the U.S. Borrower for any reason (or, if
            such reimbursement payment was refunded in a Foreign

<PAGE>
                                                                              91

            Currency, the Dollar Equivalent thereof determined using the
            Exchange Rates calculated as of the date of such refund). Each U.S.
            Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
            obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in
            respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall
            not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
            amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the
            occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination
            of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
            any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                        (e) Reimbursement. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall
            make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the U.S.
            Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement by paying to the
            Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement in
            Dollars or (subject to the immediately succeeding sentence) the
            applicable Foreign Currency, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City
            time, on the Business Day immediately following the date the U.S.
            Borrower receives notice under paragraph (g) of this Section of such
            L/C Disbursement, provided that in the case of any L/C Disbursement
            made in Dollars with respect to a Letter of Credit issued for the
            account of the U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Borrower may, subject to the
            conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
            Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR
            Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Dollar Borrowing, as applicable,
            in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the U.S.
            Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
            replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline
            Dollar Borrowing. If the U.S. Borrower fails to reimburse any L/C
            Disbursement when due, then (i) if such payment relates to a Foreign
            Currency Letter of Credit, automatically and with no further action
            required, the obligation to reimburse the applicable L/C
            Disbursement shall be permanently converted into an obligation to
            reimburse the Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rates
            calculated as of the date when such payment was due, of such L/C
            Disbursement and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
            the applicable Issuing Bank and each other U.S. Revolving Facility
            Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the Dollar Equivalent
            thereof (if such L/C Disbursement relates to a Foreign Currency
            Letter of Credit), the payment then due from the U.S. Borrower in
            respect thereof and, in the case of a U.S. Revolving Facility
            Lender, such Lender's U.S. Revolving

<PAGE>
                                                                              92

            Facility Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such
            notice, each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender shall pay to the
            Administrative Agent in Dollars its U.S. Revolving Facility
            Percentage of the payment then due from the U.S. Borrower
            (determined as provided in clause (i) of the immediately preceding
            sentence, if such payment relates to a Foreign Currency Letter of
            Credit), in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect
            to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
            mutandis, to the payment obligations of the U.S. Revolving Facility
            Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
            applicable Issuing Bank in Dollars the amounts so received by it
            from the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders. Promptly following receipt
            by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the U.S. Borrower
            pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall
            distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the
            extent that U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders have made payments
            pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to
            such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
            Any payment made by a U.S. Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to
            this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement
            (other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline
            Dollar Borrowing as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan
            and shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower of its obligation to
            reimburse such L/C Disbursement.

                        (f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the U.S.
            Borrower to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e)
            of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable,
            and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this
            Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
            irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
            Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision
            therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter
            of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect
            or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect,
            (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of
            Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does
            not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other
            event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
            the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section,
            constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of
            setoff against, the U.S. Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
            the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor

<PAGE>
                                                                              93

            any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or
            responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or
            transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make
            any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances
            referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
            interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any
            draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter
            of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing
            thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
            consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing
            Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse
            the applicable Issuing Bank from liability to an Applicant Party to
            the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
            damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each
            Applicant Party to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered
            by such Applicant Party that are caused by (i) such Issuing Bank's
            failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
            documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
            thereof or (ii) such Issuing Bank's refusal to issue a Letter of
            Credit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The parties
            hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or
            wilful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank, such
            Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
            determination and each refusal to issue a Letter of Credit. In
            furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality
            thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
            which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
            terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its
            sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
            without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
            notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make
            payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
            compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                        (g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank
            shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
            purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of
            Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative
            Agent, the Applicant Party and the U.S. Borrower (if the U.S.
            Borrower is not the Applicant Party) by telephone (confirmed by
            telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank
            has made or will make a L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that
            any failure to give or delay in giving such

<PAGE>
                                                                              94

            notice shall not relieve the U.S. Borrower of its obligation to
            reimburse such Issuing Bank and the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders
            with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.

                        (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any
            L/C Disbursement, then, unless the U.S. Borrower shall reimburse
            such L/C Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is
            made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day
            from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but
            excluding the date that the U.S. Borrower reimburses such L/C
            Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving
            Loans; provided that, if such L/C Disbursement is not reimbursed by
            the U.S. Borrower when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
            Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply; provided, further, that,
            in the case of a L/C Disbursement made under a Foreign Currency
            Letter of Credit, the amount of interest due with respect thereto
            shall (i) in the case of any L/C Disbursement that is reimbursed on
            or before the date such L/C Disbursement is required to be
            reimbursed under paragraph (e) of this Section, (A) be payable in
            the applicable Foreign Currency and (B) bear interest at a rate
            equal to the rate reasonably determined by the applicable Issuing
            Bank to be the cost to such Issuing Bank of funding such L/C
            Disbursement plus the Applicable Margin applicable to Eurocurrency
            Revolving Loans at such time and (ii) in the case of any L/C
            Disbursement that is reimbursed after the date such L/C Disbursement
            is required to be reimbursed under paragraph (e) of this Section,
            (A) be payable in Dollars, (B) accrue interest on the Dollar
            Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of the
            date such L/C Disbursement was made, of such L/C Disbursement, (C)
            bear interest at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving
            Loans and (D) Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant
            to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing
            Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment
            by any U.S. Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of
            this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account
            of such U.S. Revolving Facility Lender to the extent of such
            payment.

                        (i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may
            be replaced at any time by written agreement among the U.S.
            Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and
            the successor Issuing Bank. The

<PAGE>
                                                                              95

            Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
            replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement
            shall become effective, the U.S. Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees
            accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
            Section 2.12. From and after the effective date of any such
            replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the
            rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this
            Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter
            and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be
            deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank,
            or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context
            shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder,
            the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
            continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank
            under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
            prior to such replacement but shall not be required to issue
            additional Letters of Credit.

                        (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default
            shall occur and be continuing, (i) in the case of an Event of
            Default described in Section 7.01(h) or (i), on the Business Day or
            (ii) in the case of any other Event of Default, on the third
            Business Day, in each case, following the date on which the U.S.
            Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent (or, if the
            maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, U.S. Revolving Facility
            Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of
            the total Revolving L/C Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
            collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the U.S. Borrower shall
            deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of
            the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an
            amount in Dollars in cash equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of
            such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided
            that (i) the portion of such amount attributable to undrawn Foreign
            Currency Letters of Credit or L/C Disbursements in a Foreign
            Currency that the U.S. Borrower is not late in reimbursing pursuant
            to Section 2.05(e) shall be deposited with the Administrative Agent
            in the applicable Foreign Currencies in the actual amounts of such
            undrawn Letters of Credit and L/C Disbursements and (ii) upon the
            occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to a Borrower
            described in clause (h) or (i) of Section 7.01, the obligation to
            deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and
            such deposit shall become immediately due and payable in Dollars,
            without demand or other notice of any kind. The U.S. Borrower also
            shall deposit cash

<PAGE>
                                                                              96

            collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required
            by Section 2.11(b). Each such deposit pursuant to this paragraph or
            pursuant to Section 2.11(b) shall be held by the Administrative
            Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
            obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Agreement. The
            Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
            including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
            Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits,
            which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of
            (i) for so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, the
            Administrative Agent and (ii) at any other time, the U.S. Borrower,
            in each case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense
            of the U.S. Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest.
            Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in
            such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
            Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for L/C
            Disbursements for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed
            and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
            satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the U.S. Borrower
            for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of
            the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of U.S.
            Revolving Facility Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing
            greater than 50% of the total Revolving L/C Exposure), be applied to
            satisfy other obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Agreement.
            If the U.S. Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
            collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
            Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
            be returned to the U.S. Borrower within three Business Days after
            all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the U.S.
            Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
            hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(b), such amount (to the extent
            not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the U.S. Borrower as
            and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the U.S.
            Borrower would remain in compliance with Section 2.11(b) and no
            Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

                        (k) Conversion. In the event that the Loans become
            immediately due and payable on any date pursuant to Section 7.01,
            all amounts (i) that the U.S. Borrower is at such time or thereafter
            become required to reimburse or otherwise pay to the Administrative
            Agent in respect of L/C Disbursements made under any Foreign
            Currency Letter of Credit (other than amounts in respect of which
            the U.S. Borrower has deposited cash collateral pursuant to

<PAGE>
                                                                              97

            Section 2.05(j), if such cash collateral was deposited in the
            applicable Foreign Currency to the extent so deposited or applied),
            (ii) that the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders are at the time or
            thereafter become required to pay to the Administrative Agent and
            the Administrative Agent is at the time or thereafter becomes
            required to distribute to an Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (e)
            of this Section in respect of unreimbursed L/C Disbursements made
            under any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit and (iii) that
            constitute each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender's participation in
            any L/C Disbursement made under a Foreign Currency Letter of Credit,
            in each case, shall, automatically and with no further action
            required, be converted into the Dollar Equivalent, determined using
            the Exchange Rates calculated as of such date (or in the case of any
            L/C Disbursement made after such date, on the date such L/C
            Disbursement is made), of such amounts. On and after such
            conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to an Agent, an Issuing
            Bank or any Lender in respect of the obligations described in this
            paragraph shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rates
            otherwise applicable hereunder.

                        (l) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the
            U.S. Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent designate up
            to four Lenders (in addition to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) that
            agree (in their sole discretion) to act in such capacity and are
            reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as Issuing
            Banks. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart
            of this Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative Agent
            (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall
            thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes.

                        (m) Reporting. Unless otherwise requested by the
            Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to
            the Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each week
            and the first Business Day of each fiscal quarter, the aggregate
            face amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of
            the last Business Day of the preceding week or the preceding fiscal
            quarter, as applicable, (ii) on or prior to each Business Day on
            which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any
            Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or
            extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to
            be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after
            giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
            occurred (and whether the amount thereof

<PAGE>
                                                                              98

            changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank
            makes any L/C Disbursement, the date of such L/C Disbursement and
            the amount of such L/C Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business
            Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall
            reasonably request.

                        (n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
            Agreement, if, after the Closing Date, any Change in Law shall make
            it unlawful for an Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit
            denominated in a Foreign Currency, then by prompt written notice
            thereof to the Borrowers and to the Administrative Agent (which
            notice shall be withdrawn whenever such circumstances no longer
            exist), such Issuing Bank may declare that Letters of Credit will
            not thereafter be issued by it in the affected Foreign Currency or
            Foreign Currencies, whereupon the affected Foreign Currency or
            Foreign Currencies shall be deemed (for the duration of such
            declaration) not to constitute a Foreign Currency for purposes of
            the issuance of Letters of Credit by such Issuing Bank.

                  SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall
      make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by
      wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to
      the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for
      such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall
      be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such
      Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the
      amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the applicable
      Borrower maintained with the Applicable Agent (i) in New York City, in the
      case of Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) in London, in the case of
      Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency and designated by the applicable
      Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving
      Loans and Swingline Dollar Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of
      a L/C Disbursement and reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall
      be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

                        (b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received
            notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing
            that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent
            such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may
            assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date
            in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in
            reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable
            Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not
            in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing

<PAGE>
                                                                              99

            available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and
            the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable
            Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding
            amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the
            date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but
            excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the
            case of such Lender, (x) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
            Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
            with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case
            of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (y) the rate reasonably
            determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding
            such amount (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign
            Currency) or (ii) in the case of the applicable Borrower, the
            interest rate applicable to ABR Loans (in the case of a Borrowing
            denominated in Dollars) or the rate reasonably determined by the
            Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the
            case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency). If such
            Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount
            shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Borrowing initially
      shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in
      the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest
      Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, t he applicable
      Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type, in the
      case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, or to continue such Borrowing
      and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
      therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may
      elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
      Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
      among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the
      Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
      Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Foreign Currency
      Borrowings or Swingline Dollar Borrowings, which may not be converted or
      continued.

                        (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the
            applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such
            election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be
            required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a
            Borrowing of the Type and denominated in the Foreign Currency
            resulting from such election to be made on the effective

<PAGE>
                                                                             100

            date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
            Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
            delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest
            Election Request in a form approved by the Applicable Agent and
            signed by the applicable Borrower.

                        (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election
            Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
            Section 2.02:


                        (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election
                  Request applies and, if different options are being elected
                  with respect to different portions thereof, the portions
                  thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which
                  case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii)
                  and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
                  Borrowing);

                        (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to
                  such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                        (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
                  Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; provided that the
                  resulting Borrowing is required to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing
                  in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency;
                  and

                        (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency
                  Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
                  giving effect to such election, which shall be a period
                  contemplated by clause (a) of the definition of the term
                  "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                        (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
            Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender to which such
            Interest Election Request relates of the details thereof and of such
            Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                        (e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely
            Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing
            prior to the end of the Interest

<PAGE>
                                                                             101

            Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
            provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing
            shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (unless such Borrowing is
            denominated in a Foreign Currency, in which case such Borrowing
            shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest
            Period of one month's duration commencing on the last day of such
            Interest Period). Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
            an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
            Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request
            through electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
            applicable Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is
            continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or
            continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each
            Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to
            an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
            thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing
            denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be continued as a
            Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's
            duration.

                  SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)
      (i) Unless previously terminated, (A) the Existing U.S. Revolving Facility
      Commitments and Existing Global Revolving Facility Commitments shall
      terminate on the earlier of (1) the Effective Funding Date (at the
      Effective Funding Time on such date) and (2) February 28, 2009 and (B) the
      New U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments and New Global Revolving Facility
      Commitments shall terminate (1) on January 12, 2005, if the Effective
      Funding Time does not occur by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on such
      date, or (2) otherwise, on January 10, 2010.

                  (ii) Unless previously terminated, the Tranche A Term Loan
      Commitments and the Tranche B Term Loan Commitments shall terminate at
      5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 12, 2005.

                        (b) The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and all
            Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) may at any time terminate, or from
            time to time reduce, the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that
            (i) each reduction of the Commitments under any Facility shall be in
            an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
            than $5,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Revolving
            Credit Commitments) and (ii) the U.S. Borrower shall not terminate
            or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments if, after giving effect
            to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance
            with Section 2.11, (x) the Global Revolving Facility Credit Exposure
            plus the total Ancillary Facility Commitments

<PAGE>
                                                                             102

            would exceed the total Global Revolving Facility Commitments or (y)
            the U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure would exceed the total
            U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments.

                        (c) The U.S. Borrower shall notify the Administrative
            Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit
            Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three
            Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or
            reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.
            Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
            shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
            notice delivered by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section shall
            be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the
            Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the U.S. Borrower may
            state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of
            other credit facilities (including the New Global Revolving Facility
            and the New U.S. Revolving Facility), in which case such notice may
            be revoked by the U.S. Borrower (by notice to the Administrative
            Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition
            is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments
            shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments under any
            Facility shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
            their respective Commitments under such Facility.

                  SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
      U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable
      Agent for the account of each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender the then
      unpaid principal amount of each Existing U.S. Revolving Facility Loan made
      by such Lender to the U.S. Borrower on the earlier of (A) the Effective
      Funding Date (at the Effective Funding Time on such date) and (B) the
      Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (ii) to the Applicable Agent for the
      account of each Global Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid amount of
      each Existing Global Revolving Facility Loan made by such Lender to the
      U.S. Borrower on the earlier of (A) the Effective Funding Date (at the
      Effective Funding Time on such date) and (B) the Revolving Credit Maturity
      Date, (iii) to the Applicable Agent for the account of each U.S. Revolving
      Facility Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each New U.S.
      Revolving Facility Loan made by such Lender to the U.S. Borrower on the
      Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (iv) to the Applicable Agent for the
      account of each Global Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid principal
      amount of each New Global Revolving Facility Loan made by such Lender to
      the U.S. Borrower on the

<PAGE>
                                                                             103

      Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (v) to the Applicable Agent for the
      account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan
      made by such Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (vi) to the Swingline
      Dollar Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Dollar
      Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the first
      date after such Swingline Dollar Loan is made that is the 15th or last day
      of a calendar month and is at least five Business Days after such
      Swingline Dollar Loan is made; provided that on each date that a U.S.
      Revolving Facility Borrowing is made by the U.S. Borrower (including on
      the Effective Funding Date), the U.S. Borrower shall repay all Swingline
      Dollar Loans then outstanding. Each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereby
      unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Applicable Agent for the
      account of each Existing Global Revolving Facility Lender the then unpaid
      principal amount of each Existing Global Revolving Facility Loan made by
      such Lender to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower on the earlier of (A) the
      Effective Funding Date (at the Effective Funding Time on such date) and
      (B) the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (ii) to the Applicable Agent for

            prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations
            recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or an
            Applicable Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein
            shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to
            repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                        (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be

            Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a
            promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
            requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns)
            and in a form approved by the Applicable Agent. Thereafter, the
            Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall
            at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04)
            be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable
            to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note
            is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

For purposes of determining any allocation made ratably or on a pro rata basis

determined using the Exchange Rate calculated as of the date of such prepayment.
For purposes of determining the amount of any prepayment of Tranche D-2 Term
Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.11(c) or 2.11(d), the applicable Exchange Rate
on the date such prepayment is to be made shall be used.

                  (h) Any Lender holding Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche D-1 Term
      Loans, Tranche D-2 Term Loans or Tranche E Term Loans may elect, on not

      Lender receives its ratable share of such repayment (based upon the
      respective Global Revolving Facility Credit Exposures of the Global
      Revolving Facility Lenders at the time of such repayment) and (y) in all
      other cases, shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid
      Borrowing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately

            SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The applicable Borrower shall
have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 2.16), in
an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing
Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum or, if less, the amount
outstanding, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 2.10(i).

                  (b) In the event and on such occasion that (i) (A) the sum of

      Facility Commitments solely as a result of currency fluctuations or (y)
      the total Global Revolving Facility Commitments (other than as a result of
      currency fluctuations), the Borrowers under the Global Revolving Facility
      shall prepay Global Revolving Facility Borrowings or Swingline Foreign
      Currency Borrowings made to such Borrowers, or reduce total Ancillary
      Commitments, in an aggregate amount equal to the amount by which (A) the
      sum of (1) the Global Revolving Facility Credit Exposure and (2) the total
      Ancillary Commitments exceeds (B) the total Global Revolving Facility
      Commitments or (ii) the U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeds
      (A) 105% of the total U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments solely as a
      result of currency fluctuations or (B) the total U.S. Revolving Facility
      Commitments (other than as a result of currency fluctuations), the U.S.
      Borrower shall prepay U.S. Revolving Facility Borrowings or Swingline
      Dollar Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding,

      deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent
      pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to the amount by
      which the U.S. Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeds the total U.S.
      Revolving Facility Commitments.

                  (c) The U.S. Borrower shall apply all Net Proceeds promptly
      upon receipt thereof to prepay Term Borrowings in accordance with
      paragraphs (g) through (i) of Section 2.10.

                  (d) Not later than 90 days after the end of each Excess Cash
      Flow Period, the U.S. Borrower shall calculate Excess Cash Flow for such
      Excess Cash Flow Period and shall apply an amount equal to the Required
      Percentage of such Excess Cash Flow to prepay Term Borrowings in
      accordance with paragraphs (g) through (i) of Section 2.10. Not later than
      the date on which the U.S. Borrower is required to deliver financial
      statements with respect to the end of each Excess Cash Flow Period under
      Section 5.04(a), the U.S. Borrower will deliver to the Administrative
      Agent a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the U.S. Borrower
      setting forth the amount, if any, of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year
      and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail.

                  (e) All voluntary prepayments of (i) Tranche D Term Loans
      effected on or prior to the first anniversary of the Second Restatement
      Effective Date or (ii) Tranche B Term Loans effected on or prior to the
      first anniversary of the Effective Funding Date with the proceeds of a
      substantially concurrent issuance or incurrence of new term loans under
      this Agreement, as amended, amended and restated, supplemented, waived or
      otherwise modified from time to time (excluding a refinancing of all the
      Facilities outstanding under this Agreement in connection with another
      transaction not permitted by this Agreement (as determined prior to giving
      effect to any amendment or waiver of this Agreement being adopted in
      connection with such transaction)), shall be accompanied by a prepayment
      fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate amount of such prepayments if the
      Applicable Margin (or similar interest rate spread) applicable to such new
      term loans is or, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, could be
      less than the Applicable Margin applicable to the Tranche D Term Loans or
      Tranche B Term Loans, as applicable, as of the date hereof.

            SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and
the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers) agrees to

pay to each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the
Administrative Agent, 10 Business Days after the last day of March, June,
September and December in each year, and three Business Days after the date on
which the Revolving Credit Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as
provided herein, a commitment fee (a "Commitment Fee") on the sum of (i) the
daily unused amount of the U.S. Revolving Facility Commitment, (ii) the daily
amount of the Available Unused Commitment and (iii) the daily unused amount of
the Ancillary Commitment of such Lender during the preceding quarter (or other
period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the date on which the
last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be terminated) at a rate equal to
(A) prior to the Effective Funding Time, (x) 0.75% per annum in respect of each
day on which the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure (excluding the Swingline
Exposures) is less than or equal to 50% of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment
or the Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1.00, (y) 0.50% per annum in
respect of each day on which the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure (excluding
the Swingline Exposures) represents more than 50% of the Total Revolving Credit
Commitment or the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00 but
greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and (z) 0.375%, if the Leverage Ratio is less than or
equal to 2.00 to 1.00 (without regard to the Aggregate Revolving Credit
Exposure) and (B) at or after the Effective Funding Time, at the rates set forth
under the caption "Commitment Fee Rate" in the definition of "Applicable
Margin". All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. For the purpose of calculating any
Lender's Commitment Fee, the outstanding Swingline Loans during the period for
which such Lender's Commitment Fee is calculated shall be deemed to be zero. The
Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date
and shall cease to accrue on the date on which the last of the Commitments of
such Lender shall be terminated as provided herein, provided that (1) no
Commitment Fees shall be payable to Lenders in respect of the New Global
Revolving Facility Commitments or the New U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments
for any period prior to the Effective Funding Time, (2) all Commitment Fees
accruing through and including the Effective Funding Date shall be payable on
the Effective Funding Date and (3) all Commitment Fees accruing after the
Effective Funding Date shall be payable in the manner described above.

                  (b) The U.S. Borrower (on behalf of itself and the Foreign
      Subsidiary Borrowers) from time to time agrees to pay (i) to each U.S.
      Revolving Facility Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the
      Administrative Agent, 10 Business Days after the last day of March, June,
      September and December of each year and three Business Days

      Participation Fee") on such Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of
      the daily aggregate Revolving L/C Exposure (excluding the portion thereof
      attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements), during the preceding
      quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with
      the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the date on which the U.S. Revolving
      Facility Commitments shall be terminated) at the rate per annum equal to
      the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings effective for
      each day in such period minus the amount of Issuing Bank Fees (as defined
      below) set forth in clause (ii)(x) below and (ii) to each Issuing Bank,
      for its own account, (x) three Business Days after the last day of March,
      June, September and December of each year and three Business Days after
      the date on which the U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments of all the
      Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a fronting fee in respect
      of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from
      and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and
      including the termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate
      equal to 1/4 of 1% per annum of the daily average stated amount of such
      Letter of Credit), plus (y) in connection with the issuance, amendment or
      transfer of any such Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement thereunder,
      such Issuing Bank's customary documentary and processing charges
      (collectively, "Issuing Bank Fees"). For the purposes of the foregoing,
      (i) all L/C Participation Fees accruing through and including the
      Effective Funding Date shall be payable on the Effective Funding Date to
      the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders that have Existing U.S. Revolving
      Facility Commitments in the manner described above (and shall be
      calculated by reference to the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Existing
      Revolving Borrowings) and (ii) all L/C Participation Fees accruing after
      the Effective Funding Date shall be payable to the U.S. Revolving Facility
      Lenders that have New U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments in the manner
      described above (and shall be calculated by reference to the Applicable
      Margin for Eurocurrency New Revolving Borrowings). All L/C Participation
      Fees and Issuing Bank Fees that are payable on a per annum basis shall be
      computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of
      360 days.

                  (c) The U.S. Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
      Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the fees set forth in
      the Administrative Agent Fee

      Letter dated as of November 16, 2004, as amended, restated, supplemented
      or otherwise modified from time to time, at the times specified therein
      (the "Administrative Agent Fees").

                  (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
      available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as
      appropriate, among the Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees shall be
      paid directly to the applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees
      shall be refundable under any circumstances.

            SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
(including each Swingline Dollar Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall
      bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect
      for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

                  (c) The Swingline Foreign Currency Loans comprising each
      Swingline Foreign Currency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Swingline
      Foreign Currency Rate plus 1.50% per annum plus the Applicable Margin then
      in effect for Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or
      interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the applicable
      Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon
      acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after
      as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case
      of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to
      such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii)
      in the case of any other amount (x) payable in Dollars, 2% plus the rate
      applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section or
      (y) payable in a Foreign Currency, the rate set forth in clause (i) of
      this sentence; provided that this paragraph (d) shall not apply to any
      Event of Default that has been waived by the Lenders pursuant to Section
      9.08.

                  (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
      (i) on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of

      Existing U.S. Revolving Facility Loans, upon termination of the Existing
      U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments, (iv) in the case of New Global
      Revolving Facility Loans, upon termination of the New Global Revolving
      Facility Commitments, (v) in the case of New U.S. Revolving Facility
      Loans, upon termination of the New U.S. Revolving Facility Commitments,
      (vi) in the case of the Tranche A Term Loans, on the Tranche A Maturity
      Date, (vii) in the case of the Tranche A-1 Term Loans, on the earlier of
      the Effective Funding Date (at the Effective Funding Time on such date)
      and the Tranche A-1 Maturity Date, (viii) in the case of the Tranche B
      Term Loans, and on the Tranche B Maturity Date, (ix) in the case of the
      Tranche D Term Loans, on the earlier date the Effective Funding Date (at
      the Effective Funding Time on such date) and the Tranche D Maturity Date
      and (x) in the case of the Tranche E Term Loans, on the Tranche E Maturity
      Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
      Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
      prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan
      prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the
      principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
      repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
      Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period
      therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
      date of such conversion.

                  (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
      year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on Borrowings denominated in
      Sterling and (ii) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
      Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate
      shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a
      leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of
      days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The
      applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be
      determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination shall be
      conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in
any currency:

            (a) the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be
      conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
      not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
      applicable, for such Interest Period; or

<PAGE>

                                                                             116

            (b) the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders or the
      Majority Lenders under the Global Revolving Facility that the Adjusted
      LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will
      not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
      maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest
      Period;

then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Applicable Agent notifies the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such
currency shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or
continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if
such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, an ABR Borrowing or (B) if such
Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, as a Borrowing bearing interest
at such rate as the Majority Lenders under the Global Revolving Facility and the
applicable Borrower shall agree adequately reflects the costs to the Global
Revolving Facility Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans, and (ii) if any
Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (if such Borrowing is requested to
be made in Dollars) or shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at such
rate as the Majority Lenders under the Global Revolving Facility shall agree
adequately reflects the costs to the Global Revolving Facility Lenders of making
the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
            deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
            for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any
            such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or
            those for which payment has been requested pursuant to Section 2.21)
            or Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London
            interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement,
            Eurocurrency Loans or Swingline Foreign Currency Loans made by such
            Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein (except
            those for which payment has been requested pursuant to Section
            2.21);

<PAGE>

                                                                             117

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or Swingline Foreign
Currency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to
increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower (in the case of a Loan) or
the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of Credit) will pay to such Lender or
Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change
      in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
      reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or
      on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any,
      as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations
      in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued
      by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such
      Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could
      have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
      Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's
      or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy),
      then from time to time the applicable Borrower (in the case of a Loan) or
      the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of Credit) shall pay to such
      Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or
      amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such
      Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction
      suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth
      the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank
      or its holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or
      (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower (in the
      case of a Loan) or the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of Credit)
      and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower (in
      the case of a Loan) or the U.S. Borrower (in the case of a Letter of
      Credit) shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount
      shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                                                                             118

                  (d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has
      determined that it will make a request for increased compensation pursuant
      to this Section 2.15, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall notify the
      applicable Borrower thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or
      Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
      constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand
      such compensation; provided that a Borrower shall not be required to
      compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any
      increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the
      date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, notifies such
      Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
      reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim
      compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law
      giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
      180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period
      of retroactive effect thereof.

            SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Swingline Foreign Currency
Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto
(including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any
Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency
Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the
assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by a Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, such Borrower shall compensate each
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of
a Eurocurrency Loan or Swingline Foreign Currency Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender
to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued
on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue a
Eurocurrency Loan, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the
applicable Foreign Currency of a comparable amount and period

<PAGE>

                                                                             119

from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting
forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section shall be delivered to such Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

            SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of any Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if a
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) any Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank,
as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to
      the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Agents, each Lender and
      each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the
      full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent,
      Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, on or with respect to any payment
      by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including
      Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
      amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and
      reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
      not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
      imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate
      as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Borrower
      by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own
      behalf, on behalf of another Agent or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing
      Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
      Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such
      Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
      certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
      evidencing

<PAGE>

                                                                             120

      such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
      evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
      Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
      or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
      a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
      party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such
      Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
      prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
      documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such
      Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at
      a reduced rate.

                  (f) If an Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
      discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as
      to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which
      such Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17,
      it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of
      indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower
      under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving
      rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such
      Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by
      the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided
      that such Borrower, upon the request of such Agent or such Lender, agrees
      to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties,
      interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority)
      to such Agent or such Lender in the event such Agent or such Lender is
      required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section
      shall not be construed to require any Agent or any Lender to make
      available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
      which it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other person.

            SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) Unless otherwise specified, each Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16, 2.17 or 2.21, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Applicable Agent, be
<PAGE>

                                                                             121

deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable
Agent to the applicable account designated to the U.S. Borrower by each
Applicable Agent, except payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing
Bank or the applicable Lender as expressly provided herein and except
that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.21 and 9.05 shall be made
directly to the persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute
any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
such extension. All payments hereunder of (i) principal or interest in respect
of any Loan shall be made in the currency in which such Loan is denominated,
(ii) reimbursement obligations shall, subject to Sections 2.05(e) and 2.05(k),
be made in the currency in which the Letter of Credit in respect of which such
reimbursement obligation exists is denominated or (iii) any other amount due
hereunder or under another Loan Document (other than an Ancillary Facility
Document) shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by an
Applicable Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time
required if such Applicable Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the
necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or
operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such
Applicable Agent to make such payment. Any amount payable by any Applicable
Agent to one or more Lenders in the national currency of a member state of the
European Union that has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency shall be paid in
Euros.

            (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
      to the Applicable Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of
      principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due from
      such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards
      payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder,
      ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts
      of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
      payment of principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due from such
      Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
      accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed L/C
      Disbursements then due to such parties.

                                                                             122

            (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
      counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of
      or interest on any of its Term Loans, Revolving Loans or participations in
      L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
      payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans,
      Revolving Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline
      Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any
      other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
      purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans,
      Revolving Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline
      Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all
      such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with
      the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
      respective Term Loans, Revolving Loans and participations in L/C
      Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such
      participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
      rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
      purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest,
      and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to
      apply to any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with
      the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as
      consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of
      its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements to any assignee or
      participant, other than to such Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
      thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply).
      Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
      effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
      participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
      such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
      participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such
      Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            (d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a
      Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Applicable
      Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank
      hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable
      Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in
      accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute
      to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount

<PAGE>

                                                                             123

      due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment,
      then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable,
      severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the
      amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest
      thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
      distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
      Administrative Agent, at (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective
      Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
      banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount
      denominated in Dollars) and (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the
      Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case
      of an amount denominated in a Foreign Currency).

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
      be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or
      2.18(d), then the Applicable Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
      any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by
      the Applicable Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
      Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied
      obligations are fully paid.

            SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.21, or if a Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.21, as
applicable, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender in any material respect. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or
      2.21, or if a Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
      Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
      pursuant to Section 2.17, or is a Defaulting Lender, then such Borrower
      may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
      Administrative Agent, require such Lender to

                                                                             124

      assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to
      the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
      obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
      obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
      such assignment); provided that (i) such Borrower shall have received the
      prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
      unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of
      an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
      participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest
      thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from
      the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
      interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and
      (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
      compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.21 or payments required to be made
      pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in
      such compensation or payments. Nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be
      deemed to prejudice any rights that any Borrower may have against any
      Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.

                  (c) In connection with any proposed waiver, amendment or
      modification of this Agreement or any Loan Document pursuant to Section
      9.08(b) (a "Proposed Change") requiring the consent of all affected
      Lenders, if the consent of the Required Lenders (and, to the extent any
      Proposed Change requires the consent of Lenders holding Loans of any
      Facility pursuant to clause (vii) or (viii) of Section 9.08(b), the
      consent of the Majority Lenders participating in such Facility) to such
      Proposed Change is obtained, but the consent to such Proposed Change of
      other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender
      whose consent is not obtained as described in this Section 2.19(c) being
      referred to as a "Non-Consenting Lender"), then the U.S. Borrower may, at
      its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Non-Consenting Lender and
      the Administrative Agent, require such Non-Consenting Lender to assign and
      delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
      restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
      obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
      obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
      such assignment); provided that (i) the U.S. Borrower shall have received
      the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall
      not unreasonably be withheld, and (ii) such Non-Consenting

                                                                             125

      Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
      principal of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and
      Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
      amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such
      outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the U.S. Borrower
      (in the case of all other amounts, including amounts under Sections 2.15,
      2.16 and 2.17).

            SECTION 2.20. Foreign Subsidiary Loan Parties. On or after the
Closing Date, the U.S. Borrower may designate any Foreign Subsidiary that is a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement executed by such
Foreign Subsidiary and the U.S. Borrower. Each such designation shall specify
whether such Foreign Subsidiary shall be entitled (i) to make Borrowings under
the Global Revolving Facility and request Letters of Credit under the U.S.
Revolving Facility and/or (ii) to request the creation of Ancillary Facilities
under Section 2.22, and each such designation shall be subject to the consent of
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).
Upon the execution by the U.S. Borrower and delivery to the Administrative Agent
of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Termination with respect to any Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower, such Foreign Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement; provided that no Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower Termination will become effective as to any Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower (other than to terminate such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower's
right to make further Borrowings under this Agreement) at a time when any
principal of or interest on any Loan to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or any
Foreign Currency Letter of Credit for the account of such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder or any Ancillary Facility under which
Ancillary Credit Extensions may be made available to such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower has not been previously terminated. Promptly following receipt of any
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Agreement or Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
Termination, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each
Revolving Credit Lender. The U.S. Borrower shall be entitled to designate any
Foreign Subsidiary that complies with the requirements described in Section
5.10(f) as a Foreign Subsidiary Loan Party.

            SECTION 2.21. Additional Reserve Costs. (a) For so long as any
Lender is required to make special deposits with the Bank of England or comply
with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of the Bank of
England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees, in each case in
respect of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans or Swingline Foreign Currency

<PAGE>

                                                                             126

Loans, such Lender shall be entitled to require the applicable Borrower to pay,
contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans,
additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory
Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth
in Exhibit L hereto.

                  (b) For so long as any Lender is required to comply with
      reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any
      monetary or other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the
      European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but
      excluding requirements reflected in the Statutory Reserves or the
      Mandatory Costs Rate) in respect of any of such Lender's Eurocurrency
      Loans Swingline Foreign Currency Loans, such Lender shall be entitled to
      require the applicable Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each
      payment of interest on each of such Lender's Loans subject to such
      requirements, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum
      specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with
      such requirements in relation to such Loan.

                  (c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or
      (b) above shall be determined by the applicable Lender, which
      determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to
      the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least
      five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the
      applicable Loan, and such additional interest so notified to the
      applicable Borrower by such Lender shall be payable to the Administrative
      Agent for the account of such Lender on each date on which interest is
      payable for such Loan.

            SECTION 2.22. Ancillary Facilities. (a) General. If a Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower and a Global Revolving Facility Lender agree, subject to (i)
compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 2.22 and (ii) such
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower having complied with Sections 2.20 and 4.03, such
Global Revolving Facility Lender shall be permitted to provide an Ancillary
Facility on a bilateral basis to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. The total
Ancillary Commitments shall not at any time exceed the Ancillary Commitment
Limit. During the period from and including the Closing Date to and including
the Effective Funding Date (at the Effective Funding Time on such date),
Ancillary Facilities may be provided solely by Global Revolving Facility Lenders

      such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower; (iii) provide that the Ancillary
      Commitment of the applicable Ancillary Lender under such Ancillary
      Facility shall not exceed such Ancillary Lender's Available Unused

            Revolving Facility Lender and (ii) at any other time, the applicable
            Eligible Borrower, in each case, in Permitted Investments and at the
            risk and expense of such Eligible Borrower, such deposits shall not
            bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments
            shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be
            applied by the applicable Global Revolving Facility Lender to offset
            amounts payable in respect of Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extensions
            made under such terminated Ancillary Facility. In the event that
            after the Ancillary Facility Termination Date for an Ancillary
            Facility but prior to the CAM Exchange Date, an Unfunded Ancillary
            Credit Extension made under such terminated Ancillary Facility shall
            expire without requiring payment, the portion of the cash collateral
            deposited hereunder with respect to such expired Unfunded Ancillary
            Credit Extension shall be distributed to the applicable Eligible
            Borrower.

                        (f) Cancelation by Foreign Subsidiary Borrower. The
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to which an Ancillary Facility has been made
available shall be permitted at any time to request the cancelation of all or a
portion of such Ancillary Facility by delivery of a notice in writing to the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Ancillary Lender, specifying the
Ancillary Facility to be canceled and the proposed cancelation date. Such notice
shall be delivered not less than five Business Days prior to the proposed
cancelation date. Such cancelation shall be effective as of the proposed
cancelation date unless the Ancillary Facility Exposure under such Ancillary
Facility has not been reduced to zero as of such date.

                                                                             132

                        (g) Additional Information. Each Ancillary Lender shall
                  report in writing to the Administrative Agent on the first
                  Business Day of each fiscal quarter (i) the Ancillary Facility
                  Exposure for each day during the preceding fiscal quarter for
                  each Ancillary Facility under which it is an Ancillary Lender
                  and (ii) the portion (expressed in Dollars) of its Ancillary
                  Commitment that was unused on each day during the preceding
                  fiscal quarter for each Ancillary Facility under which it is
                  an Ancillary Lender. In addition, each Foreign Subsidiary
                  Borrower to which an Ancillary Facility has been made
                  available and each Ancillary Lender shall, upon request by the
                  Administrative Agent, promptly supply the Administrative Agent
                  with any information relating to the operation of such
                  Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary Facility Exposure)
                  as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

                        (h) Conflict with Loan Documents. In the event of any
                  conflict between the terms of an Ancillary Facility Document
                  and any other Loan Document (other than an Ancillary Facility
                  Document), the terms of such other Loan Document shall govern.

                        (i) Termination and Expiration of Ancillary Commitments.
                  On each date on which an Ancillary Facility expires, is
                  terminated or is canceled (in whole or in part), the Available
                  Unused Commitment of the Ancillary Lender under such Ancillary
                  Facility shall be increased by an amount equal to the portion
                  of such Ancillary Facility that has expired or been canceled,
                  unless the Global Revolving Facility Commitments shall have
                  been previously terminated.

                        (j) Effect of Restatement Transactions on Ancillary
                  Facilities. With respect to each Ancillary Facility that is
                  outstanding at the Effective Funding Time:

                        (i) to the extent such Ancillary Facility was provided
                     by a Global Revolving Facility Lender that will have a New
                     Global Revolving Facility Commitment, such Ancillary
                     Facility shall remain outstanding after the Effective
                     Funding Time as an Ancillary Facility under this Agreement;
                     provided that if, at the Effective Funding Time, the
                     Ancillary Commitment of such Lender with respect to such
                     Ancillary Facility exceeds the New Available Unused
                     Commitment of such Lender, such Ancillary Facility shall be
                     automatically reduced by the amount of such excess (with
                     any

<PAGE>

                                                                             133

            required repayment of Ancillary Credit Extensions as a result of
            such reduction being financed with the proceeds of an Ancillary
            Replacement Borrowing under the New Global Revolving Credit Facility
            at the Effective Funding Time); and

                  (ii) to the extent such Ancillary Facility was provided by a
            Global Revolving Facility Lender that will not have a New Global
            Revolving Facility Commitment, such Ancillary Facility shall be
            automatically terminated (with any required repayment of Ancillary
            Credit Extensions as a result of such termination being financed
            with the proceeds of a new Ancillary Facility provided by a New
            Global Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to this Section 2.22 or
            the proceeds of an Ancillary Replacement Borrowing under the New
            Global Revolving Credit Facility at the Effective Funding Time).

                  (k) Increase in Ancillary Commitments at Effective Funding
      Time. With respect to any Ancillary Facility outstanding at the Effective
      Funding Time that will remain outstanding after the Effective Funding Time
      pursuant to clause (j)(i) above, the applicable New Global Revolving
      Facility Lender and Foreign Subsidiary Borrower may elect to increase the
      Ancillary Commitment with respect to such Ancillary Facility; provided
      that, after giving effect thereto, (i) the total Ancillary Commitments do
      not exceed the Ancillary Commitment Limit and (ii) the Ancillary
      Commitment of such New Global Revolving Facility Lender does not exceed
      the New Available Unused Commitment of such New Global Revolving Facility
      Lender. Any increase in the Ancillary Commitment with respect to any
      Ancillary Facility shall be considered an amendment of such Ancillary
      Facility subject to the terms of paragraph (c) above.

            SECTION 2.23. Incremental Extensions of Credit. At any time after
January 10, 2005, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the U.S.
Borrower may from time to time, by notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon
the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of such notice to each of
the Lenders), request to add additional term loans (the "Incremental Extensions
of Credit") in minimum principal amounts of $50,000,000; provided that
immediately prior to and after giving effect to any Incremental Facility
Amendment (as defined below), (a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing or shall result therefrom and (b) on a Pro Forma Basis, as of
the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the U.S. Borrower for
which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.04, the
U.S. Borrower and

<PAGE>

                                                                             134

the Subsidiaries shall be in compliance with the covenants contained in Section
6.11 and 6.12. The Incremental Extensions of Credit (a) shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not exceeding $300,000,000, (b) shall rank pari passu or junior
in right of payment and right of security in respect of the Collateral with the
Tranche B Term Loans and (c) other than amortization, pricing and maturity date,
shall have terms substantially similar to those with respect to the Tranche B
Term Loans as in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of the applicable
Incremental Facility Amendment; provided that (i) if the Applicable Margin
(which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to include all upfront or
similar fees or original issue discount payable to all Lenders providing such
Incremental Extensions of Credit) relating to the Incremental Extensions of
Credit exceeds the Applicable Margin (which, for such purposes only, shall be
deemed to include all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount payable
to all Tranche B Lenders) relating to the Tranche B Term Loans by more than
0.25%, the Applicable Margin relating to the Tranche B Term Loans shall be
adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Margin (which, for such purposes only,
shall be deemed to include all upfront or similar fees or original issue
discount payable to all Lenders providing such Incremental Extensions of Credit)
relating to the applicable Incremental Extensions of Credit minus 0.25%, (ii)
the Incremental Extensions of Credit shall not have a final maturity date
earlier than the Tranche B Maturity Date and (iii) the Incremental Extensions of
Credit shall not have a weighted average life that is shorter than that of the
then-remaining weighted average life of the Tranche B Term Loans. Any Person
that elects to extend Incremental Extensions of Credit shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (any such Person
being called an "Additional Lender") and shall become a Lender under this
Agreement, pursuant to an amendment (an "Incremental Facility Amendment") to
this Agreement, giving effect to the modifications permitted by this Section
2.23, and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the U.S.
Borrower, each Additional Lender and the Administrative Agent. Commitments in
respect of Incremental Extensions of Credit shall be Commitments under this
Agreement. An Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any
other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.23. The
effectiveness of any Incremental Facility Amendment shall be subject to the
satisfaction on the date thereof (each, an "Incremental Facility Closing Date")
of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (it being understood that
all references to "the date of such Borrowing" in such Section 4.02 shall be
deemed to refer to the Incremental Facility

Closing Date"). The proceeds of the Incremental Extensions of Credit shall be
used for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries.

Auditing Standards No. 100. Such financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations of Holdings
and subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods. None of Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries has or shall
have as of the Restatement Effective Date any Guarantee, contingent liability or
liability for Taxes, or any long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term

good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, or easements or
other limited property interests in, all its properties and assets (including
all Mortgaged Properties), except for minor defects in title that do not
interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to
utilize such properties and assets for their intended purposes and except where
the failure to have such title could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All such properties
and assets are free and clear of Liens, other than Liens expressly permitted by
Section 6.02 or arising by operation of law.

      Material Adverse Effect, and all such leases are in full force and effect,
      except leases in respect of which the failure to be in full force and
      effect could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such
      leases, other than leases in respect of

      reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
      Material Adverse Effect.

      with respect thereto necessary for the present conduct of its business,
      without any known conflict with the rights of others, and free from any
      burdensome restrictions, except where such conflicts and restrictions
      could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
      aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) As of the Restatement Effective Date, none of Holdings,
      Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries has received
      any notice of any pending or contemplated condemnation proceeding

      agreement affecting any Mortgaged Property, or is in default with respect
      to any judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority,

            SECTION 3.14. No Material Misstatements. (a) All written information

transactions contemplated hereby included in the Lenders' Presentation or
otherwise prepared by or on behalf of the foregoing or their representatives and
made available to any Lenders or the Administrative Agent in connection with the
Restatement Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby, when
taken as a whole, were true and correct in all material respects as of the date
thereof, as of the date such Information was first furnished to the Lenders and
as of the Restatement Effective Date and did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact as of any such date or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in
light of the circumstances under which such statements were made.

                  (b) The Projections and estimates prepared by or on behalf of
      the U.S. Borrower or any of its representatives and that have been made
      available to any Lenders or the Administrative Agent in connection with
      the Restatement Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby
      (i) have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed by
      the U.S. Borrower to be reasonable as of the date thereof, as of the date
      such Projections and estimates were first furnished to the Lenders and as
      of the Restatement Effective Date, and (ii) as of the Restatement
      Effective Date, have not been modified in any material respect by the U.S.
      Borrower.

Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates is in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the provisions of the
Code relating to Plans and the regulations and published interpretations

                                                                             142

Intermediate Holdings, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate was required to
file a report with the PBGC, other than reports that have been filed and reports
the failure of which to file could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the Restatement Effective Date, the excess of the present
value of all benefit liabilities under each Plan of the Borrowers, Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates (based on those
assumptions used to fund such Plan), as of the last annual valuation date
applicable thereto for which a valuation is available, over the value of the
assets of such Plan could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and the excess of the present value of all benefit liabilities of all
underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund each such Plan) as of
the last annual valuation dates applicable thereto for which valuations are
available, over the value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Borrowers,
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates has
incurred or could reasonably be expected to incur any Withdrawal Liability that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Borrowers, Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA
Affiliates has received any written notification that any Multiemployer Plan is
in reorganization or has been terminated within the meaning of Title IV of
ERISA, or has knowledge that any Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be
in reorganization or to be terminated, where such reorganization or termination
has had or could reasonably be expected to have, through increases in the
contributions required to be made to such Plan or otherwise, a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (b) Each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
      and the Subsidiaries is in compliance (i) with all applicable provisions
      of law and all applicable regulations and published interpretations
      thereunder with respect to any employee pension benefit plan or other
      employee benefit plan governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than
      the United States and (ii) with the terms of any such plan, except, in
      each case, for such noncompliance that could not reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.16. Environmental Matters. Except for the matters that
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
(i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) is subject to, or

                                                                             143

responsible for, any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any
claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any Environmental
Liability.

            SECTION 3.17. Security Documents. (a) The U.S. Collateral Agreement
is effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the
Secured Parties) a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the
Collateral described therein and proceeds thereof. In the case of the Pledged
Collateral described in the U.S. Collateral Agreement, when certificates or
promissory notes, as applicable, representing such Pledged Collateral are
delivered to the Collateral Agent, and in the case of the other Collateral
described in the U.S. Collateral Agreement (other than the Intellectual Property
(as defined in the U.S. Collateral Agreement)), when financing statements and
other filings specified on Schedule 3 of the U.S. Perfection Certificate in
appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 5 of the U.S.
Perfection Certificate, the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured
Parties) shall have a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all
right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in such Collateral and, subject to
Section 9-315 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof, as
security for the Obligations to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, in each case prior and superior in
right to any other person (except, in the case of Collateral other than Pledged
Collateral, Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02(a) and Liens having
priority by operation of law).

                  (b) When the U.S. Collateral Agreement or a summary thereof is
      properly filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the
      United States Copyright Office, and, with respect to Collateral in which a
      security interest cannot be perfected by such filings, upon the proper
      filing of the financing statements referred to in paragraph (a) above, the
      Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a
      fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and
      interest of the Loan Parties thereunder in the Intellectual Property, in
      each case prior and superior in right to any other Person (it being
      understood that subsequent recordings in the United States Patent and
      Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office may be necessary
      to perfect a lien on registered trademarks and patents, trademark and
      patent applications and registered copyrights acquired by the grantors
      after the Restatement Effective Date).

                                                                             144

                  (c) Each Foreign Pledge Agreement and each Foreign Security
      Agreement is effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the
      benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security
      interest in the Collateral described therein and proceeds thereof. In the
      case of the Pledged Collateral described in a Foreign Pledge Agreement,
      when certificates or promissory notes, as applicable, representing such
      Pledged Collateral are delivered to the Collateral Agent, and, in the case
      of the Collateral described in a Foreign Security Agreement, when filings
      are made in the appropriate offices in each relevant jurisdiction and the
      other actions, if any, specified on such Schedule are taken, the
      Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a
      fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and
      interest of the Loan Parties in such Collateral and the proceeds thereof,
      as security for the Obligations described therein, in each case prior and
      superior in right to any other person (except, in the case of Collateral
      other than Pledged Collateral, Liens expressly permitted by Section
      6.02(a) and Liens having priority by operation of law).

                  (d) The Mortgages entered into after the Restatement Effective
      Date pursuant to Section 5.10 shall be effective to create in favor of the
      Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) a legal, valid
      and enforceable Lien on all of the Loan Parties' right, title and interest
      in and to the Mortgaged Property thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and
      when such Mortgages are filed or recorded in the proper real estate filing
      or recording offices, the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured
      Parties) shall have a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
      all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged
      Property and, to the extent applicable, subject to Section 9-315 of the
      Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof, in each case prior and
      superior in right to any other Person, other than with respect to the
      rights of a Person pursuant to Liens expressly permitted by Section
      6.02(a) and Liens having priority by operation of law.

            SECTION 3.18. Location of Real Property and Leased Premises. (a)
Schedule 2B to the U.S. Perfection Certificate and each Foreign Perfection
Certificate lists completely and correctly as of the Restatement Effective Date
all material real property owned by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties and the addresses thereof. As of the
Restatement Effective Date, Holdings,
<PAGE>

                                                                             145

Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries own in fee all the
real property set forth as being owned by them on such Schedules.

                  (b) Schedule 2B to the U.S. Perfection Certificate lists
      completely and correctly as of the Restatement Effective Date all material
      real property leased by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
      and the Domestic Subsidiary Loan Parties and the addresses thereof. As of
      the Restatement Effective Date, Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S.
      Borrower and the Domestic Subsidiary Loan Parties have valid leases in all
      the real property set forth as being leased by them on such Schedules.

            SECTION 3.19. Solvency. (a) Immediately after giving effect to the
Restatement Transactions (i) the fair value of the assets of each Borrower
(individually) and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of each Borrower (individually) and the
U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, respectively; (ii)
the present fair saleable value of the property of each Borrower (individually)
and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be
greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of
each Borrower (individually) and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, respectively, on their debts and other liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (iii) each Borrower (individually) and the U.S.
Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay their
debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) each Borrower
(individually) and the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the
businesses in which they are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and
are proposed to be conducted following the Restatement Effective Date.

                  (b) None of Holdings or the Borrowers intend to, and does not
      believe that it or any of its subsidiaries will, incur debts beyond its
      ability to pay such debts as they mature, taking into account the timing
      and amounts of cash to be received by it or any such subsidiary and the
      timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its
      Indebtedness or the Indebtedness of any such subsidiary

                                                                             146

            SECTION 3.20. Labor Matters. There are no strikes pending or
threatened against Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of
the Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The hours worked and payments made
to employees of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the
Subsidiaries have not been in violation in any material respect of the Fair
Labor Standards Act or any other applicable law dealing with such matters. All
material payments due from Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or
any of the Subsidiaries or for which any claim may be made against Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, on account
of wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary to the extent required by GAAP. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.20, consummation of the Transactions will not give rise
to a right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union
under any collective bargaining agreement to which Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (or any predecessor) is a
party or by which Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of
the Subsidiaries (or any predecessor) is bound, other than collective bargaining
agreements that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            SECTION 3.21. Insurance. Schedule 3.21 sets forth a true, complete
and correct description of all material insurance maintained by or on behalf of
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the Subsidiaries as of the
Restatement Effective Date. As of such date, such insurance is in full force and
effect. The U.S. Borrower believes that the insurance maintained by or on behalf
of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries is
adequate.

      with respect to the Mortgaged Properties to be endorsed or otherwise
      amended to include a "standard" or "New York" lender's loss payable

      "Replacement Cost Endorsement", without any deduction for depreciation,
      and such other provisions as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
      Agent may reasonably (in light of a Default or a material development in

      policy previously delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
      Agent), or insurance certificate with respect thereto, together with
      evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent

                  (c) If at any time the area in which the Premises (as defined
      in the Mortgages) are located is designated a "flood hazard area" in any
      Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Federal Emergency Management

      damage) and umbrella liability insurance against any and all claims, in
      each case in amounts and against such risks as are customarily maintained
      by companies engaged in the same or similar industry operating in the same
      or similar locations naming the Collateral Agent as an additional insured,
      on forms reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

                  (e) Notify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent

      an insurance certificate with respect thereto.

                  (f) In connection with the covenants set forth in this Section
      5.02, it is understood and agreed that:

                  (i) none of the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and
            their respective agents or employees shall be liable for any loss or
            damage insured by the insurance policies required to be maintained
            under this Section 5.02, it being understood that (A) the U.S.
            Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall look solely to their
            insurance companies or any other parties other than the aforesaid
            parties for the recovery of such loss or damage and (B) such
            insurance companies shall have no rights of subrogation against the
            Agents, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank or their agents or employees.
            If, however, the insurance policies do not provide waiver of
            subrogation rights against such parties, as required above, then
            each of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and the U.S. Borrower hereby
            agree, to the extent permitted by law, to waive, and to cause each
            of the Subsidiaries to waive, its right of recovery, if any, against
            the Agents, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank and their agents and
            employees; and

                  (ii) the designation of any form, type or amount of insurance
            coverage by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under
            this Section 5.02 shall in no event be deemed a representation,
            warranty or advice by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
            or the Lenders that such insurance is adequate for the purposes of
            the business of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
            and the Subsidiaries or the protection of their properties.

            SECTION 5.03. Taxes. Pay and discharge promptly when due all
material Taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it
or upon its income or profits or in respect of its property, before the same
shall become delinquent or in default, as well as all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies or otherwise that, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien
upon such properties or any part thereof; provided, however, that such payment
and discharge shall not be required with respect to any such Tax, assessment,
charge, levy or claim so long as the validity or amount thereof shall be
contested in good

faith by appropriate proceedings, and Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower or the affected Subsidiary, as applicable, shall have set aside on its
books reserves in accordance with GAAP with respect thereto and such contest
effectively suspends collection of the contested obligation and the enforcement
of any Lien securing such obligation.

            SECTION 5.04. Financial Statements, Reports, etc. Furnish to the
Administrative Agent (which will furnish such information to the Lenders):

      existed at the time of the acquisition thereof and was not created or made
      binding on such Equity Interests in contemplation of or in connection with

      shall not apply in the case of a joint venture, including a joint venture
      that is a Subsidiary), (iii) any assets acquired after the Restatement
      Effective Date, to the extent that, and for so long as, taking such

      acquisition of such assets (except in the case of assets acquired with
      Indebtedness that constitutes a Capital Lease Obligation, mortgage
      financing or purchase money financing and that is secured by a Lien
      permitted pursuant to Section 6.02(r)) or (iv) any Subsidiary or asset
      with respect to which the Collateral Agent determines that the cost of the
      satisfaction of the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement or the provisions
      of this Section 5.10 with respect thereto exceeds the value of the
      security afforded thereby; provided that upon the reasonable request of
      the Collateral Agent, the U.S. Borrower shall, and shall cause any
      applicable Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to have
      waived or eliminated any contractual obligation of the types described in

connection with any sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of any asset,
including any Equity Interest, the U.S. Borrower would be required by the terms

(ii) acquire assets, Equity Interests or other securities in a manner that is
permitted by Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, in each case in a manner that will
eliminate any such requirement to make such an offer to purchase.

Revolving Facility Loans and New Revolving Facility Loans (in addition to the
other Obligations described therein) shall be secured by a Lien on the
Collateral described therein, (ii) opinions of counsel set forth on Schedule
5.14(b) and (iii) promissory notes evidencing Indebtedness owing to Loan Parties
set forth on Schedule 5.14(c).

            SECTION 5.15. Collateral Release. (a) Immediately upon the
commencement of any Collateral Release Period, the security interests of the
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties in the Collateral shall
automatically be terminated and released; provided that the Guarantee of each
Loan Party of the Obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents shall remain in
effect during any such Collateral Release Period. During any Collateral Release
Period, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall execute and
deliver, at the U.S. Borrower's expense, all documents or other instruments that
the U.S. Borrower shall reasonably request to evidence the termination and
release of such security interests and shall return all Collateral in their
possession to the U.S. Borrower.

                  (b) During any Collateral Release Period:

                  (i) The representations and warranties set forth in Section
            3.17 shall not be required to be true and correct in any respect in
            connection with any Credit Event occurring during such period, and
            the inaccuracy in any respect of such representations and warranties
            shall not give rise to any Default or Event of Default pursuant to
            Section 7.01(a);

                  (ii) Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and the Borrowers shall
            not be required to comply with the terms of Sections 5.02(b), (c),
            (d) or (e);

                  (iii) Holdings, Intermediate Holdings and the Borrowers shall
            not be required to comply with the terms of Section 5.10 to the
            extent such terms require the creation and perfection of security
            interests or Liens on Collateral (it being understood that Holdings,
            Intermediate Holdings and the Borrowers shall continue to be
            required to comply with the terms of Section 5.10 that require the
            provision of Guarantees by Loan Parties in respect of the
            Obligations); and

                  (iv) The occurrence of any of the events described in Section
            7.01(l)(ii) shall not constitute or give rise to any Default or
            Event of Default.

                  (c) Upon the termination of any Collateral Release Period, the
      security interests of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties in the
      Collateral shall automatically, without any further action on the part of
      the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Secured Parties or any
      Loan Party, be reinstated and the provisions of Section 5.15(a) and (b)
      shall no longer apply (until the commencement of a subsequent Collateral
      Release Period). Promptly following the termination of any Collateral
      Release Period, the Loan Parties shall execute any and all documents,
      financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such
      actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements,
      mortgages, fixture filings and other documents) that may be required under
      applicable law or that the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall
      reasonably request, to reinstate such security interests and to cause the
      Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied (all at the expense
      of the Loan Parties), including with respect to any Subsidiaries or assets
      that would have been subjected to the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement
      under Section 5.10 had such terminated Collateral Release Period not been
      in effect; provided that all such actions shall be completed (i) with
      respect to the security interests in Collateral held by Holdings,
      Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and each Domestic Subsidiary Loan
      Party (other than owned real property), no later than 30 days after the
      date of termination of such Collateral Release Period, (ii) with respect
      to Collateral held by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
      and each Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party that constitutes owned real
      property, no later

      Period and (iii) with respect to Collateral held by any Foreign Subsidiary
      Loan Party, no later than 90 days after the date of termination of such
      Collateral Release Period (or, in each case, such later date as the
      Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate).

to the Borrowers, take any or all of the following actions, at the same or

contrary notwithstanding and (iii) demand cash collateral pursuant to Section

referred to in any such clause that did not, as of the last day of the fiscal
quarter of the U.S. Borrower most recently ended, have assets with a value in
excess of 5.0% of the Consolidated Total Assets or 5.0% of total revenues of the
U.S. Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of such date, provided that if it is
necessary to exclude more than one Subsidiary from clause (h) or (i) of Section
7.01 pursuant to this Section 7.02 in order to avoid an Event of Default
thereunder, all excluded Subsidiaries shall be considered to be a single
consolidated Subsidiary for purposes of determining whether the condition
specified above is satisfied.

if applicable, to contribute any such cash to the capital of Intermediate
Holdings (which shall contribute all such cash to the capital of the U.S.
Borrower) (collectively, the "Cure Right"), and upon the receipt by U.S.
Borrower of such cash (the "Cure Amount") pursuant to the exercise of such Cure
Right such Financial Performance Covenant shall be recalculated giving effect to
the following pro forma adjustments:

                  (i) EBITDA shall be increased, solely for the purpose of
            measuring the Financial Performance Covenants and not for any other
            purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount;
            and

                  (ii) If, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations,
            the U.S. Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements
            of all Financial Performance Covenants, the U.S. Borrower shall be
            deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial
            Performance Covenants as of the relevant date of determination with
            the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply
            therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of the
            Financial Performance Covenants that had occurred shall be deemed
            cured for this purposes of the Agreement.

            (b) Limitation on Exercise of Cure Right. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (a) in each four-fiscal-quarter period there shall be at

consecutive fiscal quarters during which the Cure Right is not exercised and (c)

execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this
Agreement or any other Loan Documents or other instruments or agreements. The

acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders
and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any
action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders and all
the Ancillary Lenders. Each Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to the

good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons. Neither the Agents nor any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any responsibility to any
Borrower or any other Loan Party or any other party hereto on account of the
failure, delay in performance or breach by, or as a result of information
provided by, any Lender, Ancillary Lender or Issuing Bank of any of its
obligations hereunder or to any Lender, Ancillary Lender or Issuing Bank on

discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required
Lenders. The Lenders and the Ancillary Lenders further acknowledge and agree
that so long as an Agent shall make any determination to be made by it hereunder
or under any other Loan Document in good faith, such Agent shall have no
liability in respect of such determination to any person. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read

delayed). If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and approved by the U.S. Borrower and shall have accepted such appointment
within 45 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Ancillary Lenders with
the consent of the U.S. Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New
York and an office in London, England (or a bank having an Affiliate with such
an office) having a combined capital and surplus having a Dollar Equivalent that

acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall

same as though it were not an Agent, and the Agents and their Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business
with any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or other Affiliates thereof as if
it were not an Agent.

of its applicable outstanding Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements, as
applicable) of any reasonable expenses

including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders and Ancillary Lenders, which shall
not have been reimbursed by the Loan Parties and(b) to indemnify and hold
harmless each Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on
demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all
liabilities, Taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as Agent
or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent the same shall not have
been reimbursed by the Loan Parties, provided that no Lender or Ancillary Lender
shall be liable to an Agent for any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

            SECTION 8.06. Lack of Reliance on Agents. Each Lender and each
Ancillary Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Agents, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each Ancillary Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agents, any other Lender or any Ancillary Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

            SECTION 8.07. Designation of Affiliates for Foreign Currency Loans.

of its Affiliates to perform the duties to be performed by the Administrative
Agent hereunder with respect to Loans and Borrowings denominated in Foreign

Article VIII shall apply to any such Affiliate mutatis mutandis.

and each Lender and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

            SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i)
other than pursuant to a merger permitted by Section 6.05(b) or 6.05(i), no
Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Agents, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            (b)   (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                        (A) the U.S. Borrower; provided that no consent of the
                  U.S. Borrower shall be required for (1) an assignment of a
                  Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
                  Fund or (2) if an Event of Default has occurred and is
                  continuing, an assignment of any Loan to any assignee
                  (provided that any liability of the Borrowers to an assignee
                  that is an Approved Fund or Affiliate of the assigning Lender
                  under Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.21 shall be limited to the
                  amount, if any, that would have been payable thereunder by
                  such Borrower in the absence of such assignment); and

                        (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent
                  of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an
                  assignment of a Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
                  Lender or Approved Fund

<PAGE>

                                                                             199

                  immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
            conditions:

                        (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
                  Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of
                  the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
                  Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
                  Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
                  date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
                  assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not
                  be less than (x) $5,000,000, in the case of Revolving Credit
                  Commitments, Revolving Loans denominated in Dollars, Tranche A
                  Term Loans and Tranche A-1 Term Loans, (y) the smallest amount
                  of the applicable Foreign Currency that is a multiple of
                  1,000,000 units of such Foreign Currency and has a Dollar
                  Equivalent in excess of $5,000,000, in the case of Tranche D-2
                  Term Loans and Global Revolving Facility Loans denominated in
                  a Foreign Currency and (z) $1,000,000, in the case of Tranche
                  B Term Loans, Tranche D-1 Term Loans, Tranche E Term Loans or
                  Loans in respect of any Incremental Extension of Credit,
                  unless each of the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent
                  otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the U.S.
                  Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under
                  paragraph (b), (c), (h) or (i) of Section 7.01 has occurred
                  and is continuing;

                        (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
                  assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
                  Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement;

                        (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
                  Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
                  $3,500;

                        (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
                  deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
                  Questionnaire; and

                        (E) no assignment of Global Revolving

<PAGE>

                                                                             200

                  Facility Loans or Global Revolving Facility Commitments shall
                  be permitted to be made to an assignee that cannot make Global
                  Revolving Facility Loans in Dollars and each of the Foreign
                  Currencies.

            For purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" shall
have the following meaning:

            "Approved Fund" shall mean any person (other than a natural person)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and
similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is
administered or managed by a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an entity or an
Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
            paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
            specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder
            shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
            by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations
            of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
            thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
            Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under
            this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance
            covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
            this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
            shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15,
            2.16, 2.17 and 9.05). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
            rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
            this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
            a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
            obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
            agent of the U.S. Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a
            copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a
            register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
            Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans
            and L/C Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
            hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the
            Register shall be conclusive, and the U.S. Borrower, the Agents,
            each Issuing Bank and the

<PAGE>

                                                                             201

            Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register
            pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
            of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
            Register shall be available for inspection by the U.S. Borrower, any
            Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to
            time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
            Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
            assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the
            assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
            recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any
            written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this
            Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
            Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
            Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
            Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in
            this paragraph.

            (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the U.S. Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the
Agents, each Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in Section 9.04(a)(i) or clauses (i) (disregarding for this purpose
the parenthetical contained therein), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of the
first proviso to Section 9.08(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, each of the Borrowers agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to
the same extent as if

<PAGE>

                                                                             202

it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as
though it were a Lender.

            (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the U.S.
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless
the U.S. Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and
such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with
Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

            (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

            SECTION 9.05. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The U.S. Borrower agrees to
pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including documentary Taxes) incurred
by the Agents in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, or by the Agents in connection with the syndication of the
Commitments or the administration of this Agreement (including expenses incurred
in connection with due diligence and initial and ongoing Collateral examination
to the extent incurred with the reasonable prior approval of the U.S. Borrower
and the reasonable fees, disbursements and the charges for no more than one
counsel in each jurisdiction where Collateral is located) or in connection with
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof
(whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be consummated) or
incurred by the Agents, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender in connection with
the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, in connection with the Loans made, the Ancillary
Facilities made available pursuant to Section 2.22 or the Letters of Credit
issued hereunder, including the reasonable fees,

<PAGE>

                                                                             203

charges and disbursements of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, and, in connection with any such
enforcement or protection, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any
other counsel (including the reasonable allocated costs of internal counsel if a
Lender elects to use internal counsel in lieu of outside counsel) for the
Agents, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender (but no more than
one such counsel for any Lender or any Ancillary Lender).

            (b) The U.S. Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agents, each Issuing
Bank, each Lender, each Ancillary Lender and each of their respective directors,
trustees, officers, employees and agents (each such person being called an
"Indemnitee") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable
counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the
parties hereto and thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of any Letter of Credit or
(iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses result primarily from
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee (treating, for this
purpose only, any Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender, any Ancillary Lender and
any of their respective Related Parties as a single Indemnitee). Subject to and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the U.S. Borrower
agrees to indemnify each Indemnitee against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless
from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including reasonable counsel or consultant fees, charges and disbursements,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way
connected with, or as a result of (A) any Environmental Claim related in any way
to Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries, or (B) any actual or alleged presence, Release or threatened
Release of Hazardous Materials on any Property or any property owned, leased or
operated by any predecessor of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, provided that such indemnity shall not, as
to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses are determined by a

<PAGE>

                                                                             204

court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee or
any of its Related Parties. The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term
of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any
term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or
any Ancillary Lender. All amounts due under this Section 9.05 shall be payable
on written demand therefor.

            (c) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the U.S. Borrower shall be entitled to assume the defense of any
action for which indemnification is sought hereunder with counsel of its choice
at its expense (in which case the U.S. Borrower shall not thereafter be
responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by an
Indemnitee except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to each such Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the
U.S. Borrower's election to assume the defense of such action, each Indemnitee
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense of such action, and the U.S. Borrower shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of such separate counsel, if (i) the use of counsel chosen by
the U.S. Borrower to represent such Indemnitee would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of,
any such action include both the U.S. Borrower and such Indemnitee and such
Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the
U.S. Borrower (in which case the U.S. Borrower shall not have the right to
assume the defense or such action on behalf of such Indemnitee); (iii) the U.S.
Borrower shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnitee to represent it within a reasonable time after notice of the
institution of such action; or (iv) the U.S. Borrower shall authorize such
Indemnitee to employ separate counsel at the U.S. Borrower's expense. The U.S.
Borrower will not be liable under this Agreement for any amount paid by an
Indemnitee to settle any claims or actions if the settlement is entered into
without the U.S. Borrower's consent, which consent may not be withheld or
delayed unless such settlement is unreasonable in light of such claims or
actions against, and defenses available to, such Indemnitee.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.05,
this Section 9.05 shall not apply to Taxes, it being understood that the U.S.
Borrower's only obligations with respect to Taxes shall arise under Sections
2.15 and 2.17.

            SECTION 9.06. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each Ancillary
Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such
Ancillary Lender to or for the credit or the account of Holdings, Intermediate
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary against any of and all the
obligations of Holdings or the U.S. Borrower now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender, such Issuing Bank
or such Ancillary Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, such
Issuing Bank or such Ancillary Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such other Loan Document and although the obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each Ancillary
Lender under this Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of set-off) that such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such
Ancillary Lender may have.

            SECTION 9.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

            SECTION 9.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the
Agents, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any Ancillary Lender in exercising any
right or power hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, each Issuing Bank, the
Lenders and each Ancillary Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or consent to any departure by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any
Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose
for which given. No notice or

                                                                             206

demand on Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any Borrower or any other Loan Party
in any case shall entitle such person to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances.

            (b) Except as provided in Section 2.23 with respect to an
Incremental Facility Amendment or as provided in the definition of "Restatement
Effective Date", neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the Borrowers and the Required
Lenders, (y) in the case of any Ancillary Facility Document, pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each party thereto and (z) in
the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by each party thereto and the Collateral Agent and
consented to by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement
shall (i) decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final
maturity of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C
Disbursement, without the prior written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby, (ii) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender or decrease the
Commitment Fees or L/C Participation Fees or other fees of any Lender without
the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) extend, waive or change the
amount due on any Installment Date or extend any date on which payment of
interest on any Loan or any L/C Disbursement is due, without the prior written
consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (iv) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would by its terms alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the prior written
consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (v) amend or modify the
provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders", "Majority
Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders or Ancillary Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the
prior written consent of each Lender or Ancillary Lender adversely affected
thereby (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders,
additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in
the determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the
Loans and Commitments are included on the Restatement Effective Date), (vi)
except as set forth in Section 5.15, release all or substantially all the
Collateral or release any of Holdings, Intermediate Holdings or any Subsidiary
Loan Party from its Guarantee under the U.S. Collateral Agreement or the Foreign
Guarantee, as applicable,

of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (vii) effect any waiver, amendment or

            SECTION 9.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and the agreements regarding certain Fees referred to herein
constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to the subject
matter hereof. Any previous agreement among or representations from the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan
Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than

under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH

INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN

enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in
good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

            SECTION 9.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which,

conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Ancillary Lender may otherwise
have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents against Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, any Borrower or any Loan
Party or their properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) Each of Holdings and each Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of

            SECTION 9.16. Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders, each Issuing
Bank, each Ancillary Lender and each of the Agents agrees that it shall maintain
in confidence any information relating to Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the
U.S. Borrower and the other Loan Parties furnished to it by or on behalf of
Holdings, Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the other Loan Parties
(other than information that (a) has become generally available to the public

developed by such Lender, such Issuing Bank, such Ancillary Lender or such Agent
without violating this Section 9.16 or (c) was available to such Lender, such
Issuing Bank, such Ancillary Lender or such Agent from a third party having, to
such person's knowledge, no obligations of confidentiality to Holdings,
Intermediate Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any other Loan Party) and shall not
reveal the same other than to its directors, trustees, officers, employees and
advisors with a need to know or to any person that approves or administers the

Governmental Authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or
of any securities exchange on which securities of the disclosing party or any
Affiliate of the disclosing party are listed or traded, (B) as part of normal

            SECTION 9.17. Conversion of Currencies. (a) If, for the purpose of
obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing
hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto (including
any Foreign Subsidiary

<PAGE>

                                                                             211

Borrower) agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the
rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking
procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased
with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on
which final judgment is given.

            (b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to
any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the
"Applicable Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the
"Judgment Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be
due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that,
on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase
the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrowers
contained in this Section 9.17 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

            SECTION 9.18. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the
Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which
information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the
Act.

            Rates calculated as of the CAM Exchange Date, of such amount and,
            subject to Section 11.01(a)(iv), on and after such date all amounts
            accruing and owed to any Lender or any Ancillary Lender in respect
            of such Obligations shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the
            rates otherwise applicable hereunder;

                  (ii) in the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Unfunded
            Ancillary Credit Extension (in respect of which cash collateral
            shall not have previously been deposited pursuant to Section
            2.22(e)) shall exist, or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
            shall have failed to reimburse a disbursement made by the applicable
            Ancillary Lender, the applicable Ancillary Lender shall promptly pay
            over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an
            amount in Dollars equal to such Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension
            or unreimbursed disbursement, together with interest thereon from
            the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid
            to the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at
            the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to
            such Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension or unreimbursed
            disbursement. The Administrative Agent shall establish an account
            (the "Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension Account") and shall
            deposit all amounts received pursuant to the previous sentence and
            all amounts of cash collateral previously deposited pursuant to
            Section 2.22(e) in the Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension Account
            pending application of such amounts pursuant to Section 11.02. The
            Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control over the
            Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension Account; and

                  (iii) there shall be a deemed buying and selling of interests
            (without regard to Section 9.04) in the outstanding Global Revolving
            Facility Loans and Ancillary Credit Extensions by the Global
            Revolving Facility Lenders (and each Global Revolving Facility
            Lender shall promptly make payment therefor to the Administrative
            Agent in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to
            Loans made by such Global Revolving Facility Lender (and Section
            2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to such payment obligations of
            such Global Revolving Facility Lender) for distribution to the
            applicable Global Revolving Facility Lenders) such that, after

            such deemed buying and selling of interests, each Global Revolving
            Facility Lender holds its ratable share of the Global Revolving
            Facility Loans (based on the respective Global Revolving Facility
            Commitments of the Global Revolving Facility Lenders immediately
            prior to the CAM Exchange Date) of each outstanding Global Revolving
            Facility Loan and each Ancillary Credit Extension.

            SECTION 11.01. Implementation of CAM. (a) On the CAM Exchange Date,
(i) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as
provided in Section 7.01, (ii) each Global Revolving Facility Lender shall
immediately be deemed to have acquired (and shall promptly make payment therefor
to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.04(c)) participations in
the Swingline Loans (other than any Swingline Foreign Currency Loan in respect
of which Global Revolving Facility Lenders have funded their purchase of
participations pursuant to Section 2.04(c)) in an amount equal to such Global
Revolving Facility Lender's ratable share (based on the respective Global
Revolving Facility Commitments of the Global Revolving Facility Lenders
immediately prior to the CAM Exchange Date) of each Swingline Foreign Currency
Loan outstanding on such date, (iii) each U.S. Revolving Facility Lender shall
immediately be deemed to have acquired (and shall promptly make payment therefor
to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.04(c)) participations in
the Swingline Dollar Loans (other than any Swingline Dollar Loan in respect of
which the U.S. Revolving Facility Lenders have funded their purchase of
participations pursuant to Section 2.04(c)) in an amount equal to such U.S.
Revolving Facility Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of each Swingline
Dollar Loan outstanding on such date, (iv) simultaneously with the automatic
conversions pursuant to clause (v) below, the Lenders shall automatically and
without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section 9.04) be
deemed to have exchanged interests in the Loans (other than the Swingline
Loans), Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions and participations in Unfunded
Ancillary Credit Extensions, Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit, such that in
lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Loan, Letter of Credit and Ancillary
Credit Extension in which it shall participate as of such date (including such
Lender's interest in the Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of each such
Loan, Letter of Credit and Ancillary Credit Extension), such Lender shall hold
an interest in every one of the Loans (other than the

<PAGE>

                                                                             214

Swingline Loans) and Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions and a participation in
every one of the Swingline Loans, Letters of Credit and Unfunded Ancillary
Credit Extensions (including the Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of
each such Loan and Ancillary Credit Extension and each Reserve Account
established pursuant to Section 11.02 below), whether or not such Lender shall
previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage
thereof and (v) simultaneously with the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to
clause (iv) above, (A) in the case of the CAM Euro Lenders, the interest in the
Loans and Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions denominated in a currency other
than Euros to be received in such deemed exchange shall, automatically and with
no further action required, be converted into the Euro Equivalent, determined
using the Exchange Rate calculated as of such date, of such amount and on and
after such date all amounts accruing and owed to the CAM Euro Lenders in respect
of such Obligations shall accrue and be payable in Euros at the rates otherwise
applicable hereunder and (B) in the case of the CAM Dollar Lenders, the
interests in the Loans and Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions to be received in
such deemed exchange shall, automatically and with no further action required,
be converted into the Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rate
calculated as of such date, of such amount and on and after such date all
amounts accruing and owed to the CAM Dollar Lenders in respect of such
Obligation shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rate otherwise
applicable hereunder. Each Lender and each Loan Party hereby consents and agrees
to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be
binding upon its successors and assigns and any person that acquires a
participation in its interests in any Loan or Ancillary Credit Extension. Each
Loan Party agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the
respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and
each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it
in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against
delivery of any promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Loans and
Funded Ancillary Credit Extensions so executed and delivered; provided, however,
that the failure of any Loan Party to execute or deliver or of any Lender to
accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the
validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.

            (b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange
Date, each payment received by the Applicable Agent or the Collateral Agent
pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Obligations of each Loan Party
in respect of each

                                                                             215

Loan, Letter of Credit and Ancillary Credit Extension, and each distribution
made by the Collateral Agent pursuant to any Security Document in respect of
such Obligations, shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by a Lender
upon or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of
an Obligation shall be paid over to the Applicable Agent for distribution to the
Lenders in accordance herewith.

            SECTION 11.02. Letters of Credit and Unfunded Ancillary Credit
Extensions. (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit
shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any L/C Disbursement
shall not have been reimbursed either by an Applicant Party or, in the case of
any L/C Disbursement made in Dollars, with the proceeds of a U.S. Revolving
Facility Borrowing or Swingline Dollar Borrowing, each U.S. Revolving Facility
Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent, in immediately
available funds, an amount in Dollars equal to such U.S. Revolving Facility
Lender's U.S. Revolving Facility Percentage of such undrawn face amount (or, in
the case of any Foreign Currency Letter of Credit, the Dollar Equivalent of such
face amount) or (to the extent it has not already done so) such unreimbursed
drawing, as applicable, together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange
Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent
at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a
principal amount equal to such undrawn face amount or unreimbursed drawing, as
applicable. The Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account (each, a
"Reserve Account") or accounts for each Lender for the amounts received with
respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence The
Administrative Agent shall deposit in each Lender's Reserve Account such
Lender's CAM Percentage of (x) the amounts received from the Revolving Credit
Lenders as provided above and (y) the amounts on deposit in the Unfunded
Ancillary Credit Extension Account. The Administrative Agent shall have sole
dominion and control over each Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in
each Reserve Account shall be held in such Reserve Account until withdrawn as
provided in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) below. The Administrative Agent shall
maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and
deposited in the Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and
Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension and the amounts on deposit in respect of
each Letter of Credit and Unfunded

<PAGE>

                                                                             216

Ancillary Credit Extension attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage. The
amounts held in each Lender's Reserve Account shall be held as a reserve against
the Revolving L/C Exposures and payment obligations in respect of Unfunded
Ancillary Credit Extensions, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not
constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against any Loan Party and
shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of the U.S. Borrower to pay
interest to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in
respect of (x) Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings are
made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05, and (y) disbursements under any
Ancillary Facility shall arise only at such time as payments are required under
such Ancillary Facility.

            (b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall
be made in respect of a Letter of Credit or any payment shall be made in respect
of an Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension, the Administrative Agent shall, at
the request of the applicable Issuing Bank or Ancillary Lender, as applicable,
withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to the amount
of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment, deposited in respect
of such Letter of Credit or Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension and remaining on
deposit and deliver such amounts, in the case of a Letter of Credit, to such
Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the U.S.
Revolving Facility Lenders under Section 2.05(d) (but not of the U.S. Borrower
under Section 2.05(e)) or, in the case of an Unfunded Ancillary Credit
Extension, to the applicable Ancillary Lender. In the event that any U.S.
Revolving Facility Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount
to the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 11.02, the applicable
Issuing Bank shall have a claim against such U.S. Revolving Facility Lender to
the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section
2.05(d), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such
defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the applicable
Borrower's reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 11.01. Each other
Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting U.S. Revolving Facility Lender
for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the
event that such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the
defaulted amount.

            (c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of
Credit shall expire undrawn, or an Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension shall
expire without requiring payment, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from
the Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in
respect of such Letter of Credit, or Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension, as
applicable, and distribute such amount to such Lender.

            (d) With the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent (not
to be unreasonably withheld), any

<PAGE>

                                                                             217

Lender may withdraw the amount held in its Reserve Account in respect of the
undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit or Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension.
Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally obligated, in the
event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit or
payment in respect of an Unfunded Ancillary Credit Extension, to pay over to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank or Ancillary Lender,
as applicable, on demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment.

            (e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its
Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative
Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the
Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest
such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its
amounts in its Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (d) above shall have the
right, at intervals reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, to
withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the Administrative Agent with
amounts in its Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account.

obligations of the Borrowers under the Existing Credit Agreement shall become
obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, secured by the Security Documents, and
the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement shall be superseded by the
provisions hereof.
