      (a)   Interest Payments.

            (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.2.1(ii), interest shall accrue
on the Principal Amount as set forth in the Note.

            (ii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of

not repaid on the Maturity Date, interest on the outstanding principal balance
of the Loan and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest and other

            (iii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a material

being agreed that an earlier alphabetical designation of any note class shall be

interest at the Default Rate or other charges as provided therein, shall be due

advance or charge is not so repaid by Borrower, Lender may, at its option and
upon notice to Borrower, first apply any payments received under the Note to
repay such advances, together with any interest thereon, or other charges as
provided in the Loan Documents, and the balance, if any, shall be applied in
payment of any installment of interest or principal then due and payable.

      (c)   The Maturity Date Payment shall be due and payable in full on the
Maturity Date.

            2.2.3 LATE PAYMENT CHARGE. If any interest payment due under the
Loan Documents is not paid by Borrower within five (5) days after the date on
which it is due (or, if such fifth (5th) day is not a Business Day, then the
Business Day immediately following such day), Borrower shall pay to Lender upon
demand an amount equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) of such unpaid sum or
the Maximum Legal Rate (the LATE PAYMENT CHARGE) in order to defray the expense
incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent payment and to
compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent payment. Any such
amount shall be secured by this Agreement, the Security Instrument and the other
Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law. Borrower acknowledges
and agrees that the five day grace

                                       45
<PAGE>

period with respect to the applicability of the Late Payment Charge (i) shall
only apply to Borrower's first failure to make a monthly interest payment in any
calendar year and (ii) shall not constitute a payment grace period and shall in
no way limit Lender's rights under Article XVII.

            2.2.4 USURY SAVINGS. This Agreement and the Note are subject to the
express condition that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay
interest on the Principal Amount of the Loan at a rate which could subject
Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of
the Maximum Legal Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the
Principal Amount due under the Note at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate, then the Applicable Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous
payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been
payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due under
the Note. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance,
or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the
full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of
interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of
interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as
the Loan is outstanding.

      SECTION 2.3 PREPAYMENTS.

            2.3.1 PREPAYMENTS. No prepayments of the Indebtedness shall be
permitted except as set forth in Section 4 of the Note. Borrower agrees and
acknowledges after the closing of the Loan that prior to a material Event of
Default (as determined by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion) (x) in the
case of prepayments of the Loan in connection with a Casualty or Condemnation,
principal will be applied (to the event not used for restoration pursuant to the
terms hereof) to the Note (and any substitute or component notes, as applicable)
sequentially starting with the most senior securitized tranche and (y) in the
case of all other prepayments of the Loan, such prepayments will be applied to
any substitute or component notes created pursuant to Section 5.1.11 pro-rata
(on the basis of their respective principal balances if more than one Note
exists) among the securitized and any non-securitized portions of the Loan (and
pro-rata within the securitized portions of the Loan). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a material Event of
Default (as determined by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion), Borrower
agrees and acknowledges that any principal prepayments of the Loan will be
applied to any substitute or component notes created pursuant to Section 5.1.11
sequentially, starting with the most senior securitized tranche (it being
acknowledged that during the continuance of a material Event of Default all
securitized portions of the Loan shall be paid in full prior to the payment of
any non-securitized portions of the Loan).

            2.3.2 PREPAYMENTS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. If, following an Event of
Default, Lender shall accelerate the Indebtedness and Borrower thereafter
tenders payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness, or if all or any portion
of the Indebtedness is recovered by Lender after such Event of Default, (a) such
payment may be made only on the next occurring Payment Date together with all
unpaid interest thereon as calculated through the end of the Interest Period
during which such Payment Date occurs (even if such period extends beyond such
Payment Date and calculated as if such payment had not been made on such Payment
Date), and all other fees

                                       46
<PAGE>

and sums payable hereunder or under the Loan Documents, including without
limitation, interest that has accrued at the Default Rate and any Late Payment
Charges), (b) such payment shall be deemed a voluntary prepayment by Borrower,
and (c) Borrower shall pay, in addition to the Indebtedness, an amount equal to
the Liquidated Damages Amount.

            2.3.3 RELEASE OF PROPERTY UPON LOAN REPAYMENT IN FULL. Lender shall,
at the reasonable expense of Borrower, upon (i) payment in full of the Principal
Amount and interest on the Loan and all other amounts due and payable under the
Loan Documents in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Note and this
Agreement, or (ii) a Defeasance Event as provided in Section 2.3.4 below,
release the Lien of this Agreement upon the Account Collateral and the Security
Instrument (and the Pledge Agreement, if applicable) on the Property, or the
applicable Property or Properties if the entire Principal Amount is not paid or
defeased in full, or assign it, in whole or in part, to a new lender. In such
event, Borrower shall submit to Lender, on a date prior to the date of such
release or assignment sufficient to provide a reasonable period for review
thereof, a release of lien or assignment of lien, as applicable, for such
property for execution by Lender. Such release or assignment, as applicable,
shall be in a form appropriate in each jurisdiction in which the Property is
located and satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable discretion. In addition,
Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably requires to be
delivered by Borrower in connection with such release or assignment, as
applicable.

            2.3.4 DEFEASANCE.

      (a)   Provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and remain uncured,
Borrower shall have the right at any time (i) with respect to the Claremont
Property, and (ii) after the Defeasance Lockout Period and prior to the
Prepayment Lockout Release Date with respect to any Property other than the
Claremont Property, to voluntarily defease the Loan in whole or in part and
obtain the release of the Property, or applicable Property or Properties if
defeased only in part, by and upon satisfaction of the following conditions
(such event being a DEFEASANCE EVENT):

            (i)   Borrower shall provide not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Lender specifying the date (the DEFEASANCE DATE) on which the
Defeasance Event shall occur, which notice shall be revocable by Borrower but
not more than two (2) times in any twelve (12) month period provided, however,
if Borrower elects to so revoke any such notice, Borrower shall reimburse Lender
for the actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lender in connection with such
revocation;

            (ii)  Except with respect to a defeasance of the Claremont Property,
the Portfolio DSCR after giving effect to the Defeasance Event shall not be less
than the greater of (a) 1.4 to 1.0, and (b) 90% of the Portfolio DSCR
immediately prior to such Defeasance Event;

            (iii) Borrower shall pay to Lender all accrued and unpaid interest
on the portion of the principal balance of the Loan then being defeased to and
including the Defeasance Date;

                                       47
<PAGE>

            (iv)  Borrower shall pay to Lender all other sums, not including
scheduled interest or principal payments, then due and payable under the Note,
this Agreement, the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents;

            (v)   Borrower shall deliver to Lender, at Borrower's option, either
(x) the Defeasance Deposit, or (y) the Defeasance Collateral (in an amount equal
to or greater than that which could otherwise be purchased with the Defeasance
Deposit had the required Defeasance Deposit been delivered by Borrower);

            (vi)  Borrower shall execute and deliver a pledge and security
agreement, in form and substance that would be reasonably satisfactory to a
prudent lender creating a first priority lien on the Defeasance Collateral, in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3.4 (the SECURITY AGREEMENT);

            (vii) Borrower shall deliver an opinion of counsel for Borrower that
is standard in commercial lending transactions and subject only to customary
qualifications, assumptions and exceptions opining, among other things, that
Borrower has duly and validly transferred and assigned to the Successor Borrower
the Defeasance Collateral and all obligations, rights and duties under and to
the Note that are attributable to the Property, that Lender has a perfected
first priority security interest in the Defeasance Collateral delivered by
Borrower, and shall pay all costs of Lender obtaining an opinion of counsel that
is standard in similar transactions that any REMIC Trust formed pursuant to a
Securitization will not fail to maintain its status as a "real estate mortgage
investment conduit" within the meaning of Section 860D of the Code as a result
of such Defeasance Event;

            (viii) Borrower shall obtain confirmation in writing from the
applicable Rating Agencies to the effect that the Defeasance Collateral to be
purchased qualifies and is sufficient so that the substitution of such
Defeasance Collateral for the Property or Properties being released will not
result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the respective ratings in
effect immediately prior to such Defeasance Event for the Securities issued in
connection with the Securitization which are then outstanding. If required by
the applicable Rating Agencies, Borrower shall also deliver or cause to be
delivered a Non-Consolidation Opinion with respect to the Successor Borrower in
form and substance (i) reasonably satisfactory to a prudent lender and (ii)
satisfactory to the applicable Rating Agencies;

            (ix)  Borrower shall deliver a certificate that would be reasonably
satisfactory to a prudent lender given by an Independent Accountant engaged by
Borrower certifying that the Defeasance Collateral shall generate monthly
amounts equal to or greater than the Scheduled Defeasance Payments required to
be paid under the Note and this Agreement through and including the Maturity
Date with respect to the Individual Properties that are subject to such
Defeasance Event;

            (x)   Borrower shall deliver such other certificates, documents or
instruments as a prudent lender would reasonably require; and

            (xi)  Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses of Lender incurred
in connection with the Defeasance Event, including (A) any costs and expenses
associated with a

                                       48
<PAGE>

release (in full or in part, as applicable) of the Lien of the Security
Instrument as provided in Section 2.3.3 hereof, (B) reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Defeasance Event, (C) the costs and
expenses of the Rating Agencies, and (D) any revenue, documentary stamp or
intangible taxes or any other tax or charge due in connection with the transfer
of the Note, or otherwise required to accomplish the defeasance.

      (b)   In connection with any Defeasance Event, Borrower shall purchase
Defeasance Collateral (or Lender shall use the Defeasance Deposit to purchase
such Defeasance Collateral) which provide payments on or prior to, but as close
as possible to, all successive scheduled Payment Dates after the Defeasance Date
upon which interest payments are required under this Agreement and the Note and
in amounts equal to the scheduled payments allocable to the Allocated Loan
Amount of the Property(ies) being released pursuant to such Defeasance Event due
on such Payment Dates under this Agreement and the Note of (including, without
limitation, the scheduled payments of principal, interest, and any other amounts
due under the Loan Documents on such dates and the payment of such Note in full
on the Maturity Date) (the SCHEDULED DEFEASANCE PAYMENTS). Borrower, pursuant to
the Security Agreement or other appropriate document, shall authorize and direct
that the payments received from the Defeasance Collateral may be made directly
to the Collection Account (unless otherwise directed by Lender) and applied to
satisfy the obligations of Borrower or Successor Borrower, if applicable, under
this Agreement and the Note. Any portion of the Defeasance Deposit in excess of
the amount necessary to purchase the Defeasance Collateral required by this
Section 2.3 and satisfy Borrower's other obligations hereunder shall be remitted
to Borrower.

      (c)   The Defeasance Collateral shall be duly endorsed by the holder
thereof as directed by Lender or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form and substance that would be reasonably satisfactory to a prudent lender
(including, without limitation, such instruments as may be reasonably required
by the depository institution holding such securities or by the issuer thereof,
as the case may be, to effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the
book-entry facilities of such institution) in order to perfect upon the delivery
of the Defeasance Collateral a first priority security interest therein in favor
of the Lender in conformity with all applicable state and federal laws governing
the granting of such security interests.

      (d)   Borrower may at its option, or if so required by the applicable
Rating Agencies shall, establish or designate a successor entity (the SUCCESSOR
BORROWER) which shall be a single purpose bankruptcy remote entity approved by
the Rating Agencies with one (1) Independent Director, and the applicable
Borrower(s) shall transfer and assign all obligations, rights and duties under
and to the Note, together with the pledged Defeasance Collateral to such
Successor Borrower. Such Successor Borrower shall assume the obligations under
the Note and the Security Agreement and the applicable Borrower(s) shall be
relieved of its obligations under such documents. Borrower shall pay $1,000 to
any such Successor Borrower as consideration for assuming the obligations under
the Note and the Security Agreement.

      (e)   If Borrower has elected to defease the Loan or any allocated portion
thereof, and the requirements set forth in this Section 2.3.4 have been
satisfied, the applicable Property or Properties shall be released from the Lien
of the Security Instrument as provided in this Section and the Defeasance
Collateral, pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement, shall be the substitute
source of collateral securing such amounts due under the Note. Further, the
pledge of

                                       49
<PAGE>

the related Account Collateral, the Collateral Accounts and other
property pledged under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and all other
obligations of Borrower created hereunder in respect of such Property or
Properties shall be discharged, except as specifically provided to the contrary
in the applicable Loan Document.

      (f)   Borrower shall submit to Lender not less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the Defeasance Date (which must be on a Business Day), a release of
Liens (and related Loan Documents) for each applicable Property (for execution
by Lender) in a form appropriate in the applicable state and otherwise
satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable discretion and all other documentation
Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such
Defeasance Event (collectively, RELEASE INSTRUMENTS) for each applicable
Property (for execution by Lender) together with an Officer's Certificate
certifying that (i) the Release Instruments are in compliance with all Legal
Requirements, (ii) the Defeasance Event will not violate the terms of this
Agreement, (iii) the release to be effected will not impair or otherwise
adversely affect the Liens, security interests and other rights of Lender under
the Loan Documents not being released (or as to the parties to the Loan
Documents and Properties subject to the Loan Documents not being released), (iv)
the requirement described in Section 2.3.4(a)(ii) above is satisfied in
connection with such Defeasance Event (together with calculations demonstrating
the same in reasonable detail), and Mortgage Borrower General Partner has
withdrawn and been replaced as the general partner of the applicable Borrower
transferring the applicable Property or that such Borrower will be dissolved
immediately after such Defeasance Event.

            2.3.5 RELEASE OF CERTAIN OUTPARCELS.

      (a)   Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Borrower may request that Lender release additional portions of certain Property
in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3.5. Prior to releasing any
property from the Lien of the Security Instrument (and the Pledge Agreement, if
applicable), any such release pursuant to this Section 2.3.5, in addition to
satisfying the additional conditions set forth below with respect to a
particular release of a portion of a Property, Borrower shall have satisfied the
following conditions (collectively, RELEASE CONDITIONS), as determined by Lender

                                       50
<PAGE>

released parcel and the Remaining Property and (ii) after such release, will be

such release; (8) Lender shall have determined (such determination not to be

reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender (including,
without limitation, attorneys fees and any applicable costs and expenses of the
Rating Agencies) in connection with each such release; (10) Borrower shall have
provided Lender at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of such requested
release; (11) if a principal payment is due to Lender in connection with such

hereinafter collectively referred to as the GENERAL RELEASE CONDITIONS.

      (b)   Biltmore Property Expansion Project: Borrower intends to pursue the
development of certain portions of the Biltmore Property identified on the map
attached hereto as Exhibit "R-1" and labeled as "Resort Expansion Parcels." Such
projects (RESORT EXPANSION PROJECTS) are anticipated to include the development
of high-end residential product (including for sale, for rent and time-share
dwellings and/or hotel rooms and vacation ownership dwellings) anticipated to be
managed by a Borrower Subsidiary as part of a rental management program similar
to the Borrower Subsidiaries' current programs at the Biltmore Property and the
La Quinta Property (the RENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM). The release price for the
Resort Expansion Projects will be Zero Dollars ($0), provided, (i) if any
release of a Resort Expansion Parcel results in the elimination of any existing
hotel rooms and/or any material (as "material" is determined by Lender in its
sole but reasonable discretion) resort amenity other than the existing tennis
courts and putting course shown on Exhibit "R-1", Borrower shall complete a new
development on the Resort Expansion Parcel within 12 months (subject to
Excusable Delay and

                                       51
<PAGE>

subject to an outside completion date of the Payment Date in
November, 2007) from the date of such release (such expansion shall have no
fewer than 60 rooms representing 60 individual keys) which complies in all
material respects with all Legal Requirements and the terms hereof (with
delivery of a permanent certificate of occupancy for such development delivered
to Lender before the expiration of such 12 month period or, if no such permanent
certificate of occupancy has been issued, delivery to Lender of a temporary
certificate of occupancy with no material conditions remaining that are
necessary to deliver a permanent certificate of occupancy to Lender), and (ii)
after development of any Resort Expansion Parcel at least thirty (30) keys to
individual rooms on any such Resort Expansion Parcel are part of a rental
management program in form reasonably acceptable to Lender that is collaterally
assigned to Lender.

      (c)   As a condition to the release or reconveyance of each Resort
Expansion Parcel from the Lien of the Security Instrument, Borrower shall have
satisfied the General Release Conditions and the following conditions, as
determined by Lender (such determination not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed): (1) the Resort Expansion Parcels released or reconveyed hereunder
shall not result in the elimination of more than thirty (30) existing hotel
rooms and/or any material resort amenity other than the existing tennis courts
and putting course shown on Exhibit "R-1"; (2) Borrower shall have obtained all
discretionary governmental approvals necessary to entitle the development rights
of the Resort Expansion Project to be developed on such Resort Expansion Parcel
(without any material adverse effect in relation to the Remaining Property) as
required by the municipal (whether city and/or county) governmental agencies
having jurisdiction to make land use and planning determinations regarding such
Resort Expansion Project (which may include, by way of illustration, any of the
following approvals to the extent required by applicable law: zoning approvals,
conditional use permits, tentative tract map or parcel map approvals or site
plan review); (3) Lender shall have determined that the proposed uses and
structures to be developed on the Resort Expansion Parcel are materially
consistent and/or complementary with the existing uses of the applicable
Property and which could not materially and adversely affect the Remaining
Property; and (4) the rental management program and the documents evidencing
same shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender and
collaterally assigned to Lender together with all gross revenue (less only bona
fide commissions paid to cooperating brokers and sales agents of the applicable
Borrower Subsidiary on an arms length basis) generated pursuant to such program
from the Resort Expansion Parcel. Borrower shall (a) cause such Resort Expansion
Parcel to be developed (if at all) with uses and structures materially
consistent and/or complementary with the existing uses of the applicable
Property and (b) cause all gross revenue generated from the Resort Expansion
Parcel (less only bona fide commissions paid to cooperating brokers and sales
agents of the applicable Borrower Subsidiary on an arms length basis) to be
collaterally assigned to Lender. The foregoing covenants of Borrower shall
survive the release of any such property.

      (d)   Existing Parking Parcels: From and after the Prepayment Lockout
Release Date, Borrower may request that Lender release from the lien of the
Security Instrument yet-to-be-determined portions of the parking lots and/or
existing tennis courts which serve the Doral Property which are depicted on the
maps attached hereto as Exhibit "R-2" (the GREEN VIEW PARCEL), Exhibit "R-3"
(the AQUA VIEW PARCEL) and Exhibit R-4 (the SPA VIEW PARCEL, and together with
the Green View Parcel and Aqua View Parcel, each, an EXISTING PARKING PARCEL,
and collectively the EXISTING PARKING PARCELS). The release price for each
Existing Parking Parcel shall be Zero Dollars ($0).

                                       52
<PAGE>

            Prior to releasing or reconveying any such property from the Loan,
Borrower shall have satisfied the General Release Conditions. Additionally,
prior to requesting a release or reconveyance of all or any part of an Existing
Parking Parcel, Borrower shall furnish to Lender for its review and approval,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, an alternative interim and
final parking plan to replace parking located on such Existing Parking Parcel
with parking elsewhere on the applicable Property, which parking plan shall also
include a description of the portion or portions of the Existing Parking Parcel
that Borrower requests be released or reconveyed. The parking plan submitted by
Borrower shall include evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the
interim and final replacement parking, together with other parking lots located
on any other Existing Parking Parcel, (i) will comply in all material respects
with laws or granted governmental approvals applicable to parking requirements
(including, without limitation, the number of required spaces for the
then-existing uses of the applicable Property and the size, configuration and
location of such spaces), and (ii) will not materially and adversely affect the
value, use or operation of the applicable Property. Lender's approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of such parking plan shall be a condition to
the release or reconveyance of all or any part of an Existing Parking Parcel. If
and to the extent the approved parking plan provides for continued use of all or
any part of the Existing Parking Parcel for parking, the same shall no longer
constitute an Existing Parking Parcel hereunder unless and until Borrower shall
have furnished to Lender, and Lender shall have approved, a revised parking plan
(in conformity with the foregoing requirements) that provides that the same is
not required for use for parking. Borrower shall (i) in the case of each
Existing Parking Parcel (or portion thereof) that is transferred to an Affiliate
of Borrower, cause such Existing Parking Parcel (or portion thereof) to be
developed (if at all) with uses and structures materially consistent and/or
complementary with the existing uses at the applicable Property, and (ii) in the
case of each Existing Parking Parcel (or portion thereof) that is transferred to
any person or entity that is not an Affiliate of Borrower, impose deed
restrictions (which run with the land) or obtain such transferee's covenant
(which, in either case, shall be enforceable by the owner of the applicable
Remaining Property and its successors and assigns) to be developed as provided
in clause (i) above. Borrower shall further covenant and agree to enforce,
consistent with Borrower's reasonable business judgment, such transferee's deed
restrictions and covenants. Lender's approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of the deed restrictions or covenants provided for in
clause (ii) above shall be an additional condition to the release or
reconveyance of any Existing Parking Parcel or portion thereof. The foregoing
covenants of Borrower shall survive the release of any such property.

      (e)   Other Out-Parcels: Borrower may request a release from the Lien of
the Security Instrument yet-to-be-determined portions of the outlying parcels
(or Borrower's beneficial interest therein) at the La Quinta Property and the
Doral Property which are generally depicted on the maps attached hereto as
Exhibits "R-5" (Gold View Parcel), Exhibit R-6" (PGA WEST CORE PARCELS; each of
Gold View and each PGA West Core Parcel are individually referred to herein as
an OTHER OUT-PARCEL and collectively are referred to herein as the OTHER
OUT-PARCELS). The release price for each Other Out-Parcel shall be Zero Dollars
$0.

            Prior to releasing any such property from the Loan, Borrower shall
have satisfied the General Release Conditions. Additionally, Borrower shall (i)
in the case of each Other Out-Parcel (or portion thereof)) that is transferred
to an affiliate of Borrower, cause such parcel (or portion thereof) to be
developed (if at all) with uses and structures materially consistent and/or

                                       53
<PAGE>

complementary with the existing uses at the applicable Property, and (ii) in the
case of each Other Out-Parcel (or portion thereof) that is transferred to any
person or entity that is not an affiliate of Borrower, impose deed restrictions
(which run with the land) or obtain such transferee's covenant (which, in either
case, shall be enforceable by the owner of the applicable Remaining Property and
its successors and assigns) to be developed as provided in clause (i) above.
Borrower shall further covenant and agree to enforce, consist of the Borrower's
reasonable judgment, such transferee's deed restrictions and covenants. Lender's
approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the deed
restrictions or covenants provided for in clause (ii) above shall be an
additional condition to the release or reconveyance of any Other Out-Parcel or
portion thereof. The foregoing covenants of Borrower shall survive the release
of any such property.

      (f)   Silver Course: From and after the Prepayment Lockout Release Date,

parcel identified on the map attached hereto as Exhibit R-6 (the SILVER COURSE).
Silver Course shall only be released if the General Release Conditions are
complied with. The release price for the Silver Course shall be Zero Dollars $0.

      (g)   Future Cooperation: Lender acknowledges that Borrower may seek
Lender's consent to release or reconfigure certain portions of the "Red Course"
and "Gold Course" at the Doral Property and certain other parking and tennis
arrangements located at or within each Property generally. Any consent by Lender
to such release or reconfiguring will be subject to Borrower's satisfaction of
the General Release Conditions and such other conditions as Lender (or Servicer
on Lender's behalf) shall reasonably impose; however, such releases shall not
require any prepayment of the Loan. Additionally, Lender acknowledges that
Borrower may seek Lender's consent to (i) expand the number of rooms at the
Claremont Property and (ii) sell certain private golf clubs, tennis and
associated facilities at the Property. Any consent by Lender to such expansion
projects or sales will be subject to Borrower's satisfaction of the applicable
General Release Conditions and such other conditions as Lender (or Servicer on
Lender's behalf) shall reasonably impose. Lender hereby pre-approves (i)
Borrower's right to seek zoning and development entitlements (x) to expand the
room count at the Claremont Property and (y) relative to parcels subject to
release pursuant to this Section 2.3.5 (provided such releases would not result
in a material adverse affect on the use or value of the remainder of the
Property not subject to release).

            2.3.6 RELEASE OF CLAREMONT PROPERTY. From and after the Closing
Date, and subject to satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) below, and in addition to Borrower's option to defease
the principal amounts allocated to the Claremont Property under Section 2.3.4
above, Borrower may obtain (i) the release of the Claremont Property from the
Lien of the Security Instrument thereon and related Loan Documents, (ii) the
release of the obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents (except
with respect to any obligations or liabilities that relate solely to the
Claremont Property and which pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents are
expressly stated to survive any such release or payment of the Loan) and (iii)
the remittance to Borrower of any amounts held in any Collateral Accounts
specifically relating to, or otherwise equitably allocable to, the Claremont
Property:

                                       54
<PAGE>

      (a)   (i) Borrower shall have paid the Yield Maintenance Premium for the
Claremont Property in connection with such prepayment of the Loan, (ii) each
Mezzanine Borrower shall have prepaid each of the Mezzanine Loans by the
applicable "release amount" that is required to be repaid with respect to a
release of the Claremont Property.

      (b)   Borrower shall submit to Lender not less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the date of such release (which must be on a Business Day) Release
Instruments (and related Loan Documents) for the Claremont Property (for
execution by Lender) in a form appropriate in the applicable state and otherwise
satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable discretion and all other documentation
Lender reasonably requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such
release for the Claremont Property (for execution by Lender) together with an
Officer's Certificate certifying that (i) the Release Instruments are in
compliance with all Legal Requirements, (ii) the release to be effected will not
violate the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the release to be effected will not
impair or otherwise adversely affect the Liens, security interests and other
rights of Lender under the Loan Documents not being released (or as to the
parties to the Loan Documents and Properties subject to the Loan Documents not
being released), (iv) Mortgage Borrower General Partner has withdrawn and been
replaced as the general partner of the Claremont Borrower.

            2.3.7 FURTHER ASSURANCES. To the extent any Release Instrument
executed and delivered under Section 2.3.4(b) or Section 2.3.6(b) or any
Outparcel Release Instrument executed and delivered under Section 2.3.5(a) is
insufficient to effect the release to be effected in accordance with the terms
hereof, Lender (and any servicer in connection with a Securitization) shall
remain obligated to execute and deliver, at the expense of the Borrower, such
further Release Instruments or Outparcel Release Instruments as Borrower may
reasonably request and submit to Lender, together with an Officer's Certificate
covering the matters to be covered in the Officer's Certificate described in
Section 2.3.4(f), Section 2.3.6(b) or Section 2.3.5(a).

      SECTION 2.4 REGULATORY CHANGE; TAXES.

            2.4.1 INCREASED COSTS. If, at any time prior to the first
Securitization of the Loan, as a result of any Regulatory Change or compliance
of Lender therewith, the basis of taxation of payments to Lender of the
principal of or interest on the Loan is changed or Lender or the company
Controlling Lender shall be subject to (i) any tax, duty, charge or withholding
of any kind with respect to this Agreement (excluding federal taxation of the
overall net income of Lender); or (ii) any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any
deposits with or other liabilities, of Lender or any company Controlling Lender
is imposed, modified or deemed applicable; or (iii) any other condition
affecting loans to borrowers with fixed interest rates is imposed on Lender or
any company Controlling Lender and Lender determines that, by reason thereof,
the cost to Lender or any company Controlling Lender of making, maintaining or
extending the Loan to Borrower is increased, or any amount receivable by Lender
or any company Controlling Lender hereunder in respect of any portion of the
Loan to Borrower is reduced, in each case by an amount deemed by Lender in good
faith to be material (such increases in cost and reductions in amounts
receivable being herein called INCREASED COSTS), then Lender shall provide
notice thereof to Borrower and Borrower agrees that it will pay to Lender upon
Lender's written request such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
Lender or any company Controlling Lender for such Increased

                                       55
<PAGE>

Costs to the extent Lender determines that such Increased Costs are allocable to
the Loan and provided that Lender is generally exercising rights similar to
those set forth in this Section 2.4.1 against other borrowers similarly situated
to Borrower. Lender will notify Borrower of any event occurring after the date
hereof which will entitle Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.4.1
as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to
request such compensation; provided, however, that, if Lender fails to deliver a
notice within 90 days after the date on which an officer of Lender responsible
for overseeing this Agreement knows or has reason to know of its right to
additional compensation under this Section 2.4.1, Lender shall only be entitled
to additional compensation for any such Increased Costs incurred from and after
the date that is 90 days prior to the date Borrower received such notice. If
Lender requests compensation under this Section 2.4.1, Borrower may, by notice
to Lender, require that Lender furnish to Borrower a statement setting forth the
basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount
thereof, and a description as to why Section 2.4.1 is not applicable.

            2.4.2 SPECIAL TAXES. At all times prior to the first Securitization
of the Loan, Borrower shall make all payments hereunder free and clear of and
without deduction for Special Taxes. If, at any time prior to the first
Securitization of the Loan, Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any
Special Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other
Loan Document to Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.4.2) Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) Borrower shall make such deductions, and (iii) Borrower shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

            2.4.3 OTHER TAXES. In addition, for all periods prior to the first
Securitization of the Loan, Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp
or documentary taxes or other excise or property taxes, charges, or similar
levies which arise from any payment made hereunder, or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents, or the Loan (hereinafter referred to as OTHER TAXES).

            2.4.4 INDEMNITY. Borrower shall indemnify Lender for all periods
prior to the first Securitization of the Loan, for the full amount of Special
Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Special Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any
Governmental Authority on amounts payable under this Section 2.4.4) paid by
Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Special Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made
within thirty (30) days after the date Lender makes written demand therefor.

            2.4.5 CHANGE OF OFFICE. To the extent that changing the jurisdiction
of Lender's applicable office would have the effect of minimizing Special Taxes,
Other Taxes or Increased Costs, Lender shall use reasonable efforts to make such
a change, provided that same would not otherwise be disadvantageous to Lender.

            2.4.6 SURVIVAL. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of Borrower
contained in this Section 2.4

                                       56
<PAGE>

shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder, and the
termination of this Agreement.

      SECTION 2.5 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CLOSING.

            The obligation of Lender to make the Loan hereunder is subject to
the fulfillment by, or on behalf of, Borrower or waiver by Lender of the
following conditions precedent no later than the Closing Date; provided,
however, that unless a condition precedent shall expressly survive the Closing

deemed to have waived any such conditions not theretofore fulfilled or
satisfied:

simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, pursuant to the Account
Agreement, it has established with Cash Management Bank, in the name of Borrower
for the benefit of Lender, as secured party, the collection account (the
COLLECTION ACCOUNT), which has been established as an interest-bearing deposit
account, and the holding account (the HOLDING ACCOUNT), which has been
established as a securities account. Both the Collection and the Holding Account
and each sub-account of either such account and the funds deposited therein and
the securities and other assets credited thereto shall serve as additional
security for the Loan. Pursuant to the Account Agreement, Borrower shall
irrevocably instruct and authorize Cash Management Bank to disregard any and all
orders for withdrawal from the Collection Account or the Holding Account made

Capital Corporation, as secured party Collection Account," account number
1014253644." The Holding Account shall be named as follows: "CNL Portfolio Loan
f/b/o German American Capital Corporation, as secured party Holding Account,"
account number 1014253505. Borrower confirms that it has established with Cash
Management Bank the following sub-accounts of the Holding Account (each, a
"Sub-Account" and, collectively, the "Sub-Accounts" and together with the
Holding Account and the Collection Account, the COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS), which (i)
may be ledger or book entry sub-accounts and need not be actual sub-accounts,
(ii) shall each be linked to the Holding Account, (iii) shall each be a
"Securities Account" pursuant to Article 8 of the UCC and (iv) shall each be an
Eligible Account to which certain funds shall be allocated and from which
disbursements shall be made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:

Impositions and Other Charges for the Property with the account number
1014253505FR4 (the TAX RESERVE ACCOUNT);

      (b)   a sub-account for the retention of Account Collateral in respect of
insurance premiums for the Property with the account number 1014253505FR5 (the

<PAGE>

      (d)   a sub-account for the retention of Account Collateral in respect of
certain Proceeds as more fully set forth in Section 6.2 with the account number

RESERVE ACCOUNT).

            3.1.2 PLEDGE OF ACCOUNT COLLATERAL. To secure the full and punctual
payment and performance of the Obligations, Borrower hereby collaterally
assigns, grants a security interest in and pledges to Lender, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law, a first priority continuing security interest in
and to the following property of Borrower, whether now owned or existing or
hereafter acquired or arising and regardless of where located (all of the same,
collectively, the ACCOUNT COLLATERAL):

      (a)   the Collateral Accounts, Manager Accounts and the Membership Deposit
Account and all cash, checks, drafts, securities entitlements, certificates,
instruments and other property, including, without limitation, all deposits
and/or wire transfers from time to time deposited or held in, credited to or

            3.1.3 MAINTENANCE OF COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS.

      (a)   Borrower agrees that the Collection Account is and shall be
maintained (i) as a "deposit account" (as such term is defined in Section
9-102(a) of the UCC), (ii) in such a manner that Lender shall have control
(within the meaning of Section 9-104(a) of the UCC) over the Collection Account
and (iii) such that neither the Borrower nor Manager shall have any right of

                                       62
<PAGE>

withdrawal from the Collection Account and, except as provided herein, no
Account Collateral shall be released to the Borrower or Manager from the
Collection Account. Without limiting the Borrower's obligations under the
immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall only establish and maintain the
Collection Account with a financial institution that has executed an agreement
substantially in the form of the Account Agreement or in such other form
acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion.

      (b)   Borrower agrees that each of the Holding Account and the
Sub-Accounts is and shall be maintained (i) as a "securities account" (as such
term is defined in Section 8-501(a) of the UCC), (ii) in such a manner that
Lender shall have control (within the meaning of Section 8-106(d)(2) of the UCC)
over the Holding Account and any Sub-Account, (iii) such that neither Borrower
nor Manager shall have any right of withdrawal from the Holding Account or the
Sub-Accounts and, except as provided herein, no Account Collateral shall be
released to Borrower from the Holding Account or the Sub-Accounts, (iv) in such
a manner that the Cash Management Bank shall agree to treat all property
credited to the Holding Account or the Sub-Accounts as "financial assets" and

credited to the Accounts shall be registered in the name of Cash Management
Bank, indorsed to Cash Management Bank or in blank or credited to another
securities account maintained in the name of Cash Management Bank and in no case
will any financial asset credited to any of the Collateral Accounts be
registered in the name of Borrower, payable to the order of Borrower or
specially indorsed to Borrower except to the extent the foregoing have been
specially indorsed to Cash Management Bank or in blank. Without limiting
Borrower's obligations under the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall
only establish and maintain the Holding Account with a financial institution
that has executed an agreement substantially in the form of the Account
Agreement or in such other form acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion.

            3.1.4 ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS. The Collateral Accounts shall be Eligible
Accounts. The Collateral Accounts shall be subject to such applicable laws, and
such applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and of any other banking or governmental authority, as may now or
hereafter be in effect. Income and interest accruing on the Collateral Accounts
or any investments held in such accounts shall be periodically added to the
principal amount of such account and shall be held, disbursed and applied in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Account Agreement.

the event funds sufficient for a required transfer are held in an appropriate
Sub-Account and Lender or Cash Management Bank fails to timely make any transfer
from such Sub-Account as contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Lender
shall permit Borrower to have "real time" informational access to the Collection
Account and Holding Account so that Borrower has an opportunity to discern any
shortfall of all amounts required to be paid hereunder.

      (c)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Security Instrument, but subject to Section 7.3, to the extent that Borrower

notice to Borrower, to withdraw from the Holding Account, an amount equal to

                                       66
<PAGE>

the Person(s) entitled thereto.

      (d)   In the event of any prepayment of the Loan by Borrower that is
permitted or required under this Agreement, Lender shall, provided no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, disburse to the Borrower funds from the
Low DSCR Reserve Account representing the same proportion of the total amount
deposited in such accounts immediately prior to such disbursement as the amount
of the Loan prepaid by the Borrower bears to the total Debt outstanding
immediately prior to such Prepayment.

      (e)   Borrower hereby irrevocably directs that all Excess Cash Flow shall

have so directed): (i) to the extent Lender has received a First Mezzanine Loan
Default Notice and until such time as Lender receives a First Mezzanine Loan
Default Revocation Notice, be deposited directly into the First Mezzanine Loan
Deposit Account for application as provided in the First Mezzanine Loan
Agreement, (ii) provided Lender has not received a First Mezzanine Loan Default
Notice but has received a Second Mezzanine Loan Default Notice and until such
time as Lender receives a Second Mezzanine Loan Default Revocation Notice, be
deposited directly in the Second Mezzanine Loan Account, (iii) provided Lender
has not received a First Mezzanine Loan Default Notice, or a Second Mezzanine
Loan Default Notice, but has received a Third Mezzanine Loan Default Notice and
until such time as Lender receives a Third Mezzanine Loan Default Revocation
Notice, be deposited directly in the Third Mezzanine Loan Account, (iv) provided
Lender has not received a First Mezzanine Loan Default Notice, a Second
Mezzanine Loan Default Notice, or a Third Mezzanine Loan Default Notice, but has
received a Fourth Mezzanine Loan Default Notice and until such time as Lender
receives a Fourth Mezzanine Loan Default Revocation Notice, be deposited
directly in the Fourth Mezzanine Loan Account, and (v) provided Lender has not
received a First Mezzanine Loan Default Notice, a Second Mezzanine Loan Default
Notice, a Third Mezzanine Loan Default Notice, or a Fourth Mezzanine Loan
Default Notice, but, if the Fifth Mezzanine Loan has been funded on or before
the Outside Date, and Lender has received a Fifth Mezzanine Loan Default Notice
and until such time as Lender receives a notice from Fifth Mezzanine Lender that
such Event of Default is no longer continuing (a FIFTH MEZZANINE LOAN DEFAULT
REVOCATION NOTICE), be deposited directly in the Fifth Mezzanine Loan Account.
The direction set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not be
changed or terminated without the written consent of each Mezzanine Lender.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary no Mezzanine Loan Default
Notice shall be required for the deposit of Proceeds into the respective
Mezzanine Loan Deposit Account in accordance with the terms of Section 6.2.3
hereof.

            3.1.7 PAYMENTS FROM SUB-ACCOUNTS. Borrower irrevocably authorizes

cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and

contemplated hereby with respect to the Account Collateral (excluding losses on

                                       70

been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms hereof and Lender shall

with any Governmental Authority required for the execution, delivery and
performance by Borrower, Guarantor, Affiliate Tenant, and Borrower Parents of
this Agreement or any other Loan Documents has been obtained and is in full
force and effect.

            4.1.4 LITIGATION. Except as set forth on Schedule I attached hereto,
there are no arbitration proceedings, governmental investigations, actions,
suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before any Governmental Authority
now pending or, to the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, threatened against or
affecting Borrower, Affiliate Tenant, Borrower Subsidiary, Borrower Parents or
the Property (other than (i) personal injury claims which are covered by
insurance and have a claim amount of less than $250,000 and (ii) arbitration
proceedings, governmental investigations, actions, suits or proceedings at law
or in equity which have a claim amount of less than (a) $250,000 with respect to
any individual proceeding and (b) $500,000 in the aggregate of all such

the Property would not have a Material Adverse Effect on any individual Property
or all of the Property. There are no arbitration proceedings, governmental
investigations, actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before
any Governmental Authority now pending or, to the Best of Borrower's Knowledge,
threatened against or affecting Guarantor which, if determined against
Guarantor, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

            4.1.5 AGREEMENTS. None of Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, or
Affiliate Tenant is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any
restriction which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. None
of Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, or Affiliate Tenant is in default in any
respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,
covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is
a party or by which Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, Affiliate Tenant or the
Property is bound, which default is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect. None of Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, or Affiliate Tenant has any
material financial obligation (contingent or otherwise) under any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to
which Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, or Affiliate Tenant is a party or by which
Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, Affiliate Tenant or the Property is otherwise
bound, other than (a) obligations incurred in the ordinary course of the
operation of the Property, including membership programs disclosed in writing to
Lender on or prior to the date hereof, and (b) obligations under the Loan
Documents.

            4.1.6 TITLE. Borrower has good, marketable and insurable fee simple
title (or leasehold title, as applicable, and as disclosed in the Title Report)
to the Land and the Improvements, free and clear of all Liens whatsoever except
the Permitted Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the
Loan Documents and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. Borrower has good
and marketable title to the remainder of the Property, free and clear of all
Liens whatsoever except the Permitted Encumbrances. The Security Instrument,
when properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with any Uniform
Commercial Code financing statements required to be filed in connection
therewith, will create (a) a valid, perfected first mortgage lien on the Land
and the Improvements, subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and (b) perfected
security interests in and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all
personalty (including the Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in
each case subject only to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances. Except as may
be indicated in and insured over by the Title Policy, to the Best of Borrower's
Knowledge, there are no claims for payment for work, labor or materials
affecting the Property which are or may become a lien prior to, or of equal
priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents. Borrower represents and
warrants that none of the Permitted Encumbrances will have a Material Adverse
Effect. Borrower shall preserve its right, title and interest in and to the
Property for so long as the Note remains outstanding and will warrant and defend
same and the validity and priority of the Lien hereof from and against any and
all claims whatsoever other than the Permitted Encumbrances.

            4.1.7 NO BANKRUPTCY FILING. Neither Borrower, Borrower Parents,
Borrower Subsidiary, Affiliate Tenant, nor Guarantor is contemplating either the
filing of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency
laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of such entity's assets or
property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing
of any such petition against it or against Borrower Parents, Borrower
Subsidiary, Affiliate Tenant, or Guarantor.

            4.1.8 FULL AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE. To the Best of Borrower's
Knowledge, no statement of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any of
the other Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements contained herein
or therein not misleading. There is no fact presently known to Borrower which
has not been disclosed which has a Material Adverse Effect, or to the Best of
Borrower's Knowledge could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

            4.1.9 ALL PROPERTY The Property constitutes all of the real
property, personal property, equipment and fixtures currently (i) owned, leased

that is under common control with Borrower within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA (each, an ERISA AFFILIATE) (each, a PLAN) or any plan that

meaning of ERISA Section 3(37); and (ii) has made and shall continue to make
when due all required contributions to all such Plans (other than Plans relating
to ERISA Affiliates), if any, where the failure to so contribute is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Plan (other than Plans
relating to ERISA Affiliates), if any, has been and will be administered in
material compliance with its terms and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Internal Revenue Code, and any other applicable federal or state law; and no
action shall be taken or fail to be taken that would result in the
disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of any such Plan intended to be
qualified and/or tax exempt; and

      (b)   With respect to any "multiemployer plan," (i) Borrower has not,

and 4205 of ERISA which withdrawal is reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

      (c)   Borrower is not an employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, whether or not subject to Title I of ERISA, none of the assets of
Borrower constitutes or will constitute plan assets of one or more such plans
within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 and transactions by or with
Borrower are not subject to similar laws regulating investment of,

                                       74

Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code currently in effect (SIMILAR
LAWS), which prohibit or otherwise restrict the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Borrower and the Property and the use thereof comply in all material respects
with all applicable Legal Requirements, including, without limitation, building
and zoning ordinances and codes except where the failure to so comply is not
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the matters
set forth on attached Schedule XII would have a Material Adverse Effect on any
individual Property or all of the Property. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge,
none of Borrower, Affiliate Tenant, or Borrower Subsidiary is in default or in
violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental
Authority. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, other than as set forth in

under any of the Loan Documents.

            4.1.12 FINANCIAL INFORMATION. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge,

Property as of the date of such reports, and (iii) to the extent prepared or
audited by an independent certified public accounting firm, have been prepared

Parents have any material contingent liabilities, liabilities for delinquent
taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or anticipated
losses from any unfavorable commitments that, to the Best of Borrower's
Knowledge, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
except as referred to or reflected in said financial statements and operating

Best of Borrower's Knowledge, is contemplated with respect to all or any portion
of the Property.

            4.1.14 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS. None of the proceeds of the Loan
will be used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as
defined in Regulation U, Regulation X or Regulation T or for the purpose of
reducing or retiring any Indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase
or carry "margin stock" or for any other purpose which might constitute this
transaction a "purpose credit" within the meaning of Regulation U or Regulation
X. As of the Closing Date, Borrower does not own any "margin stock."

right-of-way abutting the Property (which are connected so as to serve the
Property without passing over other property) or in recorded easements serving

purposes have been completed and, if necessary, dedicated to public use.

otherwise affecting the Property, nor are there any contemplated improvements to
the Property that may result in such special or other assessments.

            4.1.19 ENFORCEABILITY. The Loan Documents are not subject to any
existing right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by Borrower,
including the defense of usury, nor would the operation of any of the terms of
the Loan Documents, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Loan
Documents unenforceable (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and
similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally, and subject as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)), and Borrower has
not asserted any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense with
respect thereto.

            4.1.20 NO PRIOR ASSIGNMENT. There are no prior sales, transfers or
assignments of the Leases or any portion of the Rents due and payable or to
become due and payable which are presently outstanding following the funding of
the Loan, other than those being terminated or assigned to Lender concurrently
herewith.

            4.1.21 INSURANCE. Borrower has obtained and has delivered to Lender
certified copies or certificates of all insurance policies required under this
Agreement, reflecting the insurance coverages, amounts and other requirements

full force and effect and in compliance with all Legal Requirements except where
the failure to have any such License is not reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Borrower shall keep and maintain all Licenses necessary
for

                                       76
<PAGE>

the operation of the Property for hotel purposes. The use being made of the

            4.1.25 PHYSICAL CONDITION. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge and

including, without limitation, all buildings, Improvements, parking facilities,
sidewalks, storm drainage systems, roofs, plumbing systems, HVAC systems, fire
protection systems, electrical systems, equipment, elevators, exterior sidings
and doors, landscaping, irrigation systems and all structural components, are in
good condition, order and repair in all material respects; to the Best of
Borrower's Knowledge and except as disclosed in the Physical Conditions Report,
there exists no structural or other material defects or damages in or to the
Property, whether latent or otherwise, and Borrower has not received any written
notice from any insurance company or bonding company of any defects or
inadequacies in the Property, or any part thereof, which would adversely affect
the insurability of the same or cause the imposition of extraordinary premiums
or charges thereon or of any termination or threatened termination of any policy
of insurance or bond.

            4.1.26 BOUNDARIES. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge and except as
disclosed on the Survey, all of the Improvements lie wholly within the
boundaries and building restriction lines of the Real Property, and no
improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Real Property, and no
easements or other encumbrances upon the Real Property encroach upon any of the
Improvements, so as to have a Material Adverse Effect on the value or
marketability of the Real Property except those which are insured against by the
Title Policy.

            4.1.27 LEASES. The Property is not subject to any Material Leases
other than the Affiliate Leases and the Leases described in the certified rent
roll delivered in connection with the origination of the Loan. To the Best of
Borrower's Knowledge (which shall include Borrower's consultation with Manager),
such certified rent roll is true, complete and correct in all material respects
as of the date set forth therein. Except as described in the Ground Leases, no
Person has any possessory interest in the Property or right to occupy the same
(other than typical short-term occupancy rights of hotel guests which are not
the subject of a written agreement) except under and pursuant to the provisions
of the Leases. To the Best

                                       77
<PAGE>

of Borrower's Knowledge, the current Leases are in full force and effect and
there are no material defaults thereunder by either party (other than as
expressly disclosed on the certified rent roll delivered to Lender or the Tenant
estoppel certificates delivered to Lender in connection with the closing of the
Loan) and there are no conditions that, with the passage of time or the giving
of notice, or both, would constitute material defaults thereunder. To the Best
of Borrower's Knowledge, all construction and other obligations of a material
nature to be performed by the Borrower under the Leases have been satisfied and)
any required payments by Borrower to the Tenants under the Leases for tenant
improvements have been made to the extent required to be satisfied. To the Best
of Borrower's Knowledge, no Tenant under any Lease is entitled to any offsets,
abatements, deductions against the Rent payable under any Lease from and after
the date hereof. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, the Rent has been paid
current under the Leases. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, no Rent has been
paid more than one (1) month in advance of its due date, except as disclosed in
the Tenant estoppel certificates delivered to Lender in connection with the
closing of the Loan. There has been no prior sale, transfer or assignment,
hypothecation or pledge by Borrower of any Lease or of the Rents received
therein, which will be outstanding following the funding of the Loan, other than
those being assigned to Lender concurrently herewith. No Tenant or other Person
under any Lease or other agreement has any right or option pursuant to such
Lease or other agreement or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
Property (except with respect to the options in the PGA Agreements which are
fully insured over by the Title Policy). Lender hereby agrees that on the date
Borrower delivers to Lender a "clean" tenant estoppel certificate in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit G regarding any Lease for which Borrower has not
delivered a tenant estoppel certificate to Lender on the date hereof (each such
Lease, a CERTIFYING LEASE), Borrower's representations in this Section 4.1.27
with respect to such Certifying Lease shall automatically expire.

            4.1.28 FILING AND RECORDING TAXES. All transfer taxes, deed stamps,
intangible taxes or other amounts in the nature of transfer taxes required to be
paid by any Person under applicable Legal Requirements currently in effect in
connection with the transfer of the Property to Borrower have been paid and the
granting and recording of the Security Instrument and the UCC financing
statements required to be filed in connection with the Loan. All mortgage,
mortgage recording, stamp, intangible or other similar tax required to be paid
by any Person under applicable Legal Requirements currently in effect in
connection with the execution, delivery, recordation, filing, registration,
perfection or enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, the Security Instrument, have been paid, and, under current Legal
Requirements, the Security Instrument is enforceable against Borrower in
accordance with its terms by Lender (or any subsequent holder thereof) subject
only to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting rights of
creditors generally, and subject as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or
at law).

            4.1.29 SINGLE PURPOSE ENTITY/SEPARATENESS.

      (a)   Borrower hereby represents, warrants and covenants that each of
Borrower and Borrower Subsidiary is, and, except as set forth on Schedule X, has
been since the date of its formation, a Single Purpose Entity.

      (b)   All of the assumptions made in the Non-Consolidation Opinion,
including, but not limited to, any exhibits attached thereto and any
certificates delivered by Borrower in connection with the issuance of the
Non-Consolidation Opinion, are true and correct in all respects and any
assumptions made in any subsequent non-consolidation opinion delivered in
connection with the Loan Documents (an ADDITIONAL NON-CONSOLIDATION OPINION),
including, but not limited to, any exhibits attached thereto, are true and
correct in all material respects. Borrower has complied with all of the
assumptions made with respect to it in the Non-Consolidation Opinion. To the
Best of Borrower's Knowledge, each entity other than Borrower with respect to
which an assumption shall be made in any Additional Non-Consolidation Opinion
will have complied and will comply with all of the assumptions made with respect
to it in any Additional Non-Consolidation Opinion.

            4.1.30 MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. The Management Agreement is in full
force and effect and there is no default thereunder by any party thereto and no

would constitute a default thereunder. The Manager is not an Affiliate of
Borrower.

            4.1.31 ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. No portion of the Property has been or will
be purchased with proceeds of any illegal activity.

            4.1.32 BORROWER AND BORROWER SUBSIDIARIES SPE COMPLIANCE. Each
Borrower represents on behalf of itself and on behalf of each Borrower
Subsidiary that Borrower Subsidiary and Borrower (i) is and always has been duly
formed, validly existing, and in good standing in the state of its incorporation
or organization and in all other jurisdictions where it is qualified to do
business, (ii) is a Single Purpose Entity, (iii) has no judgements or liens of
any nature against it except for tax liens not yet due, (iv) is in compliance in
all material respects with all laws, regulations, and orders applicable to it
and has received all permits necessary for it to operate, (v) is not involved in
any dispute with any taxing authority, (vi) has paid all taxes prior to
delinquency, (vii) except as disclosed on Schedule I, is not now a party to any
lawsuit, arbitration, summons or legal proceeding, (viii) has provided Lender
with complete financial statements that reflect a fair and accurate view of the
entity's financial condition, (ix) has with respect to the Non-consolidation
Opinion delivered on the date hereof materially complied with the separateness
covenants referred to therein since its formation (with any deviations in such
compliance specifically addressed and analyzed in such opinion) and (x) has no
material contingent or actual obligations unrelated to the Property, other than
as specifically addressed and analyzed in the Non-Consolidation Opinion.

            4.1.33 TAX FILINGS. Borrower has filed (or has obtained effective
extensions for filing) all federal, state and local tax returns required to be
filed and has paid or made adequate provision for the payment of all federal,
state and local taxes, charges and assessments payable by Borrower.

            4.1.34 SOLVENCY/FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE. Borrower (a) has not entered
into the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any Loan Document with
the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor and (b) has received
reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under the Loan
Documents. After giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of
Borrower's assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of the
Loan, exceed Borrower's total liabilities, including, without limitation,
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. The fair
saleable value of Borrower's assets is and will, immediately following the
making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's probable liabilities, including
the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities on its Debts as such Debts
become absolute and matured. Borrower's assets do not and, immediately following
the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry
out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not
intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur Debt and liabilities
(including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to
pay such Debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing and
amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or
in respect of obligations of Borrower).

Schedule XI, neither Borrower nor Manager (i) is involved in or, to the Best of
Borrower's Knowledge, threatened with any material labor dispute, material
grievance or litigation relating to labor matters involving any employees and
other laborers at the Property, including, without limitation, violation of any
federal, state or local labor, safety or employment laws (domestic or foreign)

any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act or the Railway Labor Act or (iii) is a party to, or bound by, any collective
bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to employees and other
laborers at the Property. To the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, except as set
forth on attached Schedule XI, no union claims to represent the employees and
other laborers at the Property. Except as set forth on attached Schedule XI,

union organizing activities among the employees and other laborers at the

determined against Borrower or Guarantor have a Material Adverse Effect on any
individual Property or all of the Property (except this representation shall not
apply to the Claremont Property). With respect to the Claremont Property, none
of the matters set forth on attached Schedule XI are, if determined against
Borrower or Guarantor, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
such Property.

            4.1.38 BROKERS. Neither Borrower nor, to the Best of Borrower's

Knowledge, Lender has dealt with any broker or finder with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and neither party has done any
acts, had any negotiations or conversations, or made any agreements or promises
which will in any way create or give rise to any obligation or liability for the
payment by either party of any brokerage fee, charge, commission or other
compensation to any Person with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Loan Documents. Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall pay as and when due
any and all brokerage fees, charges, commissions or other compensation or
reimbursement due to any broker of Borrower with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents. Borrower and Lender shall each indemnify and
hold harmless the other from and against any loss, liability, cost or expense,
including any judgments, attorneys' fees, or costs of appeal, incurred by the
other party and arising out of or relating to any claim for brokerage
commissions or finder's fees alleged to be due as a result of the indemnifying

survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and the payment of the
Indebtedness.

as any amount remains owing to Lender under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents by Borrower or Guarantor unless a longer survival period is
expressly stated in a Loan Document with respect to a specific representation or
warranty, in which case, for such longer period. All representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made in this Agreement or in the other Loan
Documents by Borrower shall be deemed to have been relied upon by Lender

its behalf.

V.    BORROWER COVENANTS

      SECTION 5.1 AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

            From the Closing Date and until payment and performance in full of
all obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents, Borrower hereby covenants
and agrees with Lender that:

            5.1.1 PERFORMANCE BY BORROWER. Borrower shall observe, perform and
fulfill each and every covenant, term and provision of each Loan Document
executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower, in accordance with the
provisions of each Loan Document, and shall not enter into or otherwise suffer
or permit any amendment, waiver, supplement, termination or other modification
of any Loan Document executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower, as
applicable, without the prior written consent of Lender.

            5.1.2 EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS; INSURANCE.
Subject to Borrower's right of contest pursuant to Section 7.3, CNL Grand Wailea

Settlement Agreement, General Release and Waiver of Claims dated as of August 7,
1998 and each Borrower shall comply and cause the Property to be in compliance
with all Legal Requirements applicable to the Borrower, Manager and the Property
and the uses permitted upon the Property. Borrower shall do or cause to be done
all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its
existence, rights, licenses, permits and franchises necessary to comply with all
Legal Requirements applicable to it

                                       82
<PAGE>

and the Property. There shall never be committed by Borrower, and Borrower shall
not knowingly permit any other Person in occupancy of or involved with the
operation or use of the Property to commit, any act or omission affording the
federal government or any state or local government the right of forfeiture as
against the Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of
Borrower's obligations under any of the Loan Documents. Borrower hereby
covenants and agrees not to commit, knowingly permit or suffer to exist any act
or omission affording such right of forfeiture. Borrower shall at all times
maintain, preserve and protect all franchises and trade names and preserve all
the remainder of its property used in the conduct of its business and shall keep
the Property in good working order and repair, and from time to time make, or
cause to be made, all reasonably necessary repairs, renewals, replacements,
betterments and improvements thereto, all as more fully set forth in the
Security Instrument. Borrower shall keep the Property insured at all times to
such extent and against such risks, and maintain liability and such other
insurance, as is more fully set forth in this Agreement. Without limiting
Borrower's obligations hereunder with respect to the Doral Settlement Agreement,
Borrower will use commercially reasonable efforts to cure the zoning matters set
forth on attached Schedule XII.

            5.1.3 LITIGATION. Borrower shall give prompt written notice to
Lender of any litigation or governmental proceedings pending or threatened in
writing against Borrower which, if determined adversely to Borrower, would have
a Material Adverse Effect.

            5.1.4 SINGLE PURPOSE ENTITY.

      (a)   Each of Borrower, Borrower Parents, Borrower Subsidiary, and
Affiliate Tenant is and shall remain a Single Purpose Entity, and Borrower shall
cause each Borrower Subsidiary to be and to remain, a Single Purpose Entity.

      (b)   Except as required by the Loan Documents, Borrower, Affiliate
Tenant, Borrower Parents and Borrower Subsidiary shall continue to maintain, and
to cause Borrower Subsidiary to continue to maintain its own deposit account or

institutions. Except as required by the Loan Documents, none of the funds of
either Borrower or Borrower Subsidiary will be commingled with the funds of any
other Affiliate.

      (c)   To the extent that either Borrower or Borrower Subsidiary shares the
same officers or other employees as any of its Affiliates, the salaries of and
the expenses related to providing benefits to such officers and other employees
shall be fairly allocated among such entities, and each such entity shall bear
its fair share of the salary and benefit costs associated with all such common
officers and employees.

      (d)   To the extent that Borrower, Borrower Parents, Affiliate Tenant, or
Borrower Subsidiary jointly contracts with any of its Affiliates to do business
with vendors or service providers or to share overhead expenses, the costs
incurred in so doing shall be allocated fairly among such entities, and each
such entity shall bear its fair share of such costs. To the extent that
Borrower, Borrower Parents, Affiliate Tenant, or Borrower Subsidiary contracts
or does business with vendors or service providers where the goods and services
provided are partially for the benefit of any other Person, the costs incurred
in so doing shall be fairly allocated to or

                                       83
<PAGE>

among such entities for whose benefit the goods and services are provided, and
each such entity shall bear its fair share of such costs. All material
transactions between (or among) Borrower, Borrower Parents, Affiliate Tenant, or
Borrower Subsidiary and any of their Affiliates shall be conducted on
substantially the same terms (or on more favorable terms for Borrower) as would
be conducted with third parties.

      (e)   To the extent that Borrower, Borrower Parents, Affiliate Tenant, or
Borrower Subsidiary or any of its Affiliates have offices in the same location,
there shall be a fair and appropriate allocation of overhead costs among them,
and each such entity shall bear its fair share of such expenses.

      (f)   Borrower, Borrower Parents, Affiliate Tenant, or Borrower Subsidiary
shall conduct its affairs and shall cause Borrower Subsidiary to conduct its
affairs strictly in accordance with its organizational documents, and observe
all necessary, appropriate and customary corporate, limited liability company or
partnership formalities, as applicable, including, but not limited to, obtaining
any and all consents necessary to authorize actions taken or to be taken, and
maintaining accurate and separate books, records and accounts, including,
without limitation, payroll and intercompany transaction accounts.

      (g)   In addition, Borrower, Borrower Parents, Affiliate Tenant, and
Borrower Subsidiary Borrower shall, and Borrower shall cause Borrower Subsidiary
to: (i) maintain books and records separate from those of any other Person; (ii)
maintain its assets in such a manner that it is not more costly or difficult to
segregate, identify or ascertain such assets; (iii) hold regular meetings of its
board of directors, shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and

case may be, formalities; (iv) hold itself out to creditors and the public as a
legal entity separate and distinct from any other entity; (v) prepare separate

            5.1.5 CONSENTS. If Borrower is a corporation, the board of directors
of such Person may not take any action requiring the unanimous affirmative vote
of 100% of the members of the board of directors unless all of the directors,
including the Independent Directors, shall have participated in such vote. If
Borrower is a limited liability company, (a) if such Person is managed by a
board of managers, the board of managers of such Person may not take any action
requiring the unanimous affirmative vote of 100% of the members of the board of
managers unless all of the managers, including the Independent Managers, shall
have participated in such vote, (b) if such Person is not managed by a board of
managers, the members of such Person may not take any action requiring the
affirmative vote of 100% of the members of such Person unless all of the
members, including the Independent Members, shall have participated in such
vote. An affirmative vote of 100% of the directors, board of managers or

or insolvency petition or otherwise institute insolvency proceedings or to
authorize Borrower to do so or (ii) file an involuntary bankruptcy petition
against any Close Affiliate, Manager, or any Close

                                       84
<PAGE>

Affiliate of Manager. Furthermore, Borrower's formation documents shall
expressly state that for so long as the Loan is outstanding, Borrower shall not
be permitted to (i) dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge or sell all or
substantially all of Borrower's assets other than in connection with the
repayment of the Loan, or (ii) engage in any other business activity, and such
restrictions shall not be modified or violated for so long as the Loan is
outstanding.

            5.1.6 ACCESS TO PROPERTY. Borrower and Affiliate Tenant shall permit

            5.1.8 COOPERATE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary,
and Affiliate Tenant shall cooperate fully with Lender with respect to any
proceedings before any court, board or other Governmental Authority which would
reasonably be expected to affect in any material adverse way the rights of
Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents and, in connection
therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in any such
proceedings which may have a Material Adverse Effect.

            5.1.9 PERFORM LOAN DOCUMENTS. Borrower shall observe, perform and
satisfy all the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of, and shall pay

incurred in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) out of such Proceeds.

      (b)   Borrower, Affiliate Tenant, and Borrower Subsidiary shall comply
with all Insurance Requirements and shall not bring or keep or permit to be
brought or kept any article upon any of the Property or cause or permit any
condition to exist thereon which would be prohibited by any Insurance

maintained by Borrower on or with respect to any part of the Property pursuant
to Section 6.1.

            5.1.11 FURTHER ASSURANCES; SEPARATE NOTES.

      (a)   Borrower shall, at its cost and expense (subject to the limitations
set forth in Article XIV), execute and acknowledge (or cause to be executed and
acknowledged) and deliver to Lender all documents, and take all actions,
reasonably required by Lender from time to time to confirm the rights created or
now or hereafter intended to be created under this Agreement and the other

                                       85
<PAGE>

Loan Documents and any security interest created or purported to be created
thereunder, to protect and further the validity, priority and enforceability of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to subject to the Loan Documents
any property of Borrower intended by the terms of any one or more of the Loan
Documents to be encumbered by the Loan Documents, or otherwise carry out the
purposes of the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereunder.
Borrower agrees that it shall, upon request, reasonably cooperate with Lender in
connection with any request by Lender to sever the Note into two (2) or more
separate substitute or component notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to
the Principal Amount and to reapportion the Loan among such separate substitute
notes, including, without limitation, by executing and delivering to Lender new
substitute or component notes to replace the Note, amendments to or replacements
of existing Loan Documents to reflect such severance and/or Opinions of Counsel
with respect to such substitute or component notes, amendments and/or
replacements, and the holders of such substitute or component notes shall
designate a lead lender or agent for such holders to whom Borrower may direct
all communications with respect to the Loan. Any such substitute or component
notes may have varying principal amounts and economic terms, provided, however,
that (i) the maturity date of any such substitute or component notes shall be
the same as the scheduled Maturity Date of the Note immediately prior to the
issuance of such substitute notes, (ii) the substitute notes shall bear interest
at a fixed rate of interest; (iii) the initial weighted average interest rates
for the term of the substitute notes shall not exceed the interest rate under
the Note immediately prior to the issuance of such substitute notes; and (iv)
the economics of the Loan, taken as a whole, shall not change in a manner which
is adverse to Borrower. Borrower acknowledges that in connection with a
Securitization, the Note will be surrendered by Borrower to Lender and Borrower
will be required to enter into new substitute replacement notes which,
preliminarily, may consist of multiple pari passu and/or sequential classes of
notes and may also include interest only classes of notes (class "X") (although
Borrowers hereby acknowledge that such classes are not final and that Lender may
structure such classes in its sole and absolute discretion provided such
structure is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement). Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a material Event of Default (as
determined by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion), Lender may apply
payment of all sums due under such substitute notes in such order and priority
as Lender shall elect in its sole and absolute discretion.

      (b)   Borrower further agrees that if, in connection with the
Securitization, it is determined by the Rating Agencies that a portion of the
Securitization would not receive an "investment grade" rating unless the
principal amount of the Loan were to be decreased and, as a result, the
principal amount of the Loan is decreased, then (i) the Borrower shall take all
actions as are necessary to effect the "resizing" of the Mezzanine Loans and the
Loan, including any new mezzanine loans that Lender requires Borrower to enter
into (provided the documents evidencing and securing such new loan(s) are
substantially identical in form and substance to the Mezzanine Loan Documents
(and shall have the same lockout and prepayment restrictions as the Loan), (ii)
the Borrower shall cause the Mezzanine Borrowers to comply with its agreements
to effect a "resizing", and (iii) Lender shall on the date of the "resizing" of
the Loan lend to the respective Mezzanine Borrowers (by way of a repayment of
the principal amount of the Loan and the Mezzanine Loans) such additional amount
equal to the amount of the principal reduction of the Loan (in which case the
Liquidated Damages Amount shall be inapplicable to such repayment), provided,
Borrower and Mezzanine Borrowers shall execute and deliver any and all necessary
amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents and the Mezzanine Loan
Documents. In addition, Borrower and Lender agree that if, in connection with
the Securitization, it is determined by the Rating Agencies that, if the
principal amount of the Mezzanine Loan were to

                                       86
<PAGE>
be decreased and, as a result the principal amount of the Loan were increased,
more "investment grade" rated securities could be issued, then (i) if "resizing"
to decrease the size of the Mezzanine Loans and increase the size of the Loan is
provided for in the Mezzanine Loan Documents, each of them shall take all
actions provided for in the documentation for the Loan as are necessary to
effect the "resizing" of the Loan and the Mezzanine Loans, (ii) Borrower shall
cause the Mezzanine Borrowers to comply with its agreements to effect a
"resizing" and (iii) Lender shall on the date of the "resizing" of the Loan lend
to the Borrower (by way of a reallocation of the principal amount of the Loan
and the Mezzanine Loans) an additional amount equal to the amount of principal
reduction of the Mezzanine Loans, provided that Borrower and Mezzanine Borrowers
execute and deliver any and all necessary modifications to the Loan Documents
and Mezzanine Loan Documents, including, without limitation, loan agreements,
pledge agreements and guarantees. In connection with the foregoing, Borrower
agrees to execute and deliver such documents and other agreements reasonably
required by any Mezzanine Lender and/or Lender to "re-size" the Loan and the
Mezzanine Loans, including, without limitation, an amendment to this Agreement,
the Note, the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents and, if the
principal amount of the Loan is increased, an endorsement to the Title Policy
reflecting an increase in the insured amount thereunder and confirmation that
Borrower has paid additional mortgage recording taxes as may be applicable. In
addition, at Lender's election, Borrower agrees to reimburse Lender for all
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) incurred by Lender in connection with any "resizing" of the Loan
and to pay for any "Eagle 9" or other UCC insurance reasonably required by
Lender in connection therewith and deliver opinions of counsel similar to those
delivered on the date hereof with respect to Mezzanine Borrowers and the
Mezzanine Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender agrees that any
"resizing" of the Loan and the Mezzanine Loans shall not change the economics of
the Loan and the Mezzanine Loans taken as a whole in a manner which is adverse
to Borrower (except any increase in the weighted average interest rate of the
Notes that may result if certain prepayments of the Loan are made in accordance
with the terms hereof after and which are unrelated to any such "resizing").

      (c)   In addition to the foregoing, in connection with creating substitute
or component notes, Lender shall have the right, without otherwise increasing or
reducing the aggregate amount of interest payable by the Borrower hereunder, to
(i) create one or more component notes representing so-called "interest strips,"
that do not have a stated principal balance but represent an entitlement to
certain interest (or Default Rate interest) payments that may be payable by the
Borrower and (ii) reapportion the interest payable by the Borrower following the
Maturity Date, such that a portion of interest at the Applicable Rate and/or
Default Rate interest is applied first in reduction of the principal balance of
the Loan or paid into a deferred interest reserve account. Additionally, such
component notes may provide that Default Rate interest is used to repay Servicer
advances and interest thereon.

      (d)   In addition, Borrower shall, at Borrower's sole cost and expense:

            (i)   furnish to Lender, to the extent not otherwise already
furnished to Lender and reasonably acceptable to Lender, all instruments,
documents, boundary surveys, footing or foundation surveys, certificates, plans
and specifications, appraisals, title and other insurance reports and
agreements, and each and every other document, certificate, agreement and
instrument required to be furnished by Borrower pursuant to the terms of the
Loan Documents;

                                       87
<PAGE>

            (ii)  execute and deliver, from time to time, such further
instruments (including, without limitation, delivery of any financing statements
under the UCC) as may be reasonably requested by Lender to confirm the Lien of
the Security Instrument on any Building Equipment, Operating Asset or any
Intangible;

            (iii) execute and deliver to Lender such documents, instruments,
certificates, assignments and other writings, and do such other acts necessary
to evidence, preserve and/or protect the collateral at any time securing or
intended to secure the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents, as
Lender may reasonably require;

            (iv)  do and execute all and such further lawful and reasonable
acts, conveyances and assurances for the carrying out of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as Lender shall
reasonably require from time to time; and

            (v)   cause its New York counsel to re-issue the New York opinion
delivered on the date hereof (in identical form and without updating) in favor
of a trustee in a Securitization if such trustee is different that the trustee
currently listed in such opinion.

            5.1.12 MORTGAGE TAXES. Borrower shall pay all taxes, charges,
filing, registration and recording fees, excises and levies payable with respect
to the Note or the Liens created or secured by the Loan Documents, other than
income, franchise and doing business taxes imposed on Lender. Lender agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the taxes and fees paid to the
State of Florida following the Closing Date in connection with any transactions
contemplated by Section 5.1.11 and Article XIV.

            5.1.13 OPERATION. Borrower and Affiliate Tenant shall (i) promptly
perform and/or observe all of the covenants and agreements required to be
performed and observed by it under the Management Agreement and do all things
necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights thereunder;
(ii) promptly notify Lender of any "event of default" under the Management
Agreement of which it is aware; (iii) enforce in a commercially reasonable
manner the performance and observance of all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed and/or observed by the Manager under the Management
Agreement.

            5.1.14 BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. Borrower, Borrower Subsidiary, and
Affiliate Tenant shall continue to engage in the businesses presently conducted
by it as and to the extent the same are necessary for the ownership,
maintenance, management and operation of the Property. Borrower shall qualify to
do business and shall remain in good standing under the laws of the State in
which the Property is located and as and to the extent required for the
ownership, maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

            5.1.15 TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. Borrower shall warrant and defend (a)
its title to the Property and every part thereof, subject only to Liens
permitted hereunder (including Permitted Encumbrances) and (b) the validity and
priority of the Liens of the Security Instrument, the Assignment of Leases and
this Agreement on the Property, subject only to Liens permitted hereunder
(including Permitted Encumbrances), in each case against the claims of all
Persons whomsoever. Borrower shall reimburse Lender for any losses, costs,
damages or expenses

                                       88
<PAGE>

(including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by Lender if an
interest in the Property, other than as permitted hereunder, is claimed by
another Person.

            5.1.16 COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT. In the event (a) that this Agreement or
the Security Instrument is foreclosed upon in whole or in part or that this
Agreement or the Security Instrument is put into the hands of an attorney for
collection, suit, action or foreclosure, (b) of the foreclosure of any security
agreement prior to or subsequent to this Agreement in which proceeding Lender is
made a party, or a mortgage prior to or subsequent to the Security Instrument in
which proceeding Lender is made a party, or (c) of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
rehabilitation or other similar proceeding in respect of Borrower or any of its
constituent Persons or an assignment by Borrower or any of its constituent
Persons for the benefit of its creditors, Borrower, its successors or assigns,
shall be chargeable with and agrees to pay all costs of collection and defense,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by Lender or Borrower
in connection therewith and in connection with any appellate proceeding or
post-judgment action involved therein, together with all required service or use
taxes.

            5.1.17 ESTOPPEL STATEMENT.

      (a)   Borrower shall, from time to time, upon thirty (30) days' prior
written request from Lender, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Lender, an

such certificates more frequently than one time in any calendar year; provided,
however, that there shall be no limit on the number of times Borrower may be
required to obtain such certificates if an Event of Default hereunder or under
any of the Loan Documents has occurred and is continuing.

notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period; and
(D) which contains an extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides
that after the physical loss to the Improvements and Personal Property has been

                                       95
<PAGE>

income either returns to the same level it was at prior to the loss, or the
expiration of twelve (12) months from the date that such Property is repaired or
replaced and operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding
that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period. The amount of such
loss of rents or business income insurance, as applicable, shall be determined
prior to the date hereof and at least once each year thereafter based on
Borrower's reasonable estimate of the gross income from the Properties for the
succeeding period of coverage required above. All proceeds payable to Lender or
Borrower pursuant to this subsection and shall be applied to the Obligations;
provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve
Borrower of its obligations to pay the Obligations when due except to the extent

individuals or interests as contemplated by the Foreign Terrorism Insurance Act
is either (i) commercially available, (ii) commonly obtained by owners of
commercial properties in the same geographic area as the Property and which are
similar to the Property or (iii) maintained for another hotel property in the
same geographic area as the Property which is at least 51% owned directly or
indirectly by Guarantor, Borrower shall be required to carry Terrorism Insurance
throughout the term of the Loan (including any extension terms) on a per
occurrence basis in an amount equal to the Terrorism Insurance Amount. The
TERRORISM INSURANCE AMOUNT shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (i) 100% of
the full replacement cost inclusive of furniture, fixtures and equipment (but

reasonable types of insurance not covered in Sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.10 and
in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time to time may reasonably require
against such other insurable hazards which at the time are commonly insured
against for property similar to the Property located in or around the region in
which the Property is located and as may be reasonably required to protect
Lender's interests. Borrower must maintain California earthquake insurance in an
amount not to exceed $125,000,000 per occurrence (with a maximum deductible of
5% of the total insurance value per unit of insurance, including business
income) and it is agreed that the La Quinta Property and the Claremont Property
are included in this insurance; provided, that if additional properties are
acquired and added to any blanket coverage, Lender shall have the right to
approve such values and request additional coverage.

            6.1.12 RATINGS OF INSURERS. Borrower shall maintain insurance
coverage with one or more primary insurers reasonably acceptable to Lender,

its equivalent by the other Rating Agencies) in the case of insurance coverage
required under Sections 6.1.2, 6.1.3 and 6.1.5 through 6.1.12 (provided,
however, any earthquake insurance required hereunder may be provided by insurers
with lower claims paying ratings). All insurers providing insurance required by
this Agreement shall be authorized to issue insurance in the applicable State.

            6.1.13 FORM OF INSURANCE POLICIES; ENDORSEMENTS. All policies (i)
shall name Lender and its successors and/or assigns as their interest may appear
as an additional insured or as a loss payee, shall provide that all Proceeds
(except with respect to Proceeds of general liability and workers' compensation
insurance) be payable to Lender as and to the extent set forth in Section 6.2;
(ii) shall contain a Non-Contributory Standard Lender Clause and, except with
respect to general liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance, a
Lender's Loss Payable Endorsement, or their equivalents; (iii) shall include
effective waivers by the insurer of all claims for insurance premiums against
all loss payees, additional insureds and named insureds (other than Borrower)
and all rights of subrogation against any loss payee, additional insured or
named insured; (iv) shall be assigned to Lender; (v) except as otherwise
provided above, shall be subject to a deductible, if any, not greater in any
material respect than the deductible for such coverage on the date hereof; (vi)

to protect its interest, including endorsements providing that neither

                                       97
<PAGE>

Borrower, Lender nor any other party shall be a Contributor-insurer (except
deductibles) under said Policies and that no material modification, reduction,
cancellation or termination in amount of, or material change (other than an
increase) in, coverage of any of the Policies shall be effective until at least
thirty (30) days after receipt by each named insured, additional insured and
loss payee of written notice thereof or ten (10) days after receipt of such
notice with respect to nonpayment of premium; (vii) shall permit Lender to pay
the premiums and continue any insurance upon failure of Borrower to pay premiums
when due, upon the insolvency of Borrower or through foreclosure or other
transfer of title to the Property (it being understood that Borrower's rights to
coverage under such policies may not be assignable without the consent of the
insurer); and (viii) shall provide that any proceeds shall be payable to Lender
and Borrower as their interests may appear and that the insurance shall not be
impaired or invalidated by virtue of (A) any act, failure to act, negligence of,
or violation of declarations, warranties or conditions contained in such policy
by the Borrower, Lender or any other named insured, additional insured or loss
payee, except for the willful misconduct of Lender knowingly in violation of the
conditions of such policy, (B) the occupation, use, operation or maintenance of
the Property for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of the
Policy, (C) any foreclosure or other proceeding or notice of sale relating to
the Property, or (D) any change in the possession of the Property without a
change in the identity of the holder of actual title to the Property (provided
that with respect to items (C) and (D), any notice requirements of the
applicable Policies are satisfied).

            6.1.14 PREMIUMS; CERTIFICATES; RENEWALS.

      (a) Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid the premiums for such Policies
(the INSURANCE PREMIUMS) as the same become due and payable and shall furnish to
Lender the receipts for the payment of the Insurance Premiums or other evidence
of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender (provided, however, that
Borrower is not required to furnish such evidence of payment to Lender if such
Insurance Premiums are to be paid by Lender pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement). Within thirty (30) days after request by Lender, Borrower shall
obtain such increases in the amounts of coverage required hereunder as may be
reasonably requested in writing by Lender or as may be requested in writing by
the Rating Agencies (except with respect to the Terrorism Insurance and
earthquake insurance required hereunder), taking into consideration changes in
liability laws, changes in prudent customs and practices, and the like. In the
event Borrower satisfies the requirements under this Section 6.1.14 through the
use of a Policy covering properties in addition to the Property, then (unless
such policy is provided in substantially the same manner as it is as of the date
hereof), Borrower shall provide evidence satisfactory to Lender that the
Insurance Premiums for the Property are separately allocated under such Policy
to the Property and that payment of such allocated amount (A) shall maintain the
effectiveness of such Policy as to the Property and (B) shall otherwise provide
the same protection as would a separate policy that complies with the terms of
this Agreement as to the Property, notwithstanding the failure of payment of any
other portion of the insurance premiums. If no such allocation is available,
Lender shall have the right to increase the amount required to be deposited into
the Insurance Reserve Account in an amount sufficient to purchase a nonblanket
Policy covering the Property from insurance companies which qualify under this
Agreement.

                                       98
<PAGE>

      (b) Borrower shall deliver to Lender on or prior to the Closing Date
certificates setting forth in reasonable detail the material terms (including
any applicable notice requirements) of all Policies from the respective
insurance companies (or their authorized agents) that issued the Policies,
including that such Policies may not be canceled or modified in any material
respect without thirty (30) days' prior notice to Lender, or ten (10) days'
notice with respect to nonpayment of premium. Borrower shall deliver to Lender,
concurrently with each change in any Policy, a certificate with respect to such
changed Policy certified by the insurance company issuing that Policy, in
substantially the same form and containing substantially the same information as
the certificates required to be delivered by Borrower pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.14(b) and stating that all premiums then due thereon
have been paid to the applicable insurers and that the same are in full force
and effect (or if such certificates and/or other information are not obtainable
by Borrower, Borrower may deliver an Officer's Certificate to such effect in
lieu thereof).

previous policy, and shall deliver to Lender a certificate in respect of such
policy or policies (A) containing the same information as the certificates
required to be delivered by Borrower pursuant to clause (b) above, or a copy of
the binding commitment for such policy or policies and (B) confirming that such
policy complies with all requirements hereof.

      (d) If Borrower does not furnish to Lender the certificates as required
under clause (c) above, upon three (3) Business Days prior notice to Borrower,
Lender may procure, but shall not be obligated to procure, such replacement
policy or policies and pay the Insurance Premiums therefor, and Borrower agree
to reimburse Lender for the cost of such Insurance Premiums promptly on demand.

      (e) Concurrently with the delivery of each replacement policy or a binding
commitment for the same, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a report or
attestation from a duly licensed or authorized insurance broker or from the
insurer, setting forth the particulars as to all insurance obtained by Borrower
pursuant to this Section 6.1 and then in effect and stating that all Insurance
Premiums then due thereon have been paid in full to the applicable insurers,
that such insurance policies are in full force and effect and that, in the
opinion of such insurance broker or insurer, such insurance otherwise complies
with the requirements of this Section 6.1 (or if such report shall not be
available after Borrower shall have used reasonable efforts to provide the same,
Borrower will deliver to Lender an Officer's Certificate containing the
information to be provided in such report).

            6.1.15 SEPARATE INSURANCE. Borrower shall not take out separate
insurance contributing in the event of loss with that required to be maintained
pursuant to this Section 6.1 unless such insurance complies with this Section
6.1.

            6.1.16 BLANKET POLICIES. The insurance coverage required under this
Section 6.1 may be effected under a blanket policy or policies covering the
Property and other properties and

                                       99
<PAGE>

assets not constituting a part of the Property; provided that any such blanket
policy shall specify, except in the case of public liability insurance, the
portion of the total coverage of such policy that is allocated to the Property,
and any sublimits in such blanket policy applicable to the Property, which
amounts shall not be less than the amounts required pursuant to this Section 6.1
and which shall in any case comply in all other respects with the requirements
of this Section 6.1. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall deliver to Lender an
Officer's Certificate setting forth (i) the number of properties covered by such
policy, (ii) the location by city (if available, otherwise, county) and state of
the properties, (iii) the average square footage of the properties (or the
aggregate square footage), (iv) a brief description of the typical construction
type included in the blanket policy and (v) such other information as Lender may
reasonably request.

            6.1.17 SECURITIZATION. Following any Securitization, Borrower shall
name any trustee, servicer or special servicer designated by Lender as a loss
payee, and any trustee, servicer and special servicer as additional insureds,
with respect to any Policy for which Lender is to be so named hereunder.

      SECTION 6.2 CONDEMNATION AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS.

            6.2.1 RIGHT TO ADJUST.

      (a) If the Property is damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part in any
material respect, by a Casualty, Borrower shall give prompt written notice
thereof to Lender, generally describing the nature and extent of such Casualty.
Following the occurrence of a Casualty, Borrower, regardless of whether proceeds
are available, shall in a reasonably prompt manner proceed to restore, repair,
replace or rebuild the Property to the extent practicable to be of at least
equal value and of substantially the same character as prior to the Casualty,
all in accordance with the terms hereof applicable to Alterations.

      (b) Subject to clause (e) below, in the event of a Casualty where the loss
does not exceed $5,000,000, Borrower may settle and adjust such claim; provided
that such adjustment is carried out in a competent and timely manner. In such
case, Borrower is hereby authorized to collect and receipt for Lender any
Proceeds.

      (c) Subject to clause (e) below, in the event of a Casualty where the loss
exceeds $5,000,000, Borrower may settle and adjust such claim only with the
consent of Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
and Lender shall have the opportunity to participate, at Borrower's cost, in any
such adjustments.

      (d) The proceeds of any Policy shall be due and payable solely to Lender
and held and applied in accordance with the terms hereof (or, if mistakenly paid
to the Borrower, shall be held in trust by the Borrower for the benefit of
Lender and shall be paid over to Lender by the Borrower within two (2) Business
Days of receipt).

      (e) Notwithstanding the terms of clauses (a) and (b) above, Lender shall
have the sole authority to adjust any claim with respect to a Casualty and to
collect all Proceeds if an Event of Default shall have occurred and is
continuing.

                                      100
<PAGE>

            6.2.2 RIGHT OF THE BORROWER TO APPLY TO RESTORATION. In the event of
(a) a Casualty that does not constitute a Material Casualty, or (b) a
Condemnation that does not constitute a Material Condemnation, Lender shall
permit the application of the Proceeds (after reimbursement of any expenses
incurred by Lender) to reimburse Borrower for the cost of restoring, repairing,
replacing or rebuilding or otherwise curing title defects at the Property (the
Restoration), in the manner required hereby, provided and on the condition that
(1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be then continuing and (2) in
the reasonable judgment of Lender:

            (i) the Property can be restored to an economic unit not materially
less valuable (taking into account the effect of the termination of any Leases
and the proceeds of any rental loss or business interruption insurance which the
Borrower receives or is entitled to receive, in each case, due to such Casualty
or Condemnation) and not materially less useful than the same was prior to the
Casualty or Condemnation,

            (ii) the Property, after such Restoration and stabilization, will
adequately secure the outstanding balance of the Loan,

            (iii) the Restoration can be completed by the earliest to occur of:

                  (A) the date on which the business interruption insurance
            carried by Borrower with respect to the Property shall expire;

                  (B) the 180th day prior to the Maturity Date, and

                  (C) with respect to a Casualty, the expiration of the payment
            period on the rental loss or business interruption insurance
            coverage in respect of such Casualty; and

            (iv) after receiving reasonably satisfactory evidence to such
effect, during the period of the Restoration, the sum of (A) income derived from
each Property (collectively), plus (B) proceeds of rental loss insurance or
business interruption insurance, if any, payable together with such other monies
(including capital contributions) as Borrower may irrevocably make available for
the Restoration, will equal or exceed 105% of the sum of (x) Operating Expenses
and (y) the Debt Service.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any of the conditions set forth in sub-clauses
(1) and (2) of the proviso in this Section 6.2.2 is not satisfied, then, unless
Lender shall otherwise elect, at its sole option, the Proceeds shall be applied
in the following order of priority: (A) first, to prepay the principal of the
Loan up to the Release Amount for such Property; (B) second, to pay the amount
of (1) all accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Principal Amount of the
Indebtedness so prepaid through the date which is the final day of the Interest
Period in which such prepayment is made (including, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is then continuing, interest owed at the Default Rate), and (2) all
other sums then due and owing under the Loan Documents and (C) third, to
reimburse Lender for any fees and expenses of Lender incurred in connection
therewith (it being agreed that, upon satisfaction in full of the entitlements
under clauses (A), (B) and (C) of this sentence, Borrower shall be entitled to
receive the balance of the Proceeds, if any, and a release of the Lien of the
Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents with respect to the Property in
accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 2.3.3 hereof and any surplus

                                      101
<PAGE>

Proceeds shall be paid over to (i) the First Mezzanine Lender to be applied in
accordance with the terms of the First Mezzanine Loan Agreement, or (ii) if the
First Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding, to the Second Mezzanine Lender to
be applied in accordance with the terms of the Second Mezzanine Loan Agreement,
or (iii) if the First Mezzanine Loan and Second Mezzanine Loan are no longer
outstanding, to the Third Mezzanine Lender to be applied in accordance with the
terms of the Third Mezzanine Loan Agreement, or (iv) if the First Mezzanine
Loan, Second Mezzanine Loan, and Third Mezzanine Loan are no longer outstanding,
to the Fourth Mezzanine Lender to be applied in accordance with the terms of the
Fourth Mezzanine Loan Agreement, or (v) if the First Mezzanine Loan, Second
Mezzanine Loan, Third Mezzanine Loan, and Fourth Mezzanine Loan are no longer
outstanding, or, if the Fifth Mezzanine Loan is funded by Fifth Mezzanine Lender
on or before the Outside Date, to the Fifth Mezzanine Lender to be applied in
accordance with the terms of the Fifth Mezzanine Loan Agreement, or (vi) if the
First Mezzanine Loan, Second Mezzanine Loan, Third Mezzanine Loan, Fourth
Mezzanine Loan, and Fifth Mezzanine Loan are no longer outstanding, to the
Borrower's Account.

            6.2.3 MATERIAL CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION AND LENDER'S RIGHT TO APPLY
PROCEEDS. In the event of a Material Casualty or a Material Condemnation, then
Lender shall have the option to (i) apply the Proceeds hereof in the following
order of priority: (A) first, to prepay the principal of the Loan up to the
Release Amount for such Property; (B) second, to pay the amount of (1) all
accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Principal Amount of the
Indebtedness so prepaid through the date which is the final day of the Interest
Period in which such prepayment is made (including, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is then continuing, interest owed at the Default Rate), and (2) all
other sums then due and owing under the Loan Documents; (C) third, to reimburse
Lender for any fees and expenses of Lender incurred in connection therewith; (D)
fourth, the balance of Proceeds shall then be paid to First Mezzanine Lender to
be applied pursuant to the terms of the First Mezzanine Loan Agreement or,
following the repayment of the First Mezzanine Loan to the Second Mezzanine
Lender to be applied pursuant to the terms of the Second Mezzanine Loan
Agreement, or, following the repayment of the First Mezzanine Loan and the
Second Mezzanine Loan, to the Third Mezzanine Lender to be applied pursuant to
the terms of the Third Mezzanine Loan Agreement, or, following the repayment of
the First Mezzanine Loan, the Second Mezzanine Loan, and the Third Mezzanine
Loan, to the Fourth Mezzanine Lender to be applied pursuant to the terms of the
Fourth Mezzanine Loan Agreement, or, following the repayment of the First
Mezzanine Loan, the Second Mezzanine Loan, the Third Mezzanine Loan, and the
Fourth Mezzanine Loan, or, if the Fifth Mezzanine Loan is funded by Fifth
Mezzanine Lender on or before the Outside Date, to the Fifth Mezzanine Lender to
be applied pursuant to the terms of the Fifth Mezzanine Loan Agreement (it being
agreed that, upon satisfaction in full of the entitlements under clauses (A),
(B), (C) and (D) of this sentence, Borrower shall be entitled to receive the
balance of the Proceeds, if any and a release of the Lien of the Security
Instrument and the other Loan Documents with respect to the Property in
accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 2.3.3 hereof), or (ii) make
such Proceeds available to reimburse Borrower for the cost of any Restoration in
the manner set forth below in Section 6.2.4 hereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in the event of a Material Casualty or a Material
Condemnation, where Borrower cannot restore, repair, replace or rebuild the
Property to be of at least substantially equal value and of substantially the
same character as prior to the Material Casualty

                                      102
<PAGE>

or Material Condemnation or title defect because the Property is a legally
non-conforming use or as a result of any other Legal Requirement, Borrower
hereby agrees that Lender may apply the Proceeds payable in connection therewith
in accordance with clauses (A), (B), (C), and (D).

            6.2.4 MANNER OF RESTORATION AND REIMBURSEMENT. If Borrower is
entitled pursuant to Sections 6.2.2 or 6.2.3 above to reimbursement out of
Proceeds (and the conditions specified therein shall have been satisfied), such
Proceeds shall be disbursed on a monthly basis upon Lender being furnished with
(i) such architect's certificates, waivers of lien, contractor's sworn
statements, title insurance endorsements, bonds, plats of survey and such other
evidences of cost, payment and performance as Lender may reasonably require and
approve, and (ii) all plans and specifications for such Restoration, such plans
and specifications to be approved by Lender prior to commencement of any work
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In addition, no
payment made prior to the Final Completion of the Restoration (excluding
punch-list items) shall exceed ninety percent (90%) of the aggregate value of
the work performed from time to time; funds other than Proceeds shall be
disbursed prior to disbursement of such Proceeds; and at all times, the
undisbursed balance of such Proceeds remaining in the hands of Lender, together
with funds deposited for that purpose or irrevocably committed to the
satisfaction of Lender by or on behalf of Borrower for that purpose, shall be at
least sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Lender to pay for the cost of
completion of the Restoration, free and clear of all Liens or claims for Lien.
Prior to any disbursement, Lender shall have received evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the estimated cost of completion of the Restoration (such
estimate to be made by Borrower's architect or contractor and approved by Lender
in its reasonable discretion), and Borrower shall have deposited with Lender
Eligible Collateral in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of such estimated
cost of completion over the net Proceeds. Any surplus which may remain out of
Proceeds received pursuant to a Casualty shall be paid to Borrower after payment
of such costs of Restoration. Any surplus which may remain out of Proceeds
received pursuant to a Condemnation shall be delivered to Lender for deposit
into the Holding Account to be held and disbursed in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

            6.2.5 CONDEMNATION.

      (a) Borrower shall promptly give Lender written notice of the actual
commencement or written threat of commencement of any Condemnation and shall
deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers served in connection with such
Condemnation. Following the occurrence of a Condemnation, Borrower, regardless
of whether Proceeds are available, shall promptly proceed to restore, repair,
replace or rebuild the same to the extent practicable to be of at least equal
value and of substantially the same character as prior to such Condemnation, all
to be effected in accordance with the terms hereof applicable to Alterations.

      (b) Lender is hereby irrevocably appointed as Borrower's attorney-in-fact,
coupled with an interest, with exclusive power to collect, receive and retain
any Proceeds in respect of a Condemnation and to make any compromise or
settlement in connection with such Condemnation, subject to the provisions of
this Section. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (x)
in the event of a Condemnation where the loss does not exceed $5,000,000,
Borrower may settle and compromise such Proceeds; provided that the same is
effected in a competent and timely manner, and (y) in the event of a
Condemnation, where the

                                      103
<PAGE>

loss exceeds $5,000,000, Borrower may settle and compromise the Proceeds only
with the consent of Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and Lender shall have the opportunity to participate, at Borrower'
cost, in any litigation and settlement discussions in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding any Condemnation by any public or quasi-public authority
(including any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of such a
Condemnation), Borrower shall continue to pay the Indebtedness at the time and
in the manner provided for in the Note, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and the Indebtedness shall not be reduced unless and until any
Proceeds shall have been actually received and applied by Lender to discharge
the Indebtedness, pay required interest and pay any other required amounts, in
each case, pursuant to the terms of Sections 6.2.2 or 6.2.3 above. Lender shall
not be limited to the interest paid on the Proceeds by the condemning authority
but shall be entitled to receive out of the Proceeds interest at the rate or
rates provided in the Note. Borrower shall cause any Proceeds that are payable
to Borrower to be paid directly to Lender to be held and applied in accordance
with the terms hereof.

VII. IMPOSITIONS, OTHER CHARGES, LIENS AND OTHER ITEMS

      SECTION 7.1 BORROWER TO PAY IMPOSITIONS AND OTHER CHARGES. Subject to the
third sentence of this Section 7.1, Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid all
Impositions now or hereafter levied or assessed or imposed against the Property
or any part thereof prior to the imposition of any interest, charges or expenses
for the non-payment thereof and shall pay all Other Charges on or before the
date they are due. Subject to Borrower's right of contest set forth in Section
7.3, as set forth in the next two sentences and provided that there are
sufficient funds available in the Tax Reserve Account, Lender, on behalf of
Borrower, shall pay all Impositions and Other Charges which are attributable to
or affect the Property or Borrower, prior to the date such Impositions or Other
Charges shall become delinquent or late charges may be imposed thereon, directly
to the applicable taxing authority with respect thereto. Lender shall, or Lender
shall direct the Cash Management Bank to, pay to the taxing authority such
amounts to the extent funds in the Tax Reserve Account are sufficient to pay
such Impositions. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Security Instrument
shall be construed to require Borrower to pay any tax, assessment, levy or
charge imposed on Lender in the nature of a franchise, capital levy, estate,
inheritance, succession, income or net revenue tax.

      SECTION 7.2 NO LIENS. Subject to its right of contest set forth in Section
7.3, Borrower shall at all times keep, or cause to be kept, the Property free
from all Liens (other than Permitted Encumbrances) and shall pay when due and
payable (or bond over) all claims and demands of mechanics, materialmen,
laborers and others which, if unpaid, might result in or permit the creation of
a Lien on the Property or any portion thereof and shall in any event cause the
prompt, full and unconditional discharge of all Liens imposed on or against the
Property or any portion thereof within forty-five (45) days after receiving
written notice of the filing (whether from Lender, the lienor or any other
Person) thereof. Borrower shall do or cause to be done, at the sole cost of
Borrower, everything reasonably necessary to fully preserve the first priority
of the Lien of the Security Instrument against the Property, subject to the
Permitted Encumbrances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default with respect to its Obligations as set forth in this Article
VII, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) make such payment or discharge
such Lien, and Borrower shall reimburse Lender on demand for all such advances
pursuant to Section 19.12 (together with interest thereon at the Default Rate).

                                      104
<PAGE>

      SECTION 7.3 CONTEST. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require
Borrower to pay, or cause to be paid, any Imposition or to satisfy any Lien, or
to comply with any Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement, so long as
Borrower is in good faith, and by proper legal proceedings, where appropriate,
diligently contesting the validity, amount or application thereof, provided that
in each case, at the time of the commencement of any such action or proceeding,
and during the pendency of such action or proceeding (i) no Event of Default
shall exist and be continuing hereunder, (ii) Borrower shall keep Lender
informed of the status of such contest at reasonable intervals, (iii) if
Borrower is not providing security as provided in clause (vi) below, adequate
reserves with respect thereto are maintained on Borrower's books in accordance
with GAAP or in the Tax Reserve Account or Insurance Reserve Account, as
applicable, (iv) either such contest operates to suspend collection or
enforcement as the case may be, of the contested Imposition, Lien or Legal
Requirement and such contest is maintained and prosecuted continuously and with
diligence or the Imposition or Lien is bonded, (v) in the case of any Insurance
Requirement, the failure of Borrower to comply therewith shall not impair the
validity of any insurance required to be maintained by Borrower under Section
6.1 or the right to full payment of any claims thereunder, and (vi) in the case
of Impositions and Liens which are not bonded in excess of $1,000,000
individually, or in the aggregate, during such contest, Borrower, shall deposit
with or deliver to Lender either Cash and Cash Equivalents or a Letter or
Letters of Credit in an amount equal to 125% of (A) the amount of Borrower's
obligations being contested plus (B) any additional interest, charge, or penalty
arising from such contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the creation of any
such reserves or the furnishing of any bond or other security, Borrower promptly
shall comply with any contested Legal Requirement or Insurance Requirement or
shall pay any contested Imposition or Lien, and compliance therewith or payment
thereof shall not be deferred, if, at any time the Property or any portion
thereof shall be, in Lender's reasonable judgment, in imminent danger of being
forfeited or lost or Lender is likely to be subject to civil or criminal damages
as a result thereof. If such action or proceeding is terminated or discontinued
adversely to Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Lender reasonable evidence of
Borrower's compliance with such contested Imposition, Lien, Legal Requirements
or Insurance Requirements, as the case may be.

longer necessary in connection with the operation of the Property free from the
Lien of the Security Instrument provided that such Transfer or disposal will not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of the Property taken as a whole,

provided under clause (h)(i) below; provided that if, as reasonably determined
by the Lender, such Alteration or Expansion (or then current Alterations or
Expansions in the aggregate) would adversely affect the annual Net Operating
Income, then in order to proceed with the Alteration or Expansion the Borrower
shall deliver to Lender Eligible Collateral in the amount that the estimated
total reduction in Net Operating Income resulting from the Alteration or
Expansion exceeds $1,000,000 as additional security for the Indebtedness, which
Eligible Collateral shall be returned to Borrower after completion of the
Alteration or Expansion if the reduction in Net Operating Income attributable to
such Alteration or Expansion pursuant to this Section 10.2(d) has been restored
and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

      (e) All work done in connection with any Alteration or Expansion shall be
performed with due diligence to Final Completion in a good and workmanlike
manner, all materials used in connection with any Alteration or Expansion shall
be not less than the standard of quality of the materials generally used at the
Property as of the date hereof (or, if greater, the then-current customary
quality in the sub-market in which the Property is located) and all work shall
be performed and all materials used in accordance with all applicable Legal
Requirements and Insurance Requirements.

      (f) The cost of any Alteration or Expansion shall be promptly and fully
paid for by Borrower, subject to the next succeeding sentence. Without Lender's
prior written consent, no payment made prior to the Final Completion (excluding
punch-list items) of an Alteration or Expansion or Restoration to any
contractor, subcontractor, materialman, supplier, engineer, architect, project
manager or other Person who renders services or furnishes materials in
connection with such Alteration shall exceed ninety percent (90%) of the
aggregate value of the work performed by such Person (other than any retention
for major contractors who have completed their work) from time to time and
materials furnished and incorporated into the Improvements.

      (g) Subject to the terms of Section 10.2(i), all work performed in
connection with the Approved Base Building Work listed on Schedule II shall be
performed in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in clauses (a),
(e) and (f) of this Section 10.2.

      (h) Subject to the terms of Section 10.2(i), with respect to any Material
Alteration or Material Expansion:

            (i) Borrower shall have delivered to Lender Eligible Collateral in
an amount equal to at least the total estimated remaining unpaid costs of such
Material Alteration or Material Expansion which is in excess of the Threshold
Amount, which Eligible Collateral shall be held by Lender as security for the
Indebtedness and released to Borrower as such work progresses in accordance with
Section 10.2(h)(iii); provided, however, in the event that any Material
Alteration or Material Expansion shall be made in conjunction with any
Restoration with respect to which Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw
Proceeds pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof (including any Proceeds remaining after
completion of such Restoration), the amount of the Eligible Collateral to be
furnished pursuant hereto need not exceed the aggregate cost of such Restoration
and such Material Alteration or Material Expansion (in either case, as estimated
by the Independent Architect) less the sum of the amount of any Proceeds which
the Borrower is entitled to withdraw pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof and the
Threshold Amount.

                                      117
<PAGE>

            (ii) Prior to commencement of construction of such Material
Alteration or Material Expansion, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a schedule
(with the concurrence of the Independent Architect) setting forth the projected
stages of completion of such Alteration or Expansion and the corresponding
amounts expected to be due and payable by or on behalf of Borrower in connection
with such completion, such schedule to be updated quarterly by Borrower (and
with the concurrence of the Independent Architect) during the performance of
such Alteration or Expansion.

            (iii) Any Eligible Collateral that a Borrower delivers to Lender
pursuant hereto (and the proceeds of any such Eligible Collateral) shall be
invested (to the extent such Eligible Collateral can be invested) by Lender in
Permitted Investments for a period of time consistent with the date on which the
Borrower notifies Lender that the Borrower expects to request a release of such
Eligible Collateral in accordance with the next succeeding sentence. From time
to time as the Alteration or Expansion progresses, the amount of any Eligible
Collateral so furnished may, upon the written request of Borrower to Lender, be
withdrawn by Borrower and paid or otherwise applied by or returned to Borrower
in an amount equal to the amount Borrower would be entitled to so withdraw if
Section 6.2.4 were applicable, and any Eligible Collateral so furnished which is
a Letter of Credit may be reduced by Borrower in an amount equal to the amount
Borrower would be entitled to so reduce if Section 6.2.4 hereof were applicable,
subject, in each case, to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to
withdrawal of funds or reduction of the Letter of Credit set forth in Section
6.2.4 hereof. In connection with the above-described quarterly update of the
projected stages of completion of the Material Alteration or Material Expansion
(as concurred with by an Independent Architect), Borrower shall increase (or be
permitted to decrease, as applicable) the Eligible Collateral then deposited
with Lender as necessary to comply with Section 10.2(h)(i) hereof.

            (iv) At any time after Final Completion of such Material Alterations
or Material Expansions, the whole balance of any Cash deposited with Lender
pursuant to Section 10.2(h) hereof then remaining on deposit may be withdrawn by
Borrower and shall be paid by Lender to Borrower, and any Eligible Collateral so
deposited shall, to the extent it has not been called upon, reduced or
theretofore released, be released by Lender to Borrower, within ten (10) days
after receipt by Lender of an application for such withdrawal and/or release
together with an Officer's Certificate, and as to the following clauses (A) and
(B) of this clause also a certificate of the Independent Architect, setting
forth in substance as follows:

                  (A) that such Material Alteration(s) or Material Expansion(s)
            has been completed in all material respects in accordance with any
            plans and specifications therefor previously filed with Lender under
            Section 10.2(c) hereof;

                  (B) that to the knowledge of the certifying Person, (x) such
            Material Alteration(s) or Material Expansion(s) has been completed
            in compliance with all Legal Requirements, and (y) to the extent
            required for the legal use or occupancy of the portion of the
            Property affected by such Alteration(s) or Expansion(s), the
            applicable Borrower has obtained a temporary or permanent
            certificate of occupancy (or similar certificate) or, if no such
            certificate is required, a statement to that effect;

                                      118
<PAGE>

                  (C) that to the knowledge of the certifying Person, all
            amounts that a Borrower is or may become liable to pay in respect of
            such Material Alteration(s) or Material Expansion(s) through the
            date of the certification have been paid in full or adequately
            provided for and, to the extent that such are customary and
            reasonably obtainable by prudent property owners in the area where
            the applicable Property is located, that Lien waivers have been
            obtained from the general contractor and subcontractors performing
            such Alteration(s) or Expansion(s) or at its sole cost and expense,
            Borrower shall cause a nationally recognized title insurance company
            to deliver to Lender an endorsement to the Title Policy, updating
            such policy and insuring over such Liens without further exceptions
            to such policy other than Permitted Encumbrances, or shall, at its
            sole cost and expense, cause a reputable title insurance company to
            deliver a lender's title insurance policy, in such form, in such
            amounts and with such endorsements as the Title Policy, which policy
            shall be dated the date of completion of the Material Alteration and
            shall contain no exceptions other than Permitted Encumbrances;
            provided, however, that if, for any reason, Borrower are unable to
            deliver the certification required by this clause (C) with respect
            to any costs or expenses relating to the Alteration(s) or
            Expansion(s), then, assuming Borrower are able to satisfy each of
            the other requirements set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above,
            Borrower shall be entitled to the release of the difference between
            the whole balance of such Eligible Collateral and the total of all
            costs and expenses to which Borrower are unable to certify; and

                  (D) that to the knowledge of the certifying Person, no Event
            of Default has occurred and is continuing.

      (i) Lender hereby agrees that Borrower shall not be required to comply
with the terms of Sections 10.2 (b), (c), (d), (g) and (h) hereof with respect
to the current projects relating to the Property that are more particularly
described on attached Schedule XVI (collectively, the EXISTING PROJECTS);
provided, however, any such Existing Project is also subject to the following
conditions:

            (i) Borrower shall complete such Existing Project no less than six
(6) months prior to the Maturity Date (with a permanent certificate of occupancy
for such Existing Project delivered to Lender before the expiration of such six
(6) month period or, if no such permanent certificate of occupancy has been
issued, delivery to Lender of a temporary certificate of occupancy with no
material conditions remaining that are necessary to deliver a permanent
certificate of occupancy to Lender);

            (ii) Prior to the commencement of such Existing Project, Borrower
shall deliver to Lender a capital expenditure funding plan that includes the
sources of funding for such Existing Project, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Lender;

            (iii) Guarantor shall deliver to Lender a completion guaranty in the
form of Exhibit S attached hereto prior to the commencement of any such Existing
Project; provided,

                                      119
<PAGE>

however, if Guarantor's net worth, as reasonably determined by lender, shall be
less than the Minimum Net Worth at the commencement of such Existing Project,
Borrower shall deliver a completion guaranty from an entity that has the
required Minimum Net Worth.

XII.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

      SECTION 12.1 REPRESENTATIONS. Borrower hereby represents and warrants that
except as set forth in the environmental reports and studies delivered to Lender
(the ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS), (i) Borrower (to the Best of Borrower's Knowledge
for the period prior to April 2, 2004) has not engaged in or knowingly permitted
any operations or activities upon, or any use or occupancy of the Property, or
any portion thereof, for the purpose of or in any way involving the handling,
manufacture, treatment, storage, use, generation, release, discharge, refining,
dumping or disposal of any Hazardous Materials on, under, in or about the
Property, or transported any Hazardous Materials to, from or across the
Property, except in all cases in material compliance with Environmental Laws and
only in the course of legitimate business operations at the Property; (ii) to
the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, no tenant, occupant or user of the Property,
or any other Person, has engaged in or permitted any operations or activities
upon, or any use or occupancy of the Property, or any portion thereof, for the
purpose of or in any material way

                                      122
<PAGE>

involving the handling, manufacture, treatment, storage, use, generation,
release, discharge, refining, dumping or disposal of any Hazardous Materials on,
in or about the Property, or transported any Hazardous Materials to, from or
across the Property, except in all cases in material compliance with
Environmental Laws and only in the course of legitimate business operations at
the Property; (iii) to the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, no Hazardous Materials
are presently constructed, deposited, stored, or otherwise located on, under, in
or about the Property except in material compliance with Environmental Laws;
(iv) to the Best of Borrower's Knowledge, no Hazardous Materials have migrated
from the Property upon or beneath other properties which would reasonably be
expected to result in material liability for Borrower; and (v) to the Best of
Borrower's Knowledge, no Hazardous Materials have migrated or threaten to
migrate from other properties upon, about or beneath the Property which would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability for Borrower.

      SECTION 12.2 COVENANTS.

            12.2.1 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Subject to Borrower's
right to contest under Section 7.3, Borrower covenants and agrees with Lender
that it shall comply with all Environmental Laws. If at any time during the
continuance of the Lien of the Security Instrument, a Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the Property requires remedial action to correct the
presence of Hazardous Materials in, around, or under the Property (an
ENVIRONMENTAL EVENT), Borrower shall deliver prompt notice of the occurrence of
such Environmental Event to Lender. Within thirty (30) days after Borrower has
knowledge of the occurrence of an Environmental Event, Borrower shall deliver to
Lender an Officer's Certificate (an ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATE) explaining the
Environmental Event in reasonable detail and setting forth the proposed remedial
action, if any. Borrower shall promptly provide Lender with copies of all
notices which allege or identify any actual or potential violation or
noncompliance received by or prepared by or for Borrower in connection with any
Environmental Law. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "notice" shall mean
any summons, citation, directive, order, claim, pleading, letter, application,
filing, report, findings, declarations or other materials pertinent to
compliance of the Property and Borrower with such Environmental Laws.

      12.2.2 RESERVED.

      SECTION 12.3 ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Environmental Event with respect to the Property or an Event
of Default, Lender shall have the right to have its consultants perform a
comprehensive environmental audit of the Property. Such audit shall be conducted
by an environmental consultant chosen by Lender and may include a visual survey,
a record review, an area reconnaissance assessing the presence of hazardous or
toxic waste or substances, PCBs or storage tanks at the Property, an asbestos
survey of the Property, which may include random sampling of the Improvements
and air quality testing, and such further site assessments as Lender may
reasonably require due to the results obtained from the foregoing. Borrower
grants Lender, its agents, consultants and contractors the right to enter the
Property as reasonable or appropriate for the circumstances for the purposes of
performing such studies and the reasonable cost of such studies shall be due and
payable by Borrower to Lender upon demand and shall be secured by the Lien of
the Security Instrument. Lender shall not unreasonably interfere with, and
Lender shall direct the environmental consultant to use its commercially
reasonable efforts not to hinder, Borrower's or any Tenant's,

                                      123
<PAGE>

other occupant's or Manager's operations upon the Property when conducting such
audit, sampling or inspections. By undertaking any of the measures identified in
and pursuant to this Section 12.3, Lender shall not be deemed to be exercising
any control over the operations of Borrower or the handling of any environmental
matter or hazardous wastes or substances of Borrower for purposes of incurring
or being subject to liability therefor.

      SECTION 12.4 ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNIFICATION. Borrower shall protect,
indemnify, save, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all liability, loss, damage, actions, causes of action, costs or
expenses whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and any
and all claims, suits and judgments which any Indemnified Party may suffer, as a
result of or with respect to: (a) any Environmental Claim relating to or arising
from the Property; (b) the violation of any Environmental Law in connection with
the Property; (c) any release, spill, or the presence of any Hazardous Materials
affecting the Property; and (d) the presence at, in, on or under, or the
release, escape, seepage, leakage, discharge or migration at or from, the
Property of any Hazardous Materials, whether or not such condition was known or
unknown to Borrower; provided that, in each case, Borrower shall be relieved of
its obligation under this subsection if any of the matters referred to in
clauses (a) through (d) above did not occur (but need not have been discovered)
prior to (1) the foreclosure of the Security Instrument, (2) the delivery by
Borrower to Lender or its designee of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with respect
to the Property, or (3) Lender's or its designee's taking possession and control
of the Property after the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder. If any
such action or other proceeding shall be brought against Lender, upon written
notice from Borrower to Lender (given reasonably promptly following Lender's
notice to Borrower of such action or proceeding), Borrower shall be entitled to
assume the defense thereof, at Borrower's expense, with counsel reasonably
acceptable to Lender; provided, however, Lender may, at its own expense, retain
separate counsel to participate in such defense, but such participation shall
not be deemed to give Lender a right to control such defense, which right
Borrower expressly retains. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at Borrower's expense if,
in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel, a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and Borrower that would make such separate
representation advisable. Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify an
Indemnified Party for damage or loss resulting from such Indemnified Party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

      SECTION 12.5 RECOURSE NATURE OF CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATIONS. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, the indemnification provided in Section 12.4 shall be fully recourse
to Borrower and shall be independent of, and shall survive, the discharge of the
Indebtedness, the release of the Lien created by the Security Instrument, and/or
the conveyance of title to the Property to Lender or any purchaser or designee
in connection with a foreclosure of the Security Instrument or conveyance in
lieu of foreclosure.

XIII. THE GROUND LEASE.

      SECTION 13.1 LEASEHOLD REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES. Borrower hereby

      (a)   the Ground Lease is in full force and effect, unmodified by any
writing or otherwise, and Borrower has not waived, canceled or surrendered any
of its rights thereunder;

      (b)   except with respect to the Ground Lease involving the Doral
Property, as to which there is a dispute regarding whether certain additional
rent amounts for periods prior to the date hereof totaling less than $125,000
are actually payable, all rent, additional rent and/or other charges reserved in
or payable under the Ground Lease have been paid to the extent that they are
payable to the date hereof;

      (c)   Borrower enjoys the quiet and peaceful possession of the Leasehold
Estate;

      (d)   Borrower has not delivered or received any notices of default under
the Ground Lease and to the Best of Borrower's Knowledge is not in default under
any of the terms of the Ground Lease, and there are no circumstances which, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default
under the Ground Lease;

      (e)   Fee Owner is not in default under any of the terms of the Ground
Lease on its part to be observed and performed;

      (f)   Borrower has delivered to Lender a true, accurate and complete copy

      SECTION 13.2 CURE BY LENDER. In the event of a default by Borrower in the
performance of any of its obligations under the Ground Lease, including, without
limitation, any default in the payment of any sums payable thereunder, then, in
each and every such case, Lender may, at its option, cause the default or
defaults to be remedied and otherwise exercise any and all rights of Borrower
thereunder in the name of and on behalf of Borrower. Borrower shall, on demand,
reimburse Lender for all advances made and expenses incurred by Lender in curing
any such default (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements), together with interest thereon computed at the Default Rate from
the date that such advance is made to and including the date the same is paid to
Lender.

      SECTION 13.3 OPTION TO RENEW OR EXTEND THE GROUND LEASE. Borrower shall
give Lender written notice of its intention to exercise each and every option,
if any, to renew or extend the term of the Ground Lease, at least thirty (30)
days prior to the expiration of the time to exercise such option under the terms
thereof. If required by Lender, Borrower shall duly exercise any renewal or
extension option with respect to any of the Ground Lease if Lender reasonably
determines that the exercise of such option is necessary to protect Lender's
security for the Loan. If Borrower intends to renew or extend the term of the
Ground Lease, it shall deliver to Lender, with the notice of such decision, a
copy of the notice of renewal or extension delivered to Fee Owner, together with
the terms and conditions of such renewal or extension. If Borrower does not
renew or extend the term of the Ground Lease, Lender may, at its option,
exercise the option to renew or extend in the name of and on behalf of Borrower.
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as its attorney-in-fact, coupled
with an interest, to execute

                                      125

necessary under the Ground Lease or otherwise to cause any renewal or extension
of the Ground Lease.

      SECTION 13.4 GROUND LEASE COVENANTS.

            13.4.1 WAIVER OF INTEREST IN NEW GROUND LEASE. In the event the
Ground Lease shall be terminated by reason of a default thereunder by Borrower
and Lender shall require from Fee Owner a new ground lease, Borrower hereby
waives any right, title and interest in and to such new ground lease or the
leasehold estate created thereby, waiving all rights of redemption now or
hereafter operable under any law.

            13.4.2 NO ELECTION TO TERMINATE. Borrower shall not elect to treat
the Ground Lease as terminated, canceled or surrendered pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (including, without limitation,
Section 365(h)(1) thereof) without Lender's prior written consent in the event
of Fee Owner's bankruptcy. In addition, Borrower shall, in the event of Fee
Owner's bankruptcy, reaffirm and ratify the legality, validity, binding effect
and enforceability of the Ground Lease and shall remain in possession of the
Property and the Leasehold Estate, notwithstanding any rejection thereof by Fee
Owner or any trustee, custodian or receiver.

            13.4.3 NOTICE PRIOR TO REJECTION. Borrower shall give Lender not
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of the date on which Borrower
shall apply to any court or other governmental authority for authority and
permission to reject the Ground Lease in the event that there shall be filed by
or against Borrower any petition, action or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code
or under any other similar federal or state law now or hereafter in effect and
if Borrower determines to reject the Ground Lease. Lender shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to serve upon Borrower within such thirty (30) day
period a notice stating that (i) Lender demands that Borrower assume and assign
the Ground Lease to Lender subject to and in accordance with the Bankruptcy
Code, and (ii) Lender covenants to cure or provide reasonably adequate assurance
thereof with respect to all defaults reasonably susceptible of being cured by
Lender and of future performance under the Ground Lease. If Lender serves upon
Borrower the notice described above, Borrower shall not seek to reject the
Ground Lease and shall comply with the demand provided for clause (i) above
within fifteen (15) days after the notice shall have been given by Lender.

            13.4.4 LENDER RIGHT TO PERFORM. During the continuance of an Event
of Default, Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, (i) to perform
and comply with all obligations of Borrower under the Ground Lease without
relying on any grace period provided therein, (ii) to do and take, without any
obligation to do so, such actions as Lender deems necessary or desirable to
prevent or cure any default by Borrower under the Ground Lease, including,
without limitation, any act, deed, matter or thing whatsoever that Borrower may
do in order to cure a default under the Ground Lease and (iii) to enter in and
upon the Property or any part thereof to such extent and as often as Lender
deems necessary or desirable in order to prevent or cure any default of Borrower
under the Ground Lease. Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days after
written request is made therefor by Lender, execute and deliver to Lender or to
any party designated by Lender, such further instruments, agreements, powers,
assignments,

                                      126
<PAGE>

conveyances or the like as may be reasonably necessary to complete or perfect
the interest, rights or powers of Lender pursuant to this Section or as may
otherwise be required by Lender.

            13.4.5 LENDER ATTORNEY IN FACT. In the event of any arbitration
under or pursuant to the Ground Lease in which Lender elects to participate,
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful
attorney-in-fact (which appointment shall be deemed coupled with an interest) to
exercise, during the continuance of an Event of Default, all right, title and
interest of Borrower in connection with such arbitration, including, without
limitation, the right to appoint arbitrators and to conduct arbitration
proceedings on behalf of Borrower and Lender. All costs and expenses incurred by
Lender in connection with such arbitration and the settlement thereof shall be
borne solely by Borrower, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
disbursements. Nothing contained in this Section shall obligate Lender to
participate in any such arbitration.

            13.4.6 PAYMENT OF RENT. Borrower promptly shall pay the rent and all
other sums and charges mentioned in, and payable under, the Ground Lease.

            13.4.7 PERFORMANCE OF COVENANTS. Borrower shall promptly perform and
observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions required to be performed and
observed by the lessee under the Ground Lease, the breach of which could permit
any party to the Ground Lease validly to terminate the Ground Lease (including,
without limitation, all payment obligations), shall do all things necessary to
preserve and to keep unimpaired its rights under the Ground Lease, shall not
waive, excuse or discharge any of the material obligations of Fee Owner without
Lender's prior written consent in each instance, and shall diligently and
continuously enforce the obligations of the Fee Owner.

            13.4.8 NO DEFAULTS. Borrower shall not do, permit or suffer any
event or omission as a result of which there could occur a default by the
Borrower under the Ground Lease or any event which, with the giving of notice or
the passage of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Borrower under
the Ground Lease which could permit any party to the Ground Lease validly to
terminate the Ground Lease (including, without limitation, a default in any
payment obligation), and Borrower shall obtain the consent or approval of Fee
Owner to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Ground Lease.

            13.4.9 NO MODIFICATION. Borrower shall not cancel, terminate,
surrender, modify or amend or in any way alter, surrender all or any portion of
the Property, permit the alteration of any of the provisions of the Ground Lease
or agree to any termination, amendment, modification or surrender of the Ground
Lease without Lender's prior written consent in each instance, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided such amendment or modification does
not increase in any material respect Borrower's obligations thereunder or
shorten the term thereof.

            13.4.10 NOTICES OF DEFAULT. Borrower shall deliver to Lender copies
of any notice of default by any party under the Ground Lease, or of any notice
from Fee Owner of its intention to terminate the Ground Lease or to re-enter and
take possession of any portion of the Property, immediately upon delivery or
receipt of such notice, as the case may be.

            13.4.11 DELIVERY OF INFORMATION. Borrower shall promptly furnish to
Lender copies of such information and evidence as Lender may request concerning
Borrower's due observance, performance and compliance with the terms, covenants
and conditions of the Ground Lease.

            13.4.12 NO SUBORDINATION. Borrower shall not consent to the
subordination of the Ground Lease to any mortgage or other lease of the fee
interest in any portion of the property.

            13.4.13 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrower, at its sole cost and expense,
shall execute and deliver to Lender, within five (5) Business Days after
request, such documents, instruments or agreements as may be required to permit
Lender to cure any default under the Ground Lease.

            13.4.14 ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES. Borrower shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Lender within twenty (20) days after
written demand by Lender, an estoppel certificate from Fee Owner setting forth

modified, the date of each modification (together with copies of each such
modification), (iii) the date to which all rental charges have been paid by the
lessee under the Ground Lease, (iv) whether there are any alleged defaults of
the lessee under the Ground Lease and, if there are, setting forth the nature
thereof in reasonable detail, (v) if the lessee under the Ground Lease shall be
in default, the default and (vi) such other matters as Lender shall reasonably
request.

      SECTION 13.5 LENDER RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE. Lender shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to proceed in respect of any claim, suit, action or
proceeding relating to the rejection of the Ground Lease by Fee Owner as a
result of Fee Owner's bankruptcy, including, without limitation, the right to
file and prosecute any and all proofs of claims, complaints, notices and other
documents in any case in respect of Fee Owner under and pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code.

      SECTION 13.6 NO LIABILITY. Lender shall have no liability or obligation
under the Ground Lease by reason of its acceptance of the Security Instrument,
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Lender shall be liable for the
obligations of the lessee arising under the Ground Lease for only that period of
time during which Lender is in possession of the portion of the Property covered
by said Ground Lease or has acquired, by foreclosure or otherwise, and is
holding all of Borrower's right, title and interest therein.

securities (the SECURITIES) secured by or evidencing ownership interests in the
Notes and this Agreement, including, without limitation, to do (or cause to be
done) the following (but Borrower shall not in any event be required to incur,
suffer or accept (except to a de minimis extent)) any lesser rights or greater
obligations or liability than as currently set forth in the Loan Documents
(except any increase in the weighted average interest rate of the Notes that may
result after certain prepayments of the Loan have been made and applied in
accordance with the terms hereof):

consist of a "Review Letter" in substantially the form attached hereto as
Schedule XIV and bring downs of the Opinions of Counsel delivered as of the date

DOCUMENTS. Subject to Section 14.1.1, at its cost and expense, execute and
deliver all documentation and take all actions deemed reasonably necessary or
desirable by the holders of the Notes for the implementation of any

Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents as may be reasonably requested
by Lender or the Rating Agencies in order to achieve the required rating or to
effect the Securitization (including, without limitation, modifying the Payment

the Note), provided, that nothing contained in this Section 14.1.3 shall result
in any economic or other adverse change in the transaction contemplated by the
Security Instrument or the other Loan Documents (unless Borrower is made whole
by the holder of Note) or result in any operational changes that are burdensome
to the Property or Borrower (except any changes that result from the creation of

Purpose Entity, to require periodic updates of accounting matters, appraisals
and environmental and engineering assessments at origination of and/or during
the term of the Loan. In respect of this Agreement, each of Borrower

other service providers engaged in connection with a Securitization, counsel to
any such persons, and such other persons as may be designated by the holders of
the Notes from time to time. Until the Obligations are paid in full, Borrower
shall provide the Rating Agencies, accountants or trustee with all financial
reports required hereunder and such other information as they shall reasonably
request, including copies of any default notices or other material notices

      SECTION 14.3 SECURITIZATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Borrower acknowledges
that all such financial information delivered by Borrower to Lender pursuant to
Article XI may, at Lender's option, be delivered to the Rating Agencies.

      SECTION 14.4 SECURITIZATION INDEMNIFICATION.

            14.4.1 DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS. Subject to Section 19.23, Borrower
understands that certain of the Provided Information may be included in
disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization, including a
prospectus or private placement memorandum or a public registration statement
(each, a DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT) and may also be included in filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the SECURITIES ACT) or the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the EXCHANGE ACT), or provided or made available to investors or
prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating Agencies, and service
providers relating to the Securitization. In the event that the Disclosure
Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all Securities, upon
request, Borrower shall reasonably cooperate with the holder of the Note in
updating the Provided Information for inclusion or summary in the Disclosure
Document by providing all current information pertaining to Borrower and the
Property reasonably requested by Lender.

            14.4.2 INDEMNIFICATION CERTIFICATE. In connection with each of (x) a
preliminary and a private placement memorandum, or (y) a preliminary and final
prospectus, as applicable, Borrower agrees to provide, at its cost and expense
and at Lender's reasonable request, an indemnification certificate:

      (a)   certifying that Borrower has carefully examined those portions of
such memorandum or prospectus, as applicable, reasonably designated in writing
by Lender for Borrower's review pertaining to Borrower, the Property, the Loan
and/or the Provided Information and insofar as such sections or portions thereof
specifically pertain to Borrower, the Property, the Provided Information or the
Loan (such portions, the RELEVANT PORTIONS), the Relevant Portions do not
(except to the extent specified by Borrower if Borrower does not agree with the
statements therein), as of the date of such certificate, to the Best of
Borrower's Knowledge, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

      (b)   indemnifying Lender and the Affiliates of Deutsche Bank Securities,
Inc. (collectively, DBS) that have prepared the Disclosure Document relating to
the Securitization, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed
the Disclosure Document and each person or entity who controls DBS within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the DBS GROUP), and DBS, together with the DBS Group, each of
their respective directors and each person who controls DBS or the DBS Group,
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the
Exchange Act (collectively, the UNDERWRITER GROUP) for any actual, out-of-pocket
losses, third party claims, damages (excluding lost profits, diminution in value
and other consequential damages) or liabilities arising out of third party
claims (the LIABILITIES) to which any member of the Underwriter Group may become
subject to the extent such Liabilities arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement of any material fact contained in the Relevant Portions and in the

                                      131
<PAGE>

Provided Information or arise out of or are based upon the omission by Borrower
to state therein a material fact required to be stated in the Relevant Portions
in order to make the statements in the Relevant Portions in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that (x)
Borrower's obligation to indemnify in respect of any information contained in a
preliminary or final registration statement, private placement memorandum or
preliminary or final prospectus shall be limited to any untrue statement or
omission of material fact therein known to Borrower to the extent in breach of
Borrower's certification made pursuant to clause (a) above and (y) Borrower
shall have no responsibility for the failure of any member of the Underwriting
Group to accurately transcribe written information supplied by Borrower or to
include such portions of the Provided Information).

      (c)   Borrower's liability under clauses (a) and (b) above shall be
limited to Liabilities arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or
omission made in a Disclosure Document in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished to Lender by, or furnished at the direction and on behalf
of, Borrower in connection with the preparation of those portions of the
registration statement, memorandum or prospectus pertaining to Borrower, the
Property or the Loan, including financial statements of Borrower and operating
statements with respect to the Property, under Relevant Portions of the
Disclosure Documents which have been provided in advance to Borrower and
Borrower's reasonable comments in respect thereof are incorporated. This
indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Borrower may
otherwise have.

      (d)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Article
XIV of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if
a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under
this Article XIV, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with
any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
(or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party under this Article XIV of its assumption of such defense, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other
indemnified parties that are different from or in conflict with those available
to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right
to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or
parties at the expense of the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall
not be liable for the expenses of separate counsel unless an indemnified party
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it
that are different from or in conflict with those available to another
indemnified party.

                                      132
<PAGE>

      (e)   In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity provided for in this Article XIV is for any
reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party in respect of any
actual, out-of-pocket losses, claims, damages or liabilities relating to third
party claims (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would
otherwise be indemnifiable under this Article XIV, the indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of
such actual, out of pocket losses, third party claims, damages or liabilities
(or action in respect thereof) (but excluding damages for lost profits,
diminution in value of the Property and consequential damages); provided,
however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution for Liabilities arising therefrom from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of
contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the following factors
shall be considered: (i) the DBS Group's and Borrower's relative knowledge and
access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was
asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission;
(iii) the limited responsibilities and obligations of Borrower as specified
herein; and (iv) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the
circumstances.

      SECTION 14.5 RETENTION OF SERVICER. Lender reserves the right, at
Borrower's sole cost and expense, to retain the Servicer. Lender has advised
Borrower that the Servicer initially retained by Lender shall be Midland Loan

administrative fees and expenses of the Servicer, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney and other third-party fees and disbursements in connection
with a prepayment, release of the Property, Securitization, assumption or
modification of the Loan or enforcement of the Loan Documents. Borrower shall
pay the ongoing standard monthly servicing fee.

      SECTION 14.6 RATING AGENCY SURVEILLANCE FEES AND TRUSTEE FEES. Borrower
shall pay all ongoing Rating Agency surveillance and administrative fees, costs

Affiliate of Lender) with respect to (i) the making of the Loan, (ii) the

is qualified as an Approved Bank and agrees to hold the same in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the agreement pursuant to which such items were
deposited.

      SECTION 15.3 CONTENT. By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, Lender and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance, Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security
interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (ii) Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition

the performance or observance by Borrower of any of its obligations under any
Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
(v) such assignee appoints and authorizes Lender to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Loan Documents
as are delegated to Lender by the terms hereof together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees
that it will perform, in accordance with their terms, all of the obligations
which by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required
to be performed by Lender.

      SECTION 15.4 REGISTER. Lender shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of Lender and each assignee pursuant to this Article XV
and the Principal Amount of the Loan owing to each such assignee from time to
time (the REGISTER). The entries in the Register shall, with respect to such
assignees, be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or any assignee
pursuant to this Article XV at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior written notice.

      SECTION 15.5 SUBSTITUTE NOTES. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and

completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit J hereto, (i) accept such

the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note to the order of such assignee in an
amount equal to the portion of the Loan assigned to it and a new Note to the
order of Lender in an amount equal to the portion of the Loan retained by it
hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate Principal Amount
equal to the aggregate then outstanding principal amount of such surrendered
Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the Note
(modified, however, to the extent necessary so as not to impose duplicative or
increased obligations on Borrower and to delete obligations previously satisfied
by Borrower). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XV, Borrower shall
not be responsible or liable for any additional taxes, reserves, adjustments or
other costs and expenses that are related to, or arise as a result of, any

including, without limitation, any mortgage tax. Lender and/or the assignees, as
the case may be, shall from time to time designate one agent through which
Borrower shall request all approvals and consents required or contemplated by
this Agreement and on whose statements Borrower may rely.

assignment or participation pursuant to this Article XV, and subject to the
Securities Act or other applicable securities laws governing disclosure of

XVI.  RESERVE ACCOUNTS

      SECTION 16.1 TAX RESERVE ACCOUNT. In accordance with the time periods set
forth in Section 3.1, and during any period when the Manager is not reserving
for Impositions and Other Charges, Borrower shall deposit into the Tax Reserve
Account an amount equal to (a) one-twelfth of the annual Impositions that Lender
reasonably estimates, based on the most recent tax bill for the Property, will
be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate
with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Impositions at least twenty (20)
days prior to the imposition of any interest, charges or expenses for the
non-payment thereof and (b) one-twelfth of the annual Other Charges that Lender
reasonably estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months
(said monthly amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the MONTHLY TAX
RESERVE AMOUNT, and the aggregate amount of funds held in the Tax Reserve
Account being the TAX RESERVE AMOUNT). As of the Closing Date, the Monthly Tax
Reserve Amount is $0.00, but such amount is subject to adjustment by Lender in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 16.1. The Monthly Tax Reserve
Amount shall be paid by Borrower to Lender on each Payment Date. Lender will
apply the Monthly Tax Reserve Amount to payments of Impositions and Other
Charges required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Article V and Article VII
and under the Security Instrument, subject to Borrower's right to contest
Impositions in accordance with Section 7.3. In making any payment relating to
the Tax Reserve Account, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or
estimate procured from the appropriate public office, without inquiry into the
accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax,
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount
of funds in the Tax Reserve Account shall exceed the amounts due for Impositions
and Other Charges pursuant to Article V and Article VII, Lender shall credit
such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax Reserve Account. If at
any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax Reserve Amount is not or will
not be sufficient to pay Impositions and Other Charges by the dates set forth
above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall
increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender reasonably
estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days
prior to the imposition of any interest, charges or expenses for the non-payment
of the Impositions and Other Charges. Upon payment of the Impositions and Other
Charges, Lender shall reassess the amount necessary to be deposited in the Tax
Reserve Account for the succeeding period, which calculation shall take into
account any excess amounts remaining in the Tax Reserve Account, and any release
of a Property pursuant to Section 2.3.4 and any release of a portion of a
Property pursuant to Section 8.3.

      SECTION 16.2 INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT. Borrower has deposited on the date
hereof the amount of $0.00 in the Insurance Reserve Account. Following an
Insurance Reserve Trigger, Borrower will immediately pay to Lender for transfer
by Lender to the Insurance Reserve Account (or if Borrower fails to so pay
Lender, Lender will transfer from the Holding Account) an amount (the INSURANCE
RESERVE AMOUNT) equal to payments of insurance premiums required to be made by
Borrower to pay for the insurance required pursuant to Article VI and under the
Security Instrument. In addition, prior to such time as Borrower maintains
blanket policies of insurance in all respects satisfactory to Lender pursuant to
Section 6.1.16, and otherwise following an Insurance Reserve Trigger, in
accordance with the time periods set forth in Section 3.1, Borrower shall
deposit into the Insurance Reserve Account an amount equal to one-twelfth of the
insurance premiums that Lender reasonably estimates based on the most recent
bill, will be

                                      137
<PAGE>

payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded by the insurance policies upon
the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such insurance premiums at least twenty (20) days prior to the
expiration of the policies required to be maintained by Borrower pursuant to the
terms hereof (said monthly amounts hereinafter called the MONTHLY INSURANCE
RESERVE AMOUNT); provided, however, that immediately following an Insurance
Reserve Trigger, Borrower will pay to Lender for transfer by Lender to the
Insurance Reserve Account (or if Borrower fails to so pay Lender, Lender will
transfer from the Holding Account) an amount equal to payments of insurance
premiums required to be made by Borrower to pay for the insurance required
pursuant to Article VI and under the Security Instrument. As of the Closing
Date, the Monthly Insurance Reserve Amount is $0.00. The Monthly Insurance
Reserve Amount, if same is payable pursuant to this Section 16.2, shall be paid
by Borrower to Lender on each Payment Date. Lender will apply the Monthly
Insurance Reserve Amount and other amounts in the Insurance Reserve Account to
payments of insurance premiums required to be made by Borrower to pay (or to
reimburse Borrower or Affiliate Tenant) for the insurance required pursuant to
Article VI and under the Security Instrument. In making any payment relating to
the Insurance Reserve Account, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement
or estimate procured from the insurer or agent, without inquiry into the
accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity thereof. If at
any time Lender reasonably determines that the Insurance Reserve Amount is not
or will not be sufficient to pay insurance premiums (up to a maximum amount
equal to the aggregate annual insurance premium required hereunder), Lender
shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase the
Insurance Reserve Amount by the amount that Lender reasonably estimates is
sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days prior to
expiration of the applicable insurance policies. Upon payment of such insurance
premiums, Lender shall reassess the amount necessary to be deposited in the
Insurance Reserve Account for the succeeding period, which calculation shall
take into account any excess amounts remaining in the Insurance Reserve Account.

      SECTION 16.3 INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

      SECTION 16.4 LOW DSCR RESERVE ACCOUNTS. Following each Fiscal Quarter,
Lender will perform a DSCR Test to determine whether a Low DSCR Period has
occurred and is continuing (it being hereby agreed that all determinations as to
whether a Low DSCR Period has occurred and is continuing shall be made by Lender
based on the financial information delivered by Borrower pursuant to Section
11.2 hereof). Pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.1.1, during a Low DSCR Period, monies shall be transferred in accordance with
Section 3.1.1 hereof from the Holding Account into the applicable Low DSCR
Reserve Account and retained by Lender as additional security for the
Indebtedness and shall be applied or disbursed as hereinafter provided. From and
after the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, Lender shall have
the right to apply any amounts then remaining in the Low DSCR Reserve Accounts
to repay the Indebtedness or any other amounts due hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents in such order, manner and amount as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion. Provided no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, Lender shall instruct the Cash Management Bank to transfer in the
same manner as Excess Cash Flow any amounts remaining in the Low DSCR Reserve
Account within ten (10) Business Days after Borrower provides Lender with
evidence satisfactory to Lender indicating that the Property has achieved the
DSCR requirement set forth in subclause (ii) of the definition of Low DSCR
Period in Section 1.1 hereof.

any member whose membership deposit is in the Membership Deposit Account as of
the date hereof or is not otherwise subject to the "two year" convention
discussed in the last paragraph of attached Schedule XVII) under a Membership
Agreement at the Grand Wailea Property resigns and such member is not refunded
its membership deposit under the "4 for 1" program more particularly described
on attached Schedule XVII within forty-five (45) days after such member is
placed on the resigned list (collectively, the GRAND WAILEA REFUND MEMBERS),
Borrower shall, on the first Business Day after the expiration of such 45 day
period immediately deposit into the Grand Wailea Refund Reserve Account an
amount equal to the amount of such member's membership deposit (collectively,
GRAND WAILEA REFUND MEMBER DEPOSITS); provided, however, that Borrower shall
have no obligation to make such deposit if the aggregate membership deposits of
the Grand Wailea Refund Members then on such list is $100,000 or less.
Additionally, during any Low DSCR Period, Borrower agrees to deposit within one
(1) Business Day of receipt thereof into the Grand Wailea Refund Reserve Account
any membership deposits received during such Low DSCR Period at the Grand Wailea
Property (collectively, LOW DSCR GW MEMBERSHIP DEPOSITS). Provided no Event of
default has occurred and is continuing, funds on deposit in the Grand Wailea
Refund Reserve Account will only be released to the Borrower upon delivery to
Lender of an Officer's Certificate certifying (i) that such deposit is for a
member whose deposit is in the Grand Wailea Refund Reserve Account, (ii) the
name and address of such member, (iii) the amount of such deposit, (iv) that
such deposit has either been refunded by Borrower or is then due to be refunded
to such member and (v) if such deposit has not already been refunded by
Borrower, that Borrower will pay such refund to such member within two (2)
Business Days after receipt thereof. Borrower shall promptly send Lender copies
of all checks evidencing refunds paid out of the Grand Wailea Refund Reserve
Account. Additionally, provided no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, Lender shall instruct the Cash Management Bank to
transfer in the same manner as Excess Cash Flow free and clear of all Liens, any
amounts remaining in the Grand Wailea Refund Reserve Account that were
specifically deposited (and not previously disbursed to Borrowers) on account of
Low DSCR GW Membership Deposits (but specifically excluding any amounts
remaining in the Grand Wailea Refund Reserve Account that were deposited on
account of Grand Wailea Refund Member Deposits) within ten (10) Business Days
after Borrower provides Lender with evidence satisfactory to Lender indicating
that the Property has achieved the DSCR requirement set forth in subclause (ii)
of the definition of Low DSCR Period in Section 1.1 hereof.

      SECTION 16.9 LETTER OF CREDIT PROVISIONS.

            16.9.1 DELIVERY OF LETTER OF CREDIT. In lieu of depositing all or

amounts due pursuant to Section 16.8, Borrower shall have the right to deliver a
Letter of Credit in the amount of all or any portion of the Grand Wailea Refund

                                      139

            16.9.2 REDUCTION OF LETTER OF CREDIT. In the event that Borrower
elects to deliver the Letter of Credit to Lender under the terms of Section
16.9.1, Lender agrees to permit the reduction from time to
time of the outstanding amount of the Letter of Credit by (i) the amount of cash
funds delivered to Lender as reserve funds by Borrower in place of such Letter
of Credit, and (ii) the amount that Borrower would otherwise be entitled to
receive as a disbursement from the applicable reserve account pursuant to
Section 16.5.

            16.9.3 SECURITY FOR DEBT. Each Letter of Credit delivered under this
Agreement shall be additional security for the payment of the Indebtedness. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Lender shall have the right, at its option, to draw on any
Letter of Credit and to apply all or any part thereof to the payment of the
items for which such Letter of Credit was established or to apply each such
Letter of Credit to payment of the Indebtedness in such order, proportion or
priority as Lender may determine.

            16.9.4 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF LENDER. In addition to any other right
Lender may have to draw upon a Letter of Credit pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Lender shall have the additional
rights to draw in full any Letter of Credit: (a) if Lender has received a notice
from the issuing bank that the Letter of Credit will not be renewed and a
substitute Letter of Credit is not provided at least thirty (30) days prior to
the date on which the outstanding Letter of Credit is scheduled to expire; (b)
upon receipt of notice from the issuing bank that the Letter of Credit will be
terminated (except if a substitute Letter of Credit is provided); or (c) if
Lender has received notice that the bank issuing the Letter of Credit shall
cease to be an Approved Bank (unless an alternative Approved Bank issues an
equivalent Letter of Credit within fifteen (15) days of Borrower's receipt of
notice of same). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
above, Lender is not obligated to draw any Letter of Credit upon the happening
of an event specified in (a), (b) or (c) above and shall not be liable for any
losses sustained by Borrower due to the insolvency of the bank issuing the
Letter of Credit if Lender has not drawn the Letter of Credit.

provided further that Borrower shall have commenced to cure such Default within
such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently proceeds to cure the same,
such thirty (30) day period shall be extended for such time as is reasonably
necessary for Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such Default,
such additional period not to exceed ninety (90) days;

      (b)   Unless waived in writing by Lender, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described
in clauses (a)(vi), (vii) or (viii) above) Lender may, without notice or demand,
in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, take such action
that Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower
and in the Property, including, without limitation, (i) declaring immediately
due and payable the entire Principal Amount together with interest thereon and
all other sums due by Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) collecting
interest on the Principal Amount at the Default Rate whether or not Lender
elects to accelerate the Note and (iii) enforcing or availing itself of any or
all rights or remedies set forth in the Loan Documents against Borrower and the
Property, including, without limitation, all rights or remedies available at law
or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described in subsections (a)(vi) or
(a)(vii) above, the Indebtedness and all other obligations of Borrower hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and automatically become
due and payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives
any such notice or demand, anything contained herein or in any other Loan
Document to the contrary notwithstanding. The foregoing provisions shall not be
construed as a waiver by Lender of its right to pursue any other remedies
available to it under this Agreement, the Security Instrument or any other Loan
Document. Any payment hereunder may be enforced and recovered in whole or in
part at such time by one or more of the remedies provided to Lender in the Loan
Documents.

      SECTION 17.2 REMEDIES.

      (a)   Unless waived in writing by Lender, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights,
powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrower under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or
applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any
time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Indebtedness shall
be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any
foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and
remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to the Property. Any such
actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued
independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in
such order as Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and
remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein
or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender
shall not be subject to any one action or election of remedies law or rule and
(ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall
remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies
against the Property and the Security Instrument has been foreclosed, sold
and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of the Indebtedness or the
Indebtedness has been paid in full.

      (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, with respect to the Account Collateral, the Lender may:

            (i)   Subject to the Assignment of Management Agreement, without
notice to Borrower, except as required by law, and at any time or from time to
time, charge, set-off and otherwise apply all or any part of the Account
Collateral against the Obligations, Operating Expenses and/or Capital
Expenditures for the Property or any part thereof;

            (ii)  in Lender's sole discretion, at any time and from time to
time, exercise any and all rights and remedies available to it under this
Agreement, and/or as a secured party under the UCC;

            (iii) Subject to the Assignment of Management Agreement, demand,
collect, take possession of or receipt for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for,
foreclose or realize upon the Account Collateral (or any portion thereof) as
Lender may determine in its sole discretion; and

            (iv)  take all other actions provided in, or contemplated by, this
Agreement.

      (c)   With respect to Borrower, the Account Collateral and the Property,
nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as
requiring Lender to resort to the Property for the satisfaction of any of the
Indebtedness, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of the Property or any part
thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of the Indebtedness. In addition,
Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose this
Agreement and the Security Instrument in any manner and for any amounts secured
by this Agreement or the Security Instrument then due and payable as determined
by Lender in its sole discretion

                                      144
<PAGE>

including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event
Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or
more scheduled payments of principal or interest, Lender may foreclose this
Agreement and the Security Instrument to recover such delinquent payments, or
(ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding
principal balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose this Agreement and the
Security Instrument to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as
Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by this Agreement or the
Security Instrument as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial
foreclosures, the Property shall remain subject to this Agreement and the
Security Instrument to secure payment of sums secured by this Agreement and the
Security Instrument and not previously recovered.

      SECTION 17.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS.

            The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement and
the Security Instrument shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other
right, power or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. Lender's rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singly,
concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may
determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any
remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such
remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such
remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be
deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to
Borrower or any Guarantor shall not be construed to be a waiver of any
subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or any Guarantor or to impair
any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

      SECTION 17.4 COSTS OF COLLECTION. In the event that after an Event of
Default: (i) the Note or any of the Loan Documents is placed in the hands of an
attorney for collection or enforcement or is collected or enforced through any
legal proceeding; (ii) an attorney is retained to represent Lender in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or other proceedings affecting
creditors' rights and involving a claim under the Note or any of the Loan
Documents; or (iii) an attorney is retained to protect or enforce the lien or
any of the terms of this Agreement, the Security Instrument or any of the Loan
Documents; then Borrower shall pay to Lender all reasonable attorney's fees,
costs and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith, including costs of
appeal, together with interest on any judgment obtained by Lender at the Default
Rate.

other non-consolidation opinion delivered to Lender in connection with the Loan,
or in any other non-consolidation delivered subsequent to the closing of the
Loan, is or shall become untrue in any material respect; and

      SECTION 19.8 HEADINGS. The Article and/or Section headings and the Table
of Contents in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference
only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other
purpose.

      SECTION 19.9 SEVERABILITY. Wherever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

      SECTION 19.10 PREFERENCES. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or
part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full
force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by
Lender.

      SECTION 19.11 WAIVER OF NOTICE. Borrower shall not be entitled to any
notices of any nature whatsoever from Lender except with respect to matters for
which this Agreement or the other Loan Documents specifically and expressly
provide for the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower and except with respect
to matters for which Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements,
permitted to waive the giving of notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the
right to receive any notice from Lender with respect to any matter for which
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents do not specifically and expressly
provide for the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower.

      SECTION 19.12 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

      (a)   Except as may be otherwise expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents, Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
incurred by Lender in connection with (i) the preparation, negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the
costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without
limitation any opinions requested by Lender

                                      152
<PAGE>

pursuant to this Agreement); (ii) Lender's ongoing performance of and compliance
with all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing
Date; (iii) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and administration
of any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications to this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and any other documents or matters as required
herein or under the other Loan Documents; (iv) securing Borrower's compliance
with any requests made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; (v) the
filing and recording fees and expenses, mortgage recording taxes, title
insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for providing to Lender
all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and
perfecting the Lien in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents; (vi) enforcing or preserving any rights, in response to third
party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or
other litigation, in each case against, under or affecting Borrower, this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Property, or any other security given
for the Loan; (vii) enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments due
from Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to
the Property or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the
credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a work-out or
of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings and (viii) procuring insurance
policies pursuant to Section 6.1.11; provided, however, that Borrower shall not
be liable for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same
arise (A) by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender or (B) in connection with any action taken under Article IV
or a Securitization, other than the Borrower's internal administrative costs.
Any cost and expenses due and payable to Lender may be paid from any amounts in
the Collection Account or the Holding Account if same are not paid by Borrower
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written notice from Lender.

      (b)   Subject to the non-recourse provisions of Section 18.1, Borrower
shall protect, indemnify and save harmless Lender, and all officers, directors,
stockholders, members, partners, employees, agents, successors and assigns
thereof (collectively, the INDEMNIFIED PARTIES) from and against all
liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs
and expenses (including all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses actually
incurred) imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against the Indemnified
Parties or the Property or any part of its interest therein, by reason of the
occurrence or existence of any of the following (to the extent Proceeds payable
on account of the following shall be inadequate; it being understood that in no
event will the Indemnified Parties be required to actually pay or incur any
costs or expenses as a condition to the effectiveness of the foregoing
indemnity) prior to (i) the acceptance by Lender or its designee of a
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with respect to the Property, or (ii) an Indemnified
Party or its designee taking possession or control of the Property or (iii) the
foreclosure of the Security Instrument, except to the extent caused by the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Indemnified Parties (other than
such willful misconduct or gross negligence imputed to the Indemnified Parties
because of their interest in the Property): (1) ownership of Borrower's interest
in the Property, or any interest therein, or receipt of any Rents or other sum
therefrom, (2) any accident, injury to or death of any persons or loss of or
damage to property occurring on or about the Property or any Appurtenances
thereto, (3) any design, construction, operation, repair, maintenance, use,
non-use or condition of the Property or Appurtenances thereto, including claims
or penalties arising from violation of any Legal Requirement or Insurance
Requirement, as well as any claim based on any patent or latent defect, whether
or not discoverable by Lender,

                                      153
<PAGE>

any claim the insurance as to which is inadequate, and any Environmental Claim,
(4) any Default under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any
failure on the part of Borrower to perform or comply with any of the terms of
any Lease within the applicable notice or grace periods, (5) any performance of
any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other property in
respect of the Property or any part thereof, (6) any negligence or tortious act
or omission on the part of Borrower or any of its agents, contractors, servants,
employees, sublessees, licensees or invitees, (7) any contest referred to in
Section 7.3 hereof, (8) any obligation or undertaking relating to the
performance or discharge of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of the
landlord contained in the Leases, or (9) except as may be expressly limited
herein, the presence at, in or under the Property or the Improvements of any
Hazardous Materials in violation of any Environmental Law. Any amounts the
Indemnified Parties are legally entitled to receive under this Section which are
not paid within fifteen (15) Business Days after written demand therefor by the
Indemnified Parties or Lender, setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of
such demand and the basis therefor, shall bear interest from the date of demand
at the Default Rate, and shall, together with such interest, be part of the
Indebtedness and secured by the Security Instrument. In case any action, suit or
proceeding is brought against the Indemnified Parties by reason of any such
occurrence, Borrower shall at Borrower's expense resist and defend such action,
suit or proceeding or will cause the same to be resisted and defended by counsel
at Borrower's reasonable expense for the insurer of the liability or by counsel
designated by Borrower (unless reasonably disapproved by Lender promptly after
Lender has been notified of such counsel); provided, however, that nothing
herein shall compromise the right of Lender (or any Indemnified Party) to
appoint its own counsel at Borrower's expense for its defense with respect to
any action which in its reasonable opinion presents a conflict or potential
conflict between Lender and Borrower that would make such separate
representation advisable; provided further that if Lender shall have appointed
separate counsel pursuant to the foregoing, Borrower shall not be responsible
for the expense of additional separate counsel of any Indemnified Party unless
in the reasonable opinion of Lender a conflict or potential conflict exists
between such Indemnified Party and Lender. So long as Borrower is resisting and
defending such action, suit or proceeding as provided above in a prudent and
commercially reasonable manner, Lender and the Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to settle such action, suit or proceeding without Borrower's consent
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and claim the benefit of
this Section with respect to such action, suit or proceeding and Lender agrees
that it will not settle any such action, suit or proceeding without the consent
of Borrower; provided, however, that if Borrower is not diligently defending
such action, suit or proceeding in a prudent and commercially reasonable manner
as provided above, and Lender has provided Borrower with thirty (30) days' prior
written notice, or shorter period if mandated by the requirements of applicable
law, and opportunity to correct such determination, Lender may settle such
action, suit or proceeding and claim the benefit of this Section 19.12 with
respect to settlement of such action, suit or proceeding. Any Indemnified Party
will give Borrower prompt notice after such Indemnified Party obtains actual
knowledge of any potential claim by such Indemnified Party for indemnification
hereunder. The Indemnified Parties shall not settle or compromise any action,
proceeding or claim as to which it is indemnified hereunder without notice to
Borrower.

      SECTION 19.13 EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES INCORPORATED. The Exhibits and
Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part of this
Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

                                      154
<PAGE>

      SECTION 19.14 OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES. Any assignee of
Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan
Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets, counterclaims or
defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower may otherwise have
against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated counterclaim or
defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any action or proceeding
brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any such right to interpose
or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action
or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

      SECTION 19.15 LIABILITY OF ASSIGNEES OF LENDER. No assignee of Lender
shall have any personal liability, directly or indirectly, under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any amendment or
amendments hereto made at any time or times, heretofore or hereafter, any
different than the liability of Lender hereunder. In addition, no assignee shall
have at any time or times hereafter any personal liability, directly or
indirectly, under or in connection with or secured by any agreement, lease,
instrument, encumbrance, claim or right affecting or relating to the Property or
to which the Property is now or hereafter subject any different than the
liability of Lender hereunder. The limitation of liability provided in this
Section 19.15 is (i) in addition to, and not in limitation of, any limitation of
liability applicable to the assignee provided by law or by any other contract,
agreement or instrument, and (ii) shall not apply to any assignee's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

      SECTION 19.16 NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
      BENEFICIARIES.

      (a)   Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender.
Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership,
tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor
to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of mortgagee,
beneficiary or lender.

This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit of Lender
and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower any right
to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of any of the
obligations contained herein or therein provided, however, that it is hereby
agreed by Lender and Borrower that the provisions of Section 3.1.5 and the
provisions of Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.5 (to the extent they relate to
disbursement of funds to any Mezzanine Account and/or to pay amounts owed in
connection with the Mezzanine Loans) are intended to confer upon Mezzanine
Lenders the right to insist upon and enforce the performance and observance of
the obligation expressly set forth therein. All conditions to the obligations of
Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the
benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to require
satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to
assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of strict
compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

                                      155

      SECTION 19.17 PUBLICITY. All news releases, publicity or advertising by
Borrower or its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general
public which refers to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan
Documents, to Lender, or any of its Affiliates shall be subject to the prior
written approval of Lender.

      SECTION 19.18 WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives
all rights to a marshalling of the assets of Borrower, Borrower's shareholders
and others with interests in Borrower and of the Property, and agrees not to
assert any right under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the
sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of
estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or
affect the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Property
for the collection of the Indebtedness without any prior or different resort for
collection or of the right of Lender to the payment of the Indebtedness out of
the net proceeds of the Property in preference to every other claimant
whatsoever.

      SECTION 19.19 WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM AND OTHER ACTIONS. Borrower hereby
expressly and unconditionally waives, in connection with any suit, action or
proceeding brought by Lender on this Agreement, the Note, the Security
Instrument or any Loan Document, any and every right it may have to (i)
interpose any counterclaim therein (other than a counterclaim which can only be
asserted in the suit, action or proceeding brought by Lender on this Agreement,
the Note, the Security Instrument or any Loan Document and cannot be maintained
in a separate action) and (ii) have any such suit, action or proceeding
consolidated with any other or separate suit, action or proceeding.

      SECTION 19.20 CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE. In the event
of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the other
Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The parties
hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent counsel in connection
with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan Documents and that such
Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning
against the party which drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that, with respect
to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in
entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any statements,
representations or recommendations of Lender or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any limitation whatsoever in
the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it under any of the Loan
Documents or any other agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue
of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any
equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby
irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take any action on the
basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of any such rights or
remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real
estate financings and other real estate transactions and investments which may
be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business of Borrower or its
Affiliates.

      SECTION 19.21 PRIOR AGREEMENTS. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior
agreements among or between such parties, whether oral or written, are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
unless specifically set forth in a writing contemporaneous herewith the terms,

                                      156
<PAGE>

conditions and provisions of any and all such prior agreements do not survive
execution of this Agreement.

      SECTION 19.22 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which shall
constitute one document.

      SECTION 19.23 DISCLOSURE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Sections 14.4.1, 15.1 and 15.6, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by such Sections, in no event shall Lender deliver financial
information with respect to the Property or the Guarantor to the Persons listed
in Schedule III, without first obtaining Borrower's prior written consent;
provided however, Borrower's consent shall not be required with respect to
Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and the State of Ohio
Pension Fund if Lender delivers a confidentiality agreement from any of such
Persons reasonably acceptable to Borrower.

                                      157

            their respective successors and assigns, as of the date below, as
            follows:

            This print of survey actually was made on the ground on [INSERT DATE
            SURVEY WAS MADE] in accordance with the "Minimum Standard Detail
            Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys," jointly established
            and adopted by American Land Title Association (ALTA) and American
            Congress on Surveying & Mapping (ACSM) and National Society of
            Professional Surveyors (NSPS) in 1999, contains Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
            7(a), 7(b)(1), 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 of Table A thereto, and
            correctly shows: (i) a fixed and determinable position and location
            of the land described herein (together with the buildings and
            improvements thereon, the MORTGAGED PROPERTY), including the
            position of the point of beginning; (ii) the location of all
            buildings, structures and other improvements situated on the land;
            (iii) all driveways or other curb cuts along any street or alley
            upon which the land abuts; (iv) the location and name of all public
            and private streets or alleys located thereon or adjacent thereto,
            all of which are public unless otherwise noted; (v) the location,
            dimension and recording data of all easements, rights-of-way and
            other matters of record thereon or with respect to which the
            undersigned has knowledge; (vi) the location and dimension of all
            unrecorded easements, paths, rights-of-way and party walls to the
            extent visible thereon or with respect to which the undersigned has
            knowledge; (vii) the location of applicable building restriction and
            setback lines required by local ordinances and regulations; and
            (viii) the location of all encroachments or overhangs onto or from

<PAGE>

            visible discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary line
            conflicts. Except as shown on the survey, the Mortgaged Property
            does not serve any adjoining property for drainage, utilities or
            ingress or egress. The Mortgaged Property has access to and from a
            duly dedicated and accepted public roadway. This survey reflects
            boundary lines of the land, which "close" by engineering
            calculations. All utility services to the Mortgaged Property either
            enter the Mortgaged Property through adjoining public streets, or
            this survey shows the point of entry and location of any utilities
            which pass through or are located on adjoining private land to the
            extent visible or known to the undersigned. The Mortgaged Property
            does not lie within an area designated as a flood hazard area by any
            map or publication of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
            Development or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The
            Mortgaged Property and only the Mortgaged Property constitutes one
            tax lot. All zoning use and density classifications are properly
            shown hereon. The undersigned has received and examined a copy of
            the Commitment for Title Insurance No. __________, dated __________,
            issued by _____________________________, with respect to the
            Mortgaged Property, as well as a copy of each instrument listed
            therein. The location of each exception set forth in such
            Commitment, to the extent it can be located, has (with recording
            reference and reference to the exception number of the Commitment)
            been shown hereon. The undersigned further certifies that this
            survey meets the Accuracy Standards (as adopted by ALTA, ACSM and
            NSPS and in effect on the date of this certification) and [SELECT

                  and promoted by the Corporation, is to engage solely in the
                  following activities:

                  (a) To acquire that certain parcel of real property, together
            with all improvements located thereon, in the City of ____________,
            State of ___________ [_________ interests in [insert Borrower or
            other applicable entity's name]] (the Property).

                  (b) To own, hold, sell, assign, transfer, operate, lease,
            mortgage, pledge and otherwise deal with the Property.

                  (c) To exercise all powers enumerated in the [General
            Corporation Law] of ______________ necessary or convenient to the
            conduct, promotion or attainment of the business or purposes
            otherwise set forth herein.

      B. Certain Prohibited Activities

<PAGE>

                        The corporation shall be prohibited, except in certain
                  circumstances, from engaging in certain activities, including
                  various types of insolvency proceedings, dissolution,
                  liquidation, consolidation, merger, sale of all or
                  substantially all of the corporation's assets, transfer of
                  ownership assets, incurrence of additional debt and amendment
                  of the corporation's articles of incorporation.

                        "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other
                  document governing the formation, management or operation of
                  the Corporation to the contrary, the following shall govern:

                  State or the District of Columbia, (b) shall include in its
                  organizational documents the same limitations set forth in
                  this Article _______ and in Article [insert section setting

                  agreement to which it is a party shall have been committed by

                  special purpose entity, all of its general partners shall be
                  special purpose entities. If such limited partnership has more

                  continue (and not dissolve) for so long as a solvent general
                  partner exists. Consequently, both the limited partnership's
                  partnership agreement and the certificate of incorporation of

                  other director of the Partnership or of the managing member of
                  the Partnership. As used herein, the term "control" means the
                  possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or
                  cause the direction of the management and policies of a person
                  or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by
                  contract or otherwise.

            5.    Dissolution

                  The limited partnership agreement should provide that the
                  partnership will continue (and not dissolve) so long as a
                  solvent general partner exists.

                        "Notwithstanding any provision or of any other document
                        governing the formation, management or operation of the
                        Partnership hereof to the contrary, the following shall
                        govern: The Partnership shall not terminate solely as a

                        general partners of the Partnership so long as there
                        remains a solvent general partner of the Partnership."

                  In addition, dissolution of the partnership must not occur so
                  long as the partnership remains mortgagor of the mortgaged
                  properly.

                        "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other
                        document governing the formation, management or
                        operation of the Partnership to the contrary, the
                        following shall govern: Subject to applicable law,
                        dissolution of the Partnership shall not occur so long
                        as the Partnership remains mortgagor of the [Property]
                        [use other term for the real estate if necessary]."

                  document governing the formation, management or operation of
                  the Corporation to the contrary, the following shall govern:

                  federal or state statute without the unanimous consent of the
                  Board of Directors. For so long as a mortgage lien exists on
                  the Property, (i) no amendment to this certificate of

                  "The Board of Directors may not take any action requiring the
                  unanimous affirmative vote of 100% of the members of the Board
                  of Directors unless all directors including the Independent
                  Directors shall have participated in such vote."

            3.    Indemnification

                  Indemnification of a corporation's directors and officers
                  should be fully subordinated to obligations respecting the
                  Property.

                  "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other document
                  governing the formation, management or operation of the
                  Corporation to the contrary, the following shall govern: Any

                  respecting the Partnership or the Property and shall not
                  constitute a claim against the Corporation in the event that
                  cash flow is insufficient to pay such obligations."

            4.    Separateness Covenants

                  In order to demonstrate that it is a bankruptcy remote entity
                  not at risk of having its assets substantively consolidated
                  with those of another entity, the Corporation must observe
                  certain covenants designed to make evident the special purpose
                  entity's separateness from its affiliates.

                  "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other document
                  governing the formation, management or operation of the
                  Corporation to the contrary, the following shall govern: For

                  (c) Its Board of Directors shall hold appropriate meetings (or
            act by unanimous consent) to authorize all appropriate corporate
            actions, and in authorizing such actions, shall observe all
            corporate formalities. The Board of Directors shall include at least
            two (2) individuals who are Independent Directors. As used herein,
            an "Independent Director" shall mean an individual who shall not
            have been at the time of such individual's appointment, and may not
            have been at any time (i) a partner, member, shareholder of, or an

            Corporation or of the managing member of the Corporation. As used
            herein, the term "control" means the possession, directly or
            indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the

                        For purpose of this Article _____________, the following
                  terms shall have the following meanings:

                        "affiliate" means any person controlling or controlled
                  by or under common control with the parent, including, without

                  thereof and (ii) any person which receives compensation for
                  administrative, legal or accounting services from this
                  corporation, its parent or any affiliate. For purposes of this
                  definition, "control" when used with respect to any specified
                  person, means the power to direct the management and policies
                  of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the
                  ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and
                  the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings
                  correlative to the foregoing.

                        "parent" means, with respect to a corporation, any other
                  corporation owning or controlling, directly or indirectly,

                  unincorporated organization, or government or any agency or
                  political subdivision thereof.

III.  LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY

                  If the Single Purpose Entity is a limited liability company,
                  to be a special purpose entity, each managing member shall be
                  a special purpose corporation. If such limited liability
                  company has more than one managing member then such limited
                  liability company shall continue (and not dissolve) for so
                  long as a solvent managing member exists. Consequently, both
                  the Limited Liability Company's articles of organization and
                  the certificate of incorporation of its outside member will
                  have to meet certain requirements to be considered special
                  purpose entities. Such requirements are as follows:

                  assets, transfer of limited liability company interests,
                  incurrence of additional debt and amendment of the articles of
                  organization.

                  "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other document
                  governing the formation, management or operation of the
                  Limited Liability Company to the contrary, the following shall
                  govern: The Limited Liability Company shall only incur

                        Indemnification of a limited liability company's
                        partners should be fully subordinated to obligations
                        respecting the Property.

                        "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other
                        document governing the formation, management or

            4.    Separateness Covenants

                        entity not at risk of having its assets substantively
                        consolidated with those of another entity, the limited
                        liability company must observe certain covenants
                        designed to make evident the special purpose entity's
                        separateness from its affiliates.

            5.    Dissolution

                  To the extent permitted by tax law the articles of
                  organization should provide that the vote of a
                  majority-in-interest of the remaining members is sufficient to
                  continue the life of the limited liability company. If such

                        permissible under applicable federal and state tax law,
                        the vote of a majority-in-interest of the remaining
                        members is sufficient to continue the life of the
                        Limited Liability Company. If such vote is not obtained,
                        for so long as a mortgage lien exists on the [Property]

                        [Property] [use other term for the real estate if
                        necessary]. Such holders may continue to exercise all of
                        their rights under the existing security agreements or
                        mortgages until the debt underlying the mortgage liens
                        has been paid in full or otherwise completely
                        discharged.

                        federal or state statute without the unanimous consent
                        of the Board of Directors. For so long as a mortgage
                        lien exists on the Property, without first obtaining
                        approval of the mortgagee holding a first mortgage lien
                        on the Property (i) no material amendment to this
                        certificate of incorporation or to the Corporation's
                        By-Laws nor to the articles of organization of the
                        Limited Liability Company may be made and (ii) neither
                        the Corporation nor the Limited Liability Company shall
                        dissolve, liquidate or terminate without first obtaining
                        approval of the mortgagee holding a first mortgage lien
                        on the Property."

                        "The Board of Directors may not take any action
                        requiring the unanimous affirmative vote of 100% of the
                        members of the Board of Directors unless all directors
                        including the Independent Directors shall have
                        participated in such vote."

            3.    Indemnification

                        Indemnification of a corporation's directors and
                        officers should be fully subordinated to obligations
                        respecting the Property.

                        "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other
                        document governing the formation, management or
                        operation of the Corporation to the contrary, the
                        following shall govern: Any indemnification shall be
                        fully subordinated to any obligations respecting the
                        Limited Liability Company or the Property and shall not
                        constitute a claim against the Corporation in the event
                        that cash flow is insufficient to pay such obligations."

            4.    Separateness Covenants

                  In order to demonstrate that it is a bankruptcy remote entity
                  not at risk of having its assets substantively consolidated
                  with those of another entity, the corporation must observe
                  certain covenants designed to make evident the special purpose
                  entity's separateness from its affiliates.

                  "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other document
                  governing the formation, management or operation of the
                  Corporation to the contrary, the following shall govern: For
                  so long as any mortgage lien

                  other provisions set forth in this certificate of
                  incorporation, the Corporation shall conduct its affairs in

                  (a) It shall establish and maintain an office through which

            act by unanimous consent) to authorize all appropriate corporate
            actions, and in authorizing such actions, shall observe all

            two (2) individuals who are Independent Directors. As used herein,
            an "Independent Director" shall mean an individual who shall not
            have been at the time of such individual's appointment, and may not
            have been at any time (i) a partner, member, shareholder of, or an
            officer or employee of, the Corporation or any of its respective
            partners, members, shareholders, subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) a
            customer of, or supplier to, the Corporation or managing member of
            the Corporation or any of their respective partners, members,
            shareholders, subsidiaries or affiliates, (iii) a person controlling
            any such partner, member, shareholder, supplier or customer, or (iv)
            a member of the immediate family of any such shareholder, officer,
            employee, supplier or customer of any other director of the
            Corporation or of the managing member of the Corporation. As used
            herein, the term "control" means the possession, directly or
            indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
            management and policies of a person or entity, whether through
            ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

            contemplated business operations.

<PAGE>

                  (j) It shall not guarantee or become obligated for the debts
            of any other entity, including its parent or any affiliate or hold
            out its credit as being available to satisfy the obligations of
            others.

                  (k) It shall not acquire obligations or securities of its
            partners, members or shareholders.

                  (l) It shall use stationery, invoices and checks separate from

                  (m) It shall not pledge its assets for the benefit of any

            loans or advances to any other person.

                  (n) It shall hold itself out as an entity separate from its
            parent and any affiliate.

                  (o) It shall correct any known misunderstanding regarding its
            separate identity."

                        For purpose of this Article ______, the following terms
                  shall have the following meanings:

                        "affiliate" means any person controlling or controlled
                  by or under common control with the parent, including, without
                  limitation (i) any person who has a familial relationship, by
                  blood, marriage or otherwise with any director, officer or
                  employee of the Corporation, its parent, or any affiliate
                  thereof and (ii) any person which receives compensation for
                  administrative, legal or accounting services from this
                  corporation, its parent or any affiliate. For purposes of this
                  definition, "control" when used with respect to any specified
                  person, means the power to direct the management and policies
                  of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the
                  ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and
                  the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings
                  correlative to the foregoing.

                        "parent" means, with respect to a corporation, any other
                  corporation owning or controlling, directly or indirectly,
                  fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting stock of the
                  Corporation.

                        "person means any individual, corporation, partnership,
                  limited liability company, joint venture, association, joint
                  stock company, trust (including any beneficiary thereof),
                  unincorporated organization, or government or any agency or
                  political subdivision thereof.

            5.    Voting

                                      C-22
<PAGE>

                  When voting on matters concerning the limited liability
                  company, notwithstanding that the limited liability company is
                  not then insolvent, the Corporation must take into account the
                  interest of the Limited Liability Company's creditors, as well
                  as those of its members.

                  "Notwithstanding any provision hereof or of any other document
                  governing the formation, management or operation of the
                  Corporation to the contrary, the following shall govern: When
                  voting on matters concerning the Limited Liability Company,
                  notwithstanding that the Limited Liability Company is not then
                  insolvent, the Corporation shall take into account the
                  interest of the Limited Liability Company's creditors, as well
                  as those of its members."

IV. OTHER STRUCTURES

            The foregoing provisions do not exhaustively contemplate all
            ownership structures for a mortgaged property. Situations involving
            ownership structures not specifically contemplated by the provisions
            set forth on this Exhibit C shall nevertheless require Single
            Purpose Entities substantively to comply with the requirements to
            these provisions, modified as appropriate to accommodate the
            ownership structure in question.

                                    EXHIBIT D

                       ENFORCEABILITY OPINION REQUIREMENTS

      1. The Opinion shall be delivered on the Closing Date and shall satisfy
all applicable requirements of the Rating Agencies in relation thereto.

      2. The Opinion shall be given by a professional law firm selected by
Borrower and reasonably acceptable to Lender.

      3. The Opinion shall be in form and substance acceptable to Lender and
shall be given in relation to Borrower, Guarantor, Manager and any other
relevant party to the Loan (each a "Loan Party"). Depending on the nature of the
transaction, the Opinion shall address the applicable law of the State of New
York, the State where the Property is located and each State where any Loan
Party is organized (collectively, the "Relevant States"). To the extent that the
Property is located in a jurisdiction outside of the State of New York and/or
any Loan Party is organized under a jurisdiction outside the State of New York,
the appropriate opinions below should be given by local counsel. The Opinion
shall be given on the basis of an examination of an executed original of each
completed Loan Document in addition to such other documents or instruments
counsel deems relevant.

      4. The Opinion shall contain the following opinions:

      (a)   Each Loan Party is a [Describe Legal Form] duly organized, validly
            existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of [State
            of Organization] and is authorized to do business and in good
            standing in each Relevant State.

      (b)   Each Loan Party has the requisite power to own its properties and to
            carry on its business as now being conducted.

      (c)   The execution and delivery by each Loan Party of each Loan Document
            to which it is a party has been duly authorized by all necessary
            partnership, company and/or corporate action, as applicable. To the
            extent a party thereto, the Loan Documents have been duly executed
            and delivered by each Loan Party.

      (d)   The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the
            Loan Documents to which it is a party does not:

                  i.    conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
                        conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default
                        under, the partnership agreement, partnership
                        certificate, articles of incorporation, by-laws, trust
                        agreement or trust certificate, as applicable, of such
                        Loan Party;

                  ii.   contravene any law, statute or regulation of the United
                        States of America or the Relevant States or any agency
                        or political subdivision of either thereof;


                                      D-1
<PAGE>

                  iii.  violate any order, writ, injunction, or decree of which,
                        after due inquiry, counsel has actual knowledge, issued
                        by any court or governmental authority of the United
                        States of America or the Relevant States or any agency
                        or political subdivision of either thereof to which such
                        Loan Party is subject; or

                  iv.   conflict with or result in any breach of any of the
                        terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under,
                        or result in the creation or imposition of (or the
                        obligation to create or impose) any lien other than the
                        lien of the Security Instrument and the Assignment of
                        Leases upon any of the assets or properties of such Loan
                        Party pursuant to the terms of any material indenture,
                        mortgage, deed of trust, agreement, contract or
                        instrument to which such Loan Party is a party or by
                        which it or any of its assets or properties is bound.

      (e)   To the extent a party thereto, the Loan Documents are the legal,
            valid and binding obligations of each Loan Party, enforceable
            against such Loan Party in accordance with their terms.

      (f)   The Security Instrument is in proper form so as to comply with
            recording requirements of the State of [Location of Property], and
            upon recordation of the Security Instrument in the office of the
            [Recorder's Office] (the "Recording Office"), the Security
            Instrument will create in favor of Lender valid and perfected liens
            on the Property, securing payment of the obligations purported to be
            secured thereby, and no further action will be required to perfect
            such liens. The Security Instrument grants to Lender a valid and
            perfected security interest in the fixtures described therein. The
            Security Instrument contains such rights and remedies in favor of
            Lender as are customarily found in [mortgages/deeds of trust/deeds
            to secure debt] recorded in the State of [Location of Property].

      (g)   The Assignment of Leases is in proper form so as to comply with the
            recording requirements of the State of [Location of Property]. At
            the time the Assignment of Leases is delivered to the Recording
            Office for recording, it will take effect as to all creditors and
            subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice,
            and it shall be entitled to priority over any other similar
            instrument delivered to said Recording Office for recording after
            that time, in the absence of actual notice.

      (h)   The Financing Statements are in proper form so as to comply with the
            filing requirements of the State of [Location of Property] and, upon
            filing of the Financing Statements in the office of the Secretary of
            State and the Recording Office and the appropriate Recording Office
            (the "UCC Filing Offices"), the Financing Statements will perfect
            the lien in favor of Lender, created by the Security Instrument on
            the fixtures, equipment, inventory, accounts, chattel paper and
            general intangibles described therein.

                                      D-2
<PAGE>

      (i)   Borrower has paid all recording tax due in connection with the
            recording of the Security Instrument and the Assignment of Leases.
            No additional deed of trust recording, intangibles tax, documentary
            stamp tax or similar taxes or charges, other than nominal
            recordation or filing fees, are required to be paid as a condition
            of the legality of enforceability of the Security Instrument or the
            Assignment of Leases.

      (j)   The Loan and Security Agreement is effective to create in favor of
            Lender a valid and perfected security interest under the UCC
            (including the UCC as made applicable to any security entitlements
            with respect to book-entry securities (as such term is defined in 31
            CFR Section 357.2) pursuant to 31 CFR Section 357.11) in all of
            Borrower's right, title and interest in the security entitlements in
            the Securities Accounts. Such security interest has priority under
            the UCC over any conflicting security interest under the UCC.
            "Security entitlement" has the meaning set forth in Section
            8-102(a)(17) of the UCC with respect to "financial assets" (as
            defined in Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC) and the meaning set forth
            in 31 CFR Section 357.2 with respect to "book-entry securities" (as
            defined in 31 CFR Section 357.2).

      (k)   The provisions of the Security Instrument are effective to create,
            in favor of Lender to secure the obligations purported to be secured
            thereby, a valid security interest in Borrower's rights in that
            portion of the collateral which is subject to Article 9 of the UCC
            (the "UCC Collateral").

      (l)   The State of [Location of Property] has no law pursuant to which a
            lien against any assets or properties of Borrower (whether real,
            personal, mixed, tangible or intangible) superior to the lien
            created by the Security Instrument could arise as a result of a
            violation of environmental laws or regulations of such State. No
            environmental law or regulation of the State of [Location of
            Property] would require any remedial or removal action or
            certification of nonapplicability as a condition to the granting of
            the Security Instrument, the foreclosure or other enforcement of the
            Loan Documents or the sale of any assets or properties of Borrower
            (whether real, personal, mixed, tangible or intangible) located in
            the State of [Location of Property].

      (m)   No order, consent, approval, license or authorization of, or filing,
            recording or registration with, any governmental or public body or
            authority of the United States of America or the Relevant States or
            any agency or political subdivision of either thereof is required in
            connection with the execution and delivery of any of the Loan
            Documents, the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of
            the Loan Documents or the consummation of the transactions
            contemplated thereby.

      (n)   There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any court,
            governmental or regulatory authority or agency of which, after due
            inquiry, we have actual knowledge pending or threatened against or
            affecting any Loan Party or Borrower's rights with respect to the
            Property wherein an adverse ruling or decision, individually or
            collectively with other such actions, suits or proceedings, is
            reasonably likely (i) to affect materially and adversely the ability
            of any Loan

                                      D-3
<PAGE>

            Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Loan
            Documents or to perform its obligations under any of the Loan
            Documents, or (ii) to result in a challenge to the legality,
            validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan
            Documents.

      (o)   No approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
            governmental authority of the United States of America or the
            Relevant States of is required for the valid execution, delivery and
            performance by any Borrower Party of any of the Loan Documents.

      (p)   Based upon facts of which counsel has actual knowledge, the
            transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents do not constitute a
            fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or a preferential
            transfer under the laws of the Relevant States, so long as the
            conveyances are made for adequate consideration and in good faith.

      (q)   The payment by Borrower and receipt by Lender of all principal and
            interest and other payments required to be paid pursuant to the
            terms of the Note and the other Loan Documents (including, without
            limitation, the provisions for interest after default and late
            charges) will not violate the usury laws of the Relevant States or
            otherwise constitute unlawful interest.

      (r)   Lender is not required to register as a foreign entity or qualify to
            do business in the State of [Location of Property] solely by reason
            of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

      (s)   Lender will not become subject to any fees, charges or income,
            franchise or other tax imposed by the State of [Location of
            Property] or be required to obtain any license, approval, or
            authorization in the State of [Location of Property] solely by
            reason of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                     NON-CONSOLIDATION OPINION REQUIREMENTS

            1. The Nonconsolidation Opinion shall be delivered on the Closing
Date and shall satisfy all applicable requirements of the Rating Agencies in
relation thereto.

            2. The Nonconsolidation Opinion shall be given by a professional law
firm selected by Borrower and reasonably acceptable to Lender.

            3. The Nonconsolidation Opinion shall be in form and substance
acceptable to Lender and shall be given in relation to both Borrower and any
other SPE Entity relevant to the Loan. The Nonconsolidation Opinion shall
identify each entity (a "Relevant Entity") which owns more than a 49% direct or
indirect interest in either Borrower and/or such SPE Entity. Depending on the
circumstances and nature of the transaction structure, a non-affiliated entity,
such as a third party property manager, shall be included as a Relevant Entity
if required by the Rating Agencies.

            4. The Nonconsolidation Opinion shall state that, in the event that
any Relevant Entity were to be a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code, it
is counsel's opinion that, under present reported decisional authority and
statutes applicable to federal bankruptcy cases, in a properly presented and
argued case, a court would not, in the proper exercise of its equitable
discretion, disregard the separate existence of Borrower or any SPE Entity so as
to order substantive consolidation under the Bankruptcy Code of the assets and
liabilities of such Relevant Entity with the assets and liabilities of either
Borrower or any SPE Entity and treat such assets and liabilities as though
either Borrower and such Relevant Entity or any SPE Entity and such Relevant
Entity were one entity.

            5. The Nonconsolidation Opinion shall be addressed to Lender and its
successors and assigns and shall state that it may be relied upon by (i) any
assignee of Lender's interest in the Loan, (ii) any participant of Lender's
interest in the Loan, (iii) any servicer of the Loan, (iv) any purchaser of the
Loan or any portion thereof in any Securitization, (v) any Rating Agency
involved in a Securitization of the Loan, (vi) the issuer of securities in a
Securitization of the Loan, and (vii) any trustee or servicer appointed in
connection with a Securitization of the Loan.

            The ASSIGNOR and the ASSIGNEE referred to on Schedule 1 attached
hereto agree as follows:

            1. The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the Assignee, and the

attached hereto. After giving effect to such sale and assignment, the amount of
the Loan and the Note owing to the Assignee will be as set forth on Schedule 1
attached hereto.

            2. The Assignor (i) represents and warrants that it is the legal and
beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such

created or purported to be created under or in connection with the Loan
Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (iii)

the principal amount of the Loan assumed by the Assignee pursuant hereto and the
Assignor in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Loan retained by the
Assignor under the Note and the Loan Agreement, respectively, as specified on
Schedule 1 attached hereto.

            3. The Assignee (i) confirms that it has received a copy of the Note
and the Loan Agreement, together with such financial statements and other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) agrees

as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Loan
Documents as are delegated to Lender by the terms thereof, together with such
powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (iv) agrees that

provided in the Loan Agreement and this Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish
its rights and be released from its obligations under the Loan Agreement and the
Note.

Effective Date, Lender shall make all payments under the Loan Agreement and the
Note or notes in respect of the interest assigned hereby (including, without
limitation, all payments of principal, interest and commitment fees with respect
thereto) to the Assignee. The Assignor and Assignee shall make all appropriate

            7. This Assignment and Acceptance shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

            8. This Assignment and Acceptance may be executed in any number of

which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of Schedule 1 to this Assignment and Acceptance by telecopier shall

and Acceptance.

                                      * * *

            THIS AGREEMENT made as of this ___ day of _____, 200_, between
GERMAN AMERICAN CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation, having an address
at 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005 (hereinafter called "Lender"), and
________, a __________________, having an address at __________________
(hereinafter called "Tenant").

                                   WITNESSETH:

            WHEREAS, by a lease (the "Original Lease") dated ________, 200_
between _______________ (hereinafter called "Landlord"), as landlord, and
Tenant, as tenant, as amended by lease amendment[s] dated ______, 200_,
[_________, 200_ and _________, 200_] (the Original Lease, as so amended, is
hereinafter the "Lease"), a memorandum of which Lease was dated ____ and was
recorded in __________ in Reel ______, Page ___, [add recording data for
memoranda of amendments, if applicable], Landlord leased to Tenant certain
premises located in ___________________________(the "Premises") on the property
described in Schedule "A" annexed hereto and made a part hereof (the
"Property"); and

            WHEREAS, Lender is about to make a loan to Landlord, which loan
shall be secured by, among other things, a mortgage or deed of trust (which
mortgage or deed of trust, and all amendments, renewals, increases,
modifications, replacements, substitutions, extensions, spreaders and
consolidations thereof and all re-advances thereunder and addictions thereto, is
referred to as the "Security Instrument") encumbering the Property; and

            WHEREAS, Lender and Tenant desire to confirm their understanding and
agreement with respect to the Lease and the Security Instrument.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, Lender and Tenant hereby agree and covenant as
follows:

            1. The Lease, and all of the terms, covenants, provisions and
conditions thereof (including, without limitation, any right of first refusal,
right of first offer, option or any similar right with respect to the sale or
purchase of the Property, or any portion thereof) is, shall be and shall at all
times remain and continue to be subject and subordinate in all respects to the
lien, terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of the Security Instrument and
to all advances and re-advances made thereunder and all sums secured thereby.
This provision shall be self-operative but Tenant shall execute and deliver any
additional instruments which Lender may reasonably require to effect such
subordination.

            2. So long as (i) Tenant is not in default (beyond any period given
in the Lease to Tenant to cure such default) in the payment of rent, percentage
rent or additional rent or in the performance or observance of any of the other
terms, covenants, provisions or conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be
performed or observed, (ii) Tenant is not in default under this Agreement and
(iii) the Lease is in full force and effect: (a) Tenant's possession of the
Premises and Tenant's rights and privileges under the Lease, or any extensions
or renewals thereof which may be effected in accordance with any option therefor
which is contained in the Lease, shall not

                                      K-2
<PAGE>

be diminished or interfered with by Lender, and Tenant's occupancy of the
Premises shall not be disturbed by Lender for any reason whatsoever during the
term of the Lease or any such extensions or renewals thereof and (b) Lender will
not join Tenant as a party defendant in any action or proceeding to foreclose
the Security Instrument or to enforce any rights or remedies of Lender under the
Security Instrument which would cut-off, destroy, terminate or extinguish the
Lease or Tenant's interest and estate under the Lease (except to the extent
required so that Tenant's right to receive or set-off any monies or obligations
owed or to be performed by any of Lender's predecessors-in-interest shall not be
enforceable thereafter against Lender or any of Lender's
successors-in-interest). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, if it would be procedurally disadvantageous for Lender not to name or
join Tenant as a party in a foreclosure proceeding with respect to the Security
Instrument, Lender may so name or join Tenant without in any way diminishing or
otherwise affecting the rights and privileges granted to, or inuring to the
benefit of, Tenant under this Agreement.

            3. (A) After notice is given by Lender that the Security Instrument
is in default and that the rentals under the Lease should be paid to Lender,
Tenant will attorn to Lender and pay to Lender, or pay in accordance with the
directions of Lender, all rentals and other monies due and to become due to
Landlord under the Lease or otherwise in respect of the Premises. Such payments
shall be made regardless of any right of set-off, counterclaim or other defense
which Tenant may have against Landlord, whether as the tenant under the Lease or
otherwise.

               (A) In addition, if Lender (or its nominee or designee) shall
succeed to the rights of Landlord under the Lease through possession or
foreclosure action, delivery of a deed or otherwise, or another person purchases
the Property or the portion thereof containing the Premises upon or following
foreclosure of the Security Instrument or in connection with any bankruptcy case
commenced by or against Landlord, then at the request of Lender (or its nominee
or designee) or such purchaser (Lender, its nominees and designees, and such
purchaser, and their respective successors and assigns, each being a
"Successor-Landlord"), Tenant shall attorn to and recognize Successor-Landlord
as Tenant's landlord under the Lease and shall promptly execute and deliver any
instrument that Successor-Landlord may reasonably request to evidence such
attornment. Upon such attornment, the Lease shall continue in full force and
effect as, or as if it were, a direct lease between Successor-Landlord and
Tenant upon all terms, conditions and covenants as are set forth in the Lease.
If the Lease shall have terminated by operation of law or otherwise as a result
of or in connection with a bankruptcy case commenced by or against Landlord or a
foreclosure action or proceeding or delivery of a deed in lieu, upon request of
Successor-Landlord, Tenant shall promptly execute and deliver a direct lease
with Successor-Landlord which direct lease shall be on substantially the same
terms and conditions as the Lease (subject, however, to the provisions of
clauses (i)-(v) of this paragraph 3(B)) and shall be effective as of the day the
Lease shall have terminated as aforesaid. Notwithstanding the continuation of
the Lease, the attornment of Tenant thereunder or the execution of a direct
lease between Successor-Landlord and Tenant as aforesaid, Successor-Landlord
shall not:

               (ii) be liable for any previous act or omission of Landlord
under the Lease;

                                      K-3

               (iii) be subject to any off-set, defense or counterclaim which
shall have theretofore accrued to Tenant against Landlord;

               (iv) be bound by any modification of the Lease or by any previous
prepayment of rent or additional rent made more than one (1) month prior to the
date same was due which Tenant might have paid to Landlord, unless such
modification or prepayment shall have been expressly approved in writing by
Lender;

               (v) be liable for any security deposited under the Lease unless
such security has been physically delivered to Lender or Successor-Landlord; and

               (vi) be liable or obligated to comply with or fulfill any of the
obligations of the Landlord under the Lease or any agreement relating thereto
with respect to the construction of, or payment for, improvements on or above
the Premises (or any portion thereof), leasehold improvements, tenant work
letters and/or similar items.

            4. Tenant agrees that without the prior written consent of Lender,
it shall not (a) amend, modify, terminate or cancel the Lease or any extensions
or renewals thereof, (b) tender a surrender of the Lease, (c) make a prepayment
of any rent or additional rent more than one (1) month in advance of the due
date thereof, or (d) subordinate or permit the subordination of the Lease to any
lien subordinate to the Security Instrument. Any such purported action without
such consent shall be void as against the holder of the Security Instrument.

            5. (A) Tenant shall promptly notify Lender of any default by
Landlord under the Lease and of any act or omission of Landlord which would give
Tenant the right to cancel or terminate the Lease or to claim a partial or total
eviction.

               (B) In the event of a default by Landlord under the Lease which
would give Tenant the right, immediately or after the lapse of a period of time,
to cancel or terminate the Lease or to claim a partial or total eviction, or in
the event of any other act or omission of Landlord which would give Tenant the
right to cancel or terminate the Lease, Tenant shall not exercise such right (i)
until Tenant has given written notice of such default, act or omission to Lender
and (ii) unless Lender has failed, within sixty (60) days after Lender receives
such notice, to cure or remedy the default, act or omission or, if such default,
act or omission shall be one which is not reasonably capable of being remedied
by Lender within such sixty (60) day period, until a reasonable period for
remedying such default, act or omission shall have elapsed following the giving
of such notice and following the time when Lender shall have become entitled
under the Security Instrument to remedy the same (which reasonable period shall
in no event be less than the period to which Landlord would be entitled under
the Lease or otherwise, after similar notice, to effect such remedy), provided
that Lender shall with due diligence give Tenant written notice of its intention
to and shall commence and continue to, remedy such default, act or omission. If
Lender cannot reasonably remedy a default, act or omission of Landlord until
after Lender obtains possession of the Premises, Tenant may not terminate or
cancel the Lease or claim a partial or total eviction by reason of such default,
act or omission until the expiration of a reasonable period necessary for the
remedy after Lender secures possession of the Premises. To the extent Lender
incurs any expenses or other costs in curing or

                                      K-4
<PAGE>

remedying such default, act or omission, including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees and disbursements, Lender shall be subrogated to Tenant's rights
against Landlord.

               (C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender shall have no
obligation hereunder to remedy such default, act or omission.

            6. To the extent that the Lease shall entitle Tenant to notice of
the existence of any mortgage and the identity of any mortgagee or any ground
lessor, this Agreement shall constitute such notice to Tenant with respect to
the Security Instrument and Lender.

            7. Upon and after the occurrence of a default under the Security
Instrument, which is not cured after any applicable notice and/or cure periods,
Lender shall be entitled, but not obligated, to exercise the claims, rights,
powers, privileges and remedies of Landlord under the Lease and shall be further
entitled to the benefits of, and to receive and enforce performance of, all of
the covenants to be performed by Tenant under the Lease as though Lender were
named therein as Landlord.

            8. Anything herein or in the Lease to the contrary notwithstanding,
in the event that a Successor-Landlord shall acquire title to the Property or
the portion thereof containing the Premises, Successor-Landlord shall have no
obligation, nor incur any liability, beyond Successor-Landlord's then interest,
if any, in the Property, and Tenant shall look exclusively to such interest, if
any, of Successor-Landlord in the Property for the payment and discharge of any
obligations imposed upon Successor-Landlord hereunder or under the Lease, and
Successor-Landlord is hereby released or relieved of any other liability
hereunder and under the Lease. Tenant agrees that, with respect to any money
judgment which may be obtained or secured by Tenant against Successor-Landlord,
Tenant shall look solely to the estate or interest owned by Successor-Landlord
in the Property, and Tenant will not collect or attempt to collect any such
judgment out of any other assets of Successor-Landlord.

            9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Lease, Tenant
agrees for the benefit of Landlord and Lender that, except as permitted by, and
fully in accordance with, applicable law, Tenant shall not generate, store,
handle, discharge or maintain in, on or about any portion of the Property, any
asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, or any other hazardous or toxic materials,
wastes and substances which are defined, determined or identified as such
(including, but not limited to, pesticides and petroleum products if they are
defined, determined or identified as such) in any federal, state or local laws,
rules or regulations (whether now existing or hereafter enacted or promulgated)
or any judicial or administrative interpretation of any thereof, including any
judicial or administrative interpretation of any thereof, including any judicial
or administrative orders or judgments.

            10. If the Lease provides that Tenant is entitled to expansion
space, Successor-Landlord shall have no obligation nor any liability for failure
to provide such expansion space if a prior landlord (including, without
limitation, Landlord), by reason of a lease or leases entered into by such prior
landlord with other tenants of the Property, has precluded the availability of
such expansion space.

                                      K-5
<PAGE>

            11. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, Lender shall
not, by virtue of this Agreement, the Security Instrument or any other
instrument to which Lender may be a party, be or become subject to any liability
or obligation to Tenant under the Lease or otherwise.

            12. (A) Tenant acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement satisfies
and complies in all respects with the provisions of Article __ of the Lease and
that this Agreement supersedes (but only to the extent inconsistent with) the
provisions of such Article and any other provision of the Lease relating to the
priority or subordination of the Lease and the interests or estates created
thereby to the Security Instrument.

                (B) Tenant agrees to enter into a subordination, non-disturbance
and attornment agreement with any lender which shall succeed Lender as lender
with respect to the Property, or any portion thereof, provided such agreement is
substantially similar to this Agreement. Tenant does herewith irrevocably
appoint and constitute Lender as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact in its
name, place and stead to execute such subordination, non-disturbance and
attornment agreement, without any obligation on the part of Lender to do so.
This power, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable as long as the
Indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument remains unpaid. Lender agrees
not to exercise its rights under the preceding two sentences if Tenant promptly
enters into the subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement as
required pursuant to the first sentence of this subparagraph (B).

            13. (A) Any notice required or permitted to be given by Tenant to
Landlord shall be simultaneously given also to Lender, and any right to Tenant
dependent upon notice shall take effect only after notice is so given.
Performance by Lender shall satisfy any conditions of the Lease requiring
performance by Landlord, and Lender shall have a reasonable time to complete
such performance as provided in Paragraph 5 hereof.

                (B) All notices or other communications required or permitted to
be given to Tenant or to Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given only if mailed by United States
registered mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by nationally recognized overnight
delivery service (such as Federal Express or United States Postal Service
Express Mail), addressed as follows: to Tenant, at the address first set forth
above, Attention: __________; to Lender, at the address first set forth above,

party may hereafter designate by notice delivered in accordance herewith. All
such notices shall be deemed given three (3) business days after delivery to the
United States Post office registry clerk if given by registered mail, or on the
next business day after delivery to an overnight delivery courier.

            14. This Agreement may be modified only by an agreement in writing
signed by the parties hereto, or their respective successors-in-interest. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto,
and their respective successors and assigns. The term "Lender" shall mean the
then holder of the Security Instrument. The term "Landlord" shall mean the then
holder of the landlord's interest in the Lease. The term "person" shall mean

                                      K-6
<PAGE>

an individual, joint venture, corporation, partnership, trust, limited liability
company, unincorporated association or other entity. All references herein to
the Lease shall mean the Lease as modified by this Agreement and to any
amendments or modifications to the Lease which are consented to in writing by
Lender. Any inconsistency between the Lease and the provisions of this Agreement
shall be resolved, to the extent of such inconsistency, in favor of this
Agreement.

            15. Tenant hereby represents to Lender as follows:

            (a) The Lease is in full force and effect and has not been further
amended.

            (b) There has been no assignment of the Lease or subletting of any
portion of the premises demised under the Lease.

            (c) There are no oral or written agreements or understandings
between Landlord and Tenant relating to the premises demised under the Lease or
the Lease transaction except as set forth in the Lease.

            (d) The execution of the Lease was duly authorized and the Lease is
in full force and effect and to the best of Tenant's knowledge there exists no
default (beyond any applicable grace period) on the part of either Tenant or
Landlord under the Lease.

            (e) There has not been filed by or against nor to the best of the
knowledge and belief of Tenant is there threatened against Tenant, any petition
under the bankruptcy laws of the United States.

            (f) To the best of Tenant's knowledge, there is no present
assignment, hypothecation or pledge of the Lease or rents accruing under the
Lease by Landlord, other than pursuant to the Security Instrument.

            16. Whenever, from time to time, reasonably requested by Lender (but
not more than three (3) times during any calendar year), Tenant shall execute
and deliver to or at the direction of Lender, and without charge to Lender, one
or more written certifications, in a form acceptable to Tenant, of all of the
matters set forth in Paragraph 15 above, and any other information the Lender
may reasonably require to confirm the current status of the Lease.

            17. BOTH TENANT AND LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

            18. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State in which the Property is located.

                           ARTICLE 8 "OPT IN" LANGUAGE

      Section _________. Shares and Share Certificates

(a)   Shares. A [Member's limited liability company interest in the Company]
      [Partner's limited partnership interest in the Partnership] shall be
      represented by the Shares issued to such [Member by the Company][Partner
      of the Partnership] . All of a [Member's][Partner's] Shares, in the
      aggregate, represent such [Member's][Partner's] entire [Partner by the
      Partnership] [limited liability company interest in the Company [limited
      partnership interest in the Partnership]. The [Member][Partner] hereby
      agrees that its interest in the [Company][Partnership] and in its Shares
      shall for all purposes be personal property. A [Member] [Partner] has no
      interest in specific [Company][Partnership] property. "Share" means a
      [limited liability company interest][limited partnership interest] in the
      [Company][Partnership] held by a [Member][Partner].

(b)   Share Certificates.

            i.    Upon the issuance of Shares to any [Member][Partner] in
                  accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
                  [Company][Partnership] shall issue one or more Share
                  Certificates in the name of such [Member][Partner]. Each such
                  Share Certificate shall be denominated in terms of the number
                  of Shares evidenced by such Share Certificate and shall be
                  signed by the [Member][Partner] on behalf of the
                  [Company][Partnership]. "Share Certificate" means a
                  non-negotiable certificate issued by the
                  [Company][Partnership] substantially in the form of Schedule
                  hereto, which evidences the ownership of one or more Shares.
                  Each Share Certificate shall bear the following legend: "This
                  certificate evidences an interest in
                  ________________________and shall be a security interest for
                  purposes of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the
                  State of Delaware and the Uniform Commercial Code of any other
                  Jurisdiction." This provision shall not be amended, and no
                  such purported amendment to this provision shall be effective
                  until all outstanding certificates have been surrendered for
                  cancellation.

            ii.   The [Company][Partnership] shall issue a new Share Certificate
                  in place of any Share Certificate previously issued if the
                  holder of the Shares represented by such Share Certificate, as
                  reflected on the books and records of the
                  [Company][Partnership].

                        (1)   makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance
                              satisfactory to the [Company][Partnership], that

                                      N-1
<PAGE>

                              such previously issued Share Certificate has been
                              lost, stolen or destroyed.

                        (2)   requests the issuance of a new Share Certificate
                              before the [Company][Partnership] has notice that
                              such previously issued Share Certificate has been
                              acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith
                              and without notice of an adverse claim;

                        (3)   if requested by the [Company][Partnership],
                              delivers to the [Company][Partnership] a bond, in
                              form and substance satisfactory to the
                              [Company][Partnership], with such surety or
                              sureties as the [Company][Partnership] may direct,
                              to indemnify the [Company][Partnership] against
                              any claim that may be made on account of the
                              alleged loss, destruction or theft of the
                              previously issued Share Certificate; and

                        (4)   satisfies any other reasonable requirements
                              imposed by the [Company][Partnership].

            iii.  Subject to the restrictions set forth in [describe Loan
                  Agreement/Mezzanine Loan Agreement restrictions] upon a
                  [Member's][Partner's]'s Transfer in accordance with the
                  provisions of this Agreement of any or all Shares represented
                  by a Share Certificate, the Transferee of such Shares shall
                  deliver such Share Certificate to the [Company][Partnership]
                  for cancellation, and the [Company][Partnership] shall
                  thereupon issue a new Share Certificate to such Transferee for
                  the number of Shares being Transferred and, if applicable,
                  cause to be issued to such [Member][Partner] a new Share
                  Certificate for that number of Shares that were represented by
                  the canceled Share Certificate and that are not being
                  Transferred. "Transfer" means, with respect to any Shares, and
                  when used as a verb, to sell or assign such Shares, and, when
                  used as a noun, shall have a meaning that correlates to the
                  foregoing. "Transferee" means an assignee or transferee.
                  "Transferor" means the Person making a Transfer.

      (c) Free Transferability.

New York, New York 10005 (together with its successors and assigns in such
capacity, "Lender").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                               - - - - - - - - - -

           WHEREAS, [          ], a Delaware limited partnership ("Borrower"),
together with certain borrower parties named therein, executed and delivered to
Lender on January 9, 2006, a Promissory Note (as the same may be amended,
supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Note")
evidencing a principal indebtedness of $1,000,000,000.00 (the "Loan") pursuant
to the Loan and Security Agreement among Borrower, certain other borrower
parties and Lender (as the same may be amended, supplemented, restated or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") and secured by a
Multi-State Amended, Restated and Consolidated Fee and Leasehold Mortgage, Deed
of Trust, Security Agreement, Financing Statement, Fixture Filing, and
Assignment of Leases, Rents, Hotel Revenue and Security Deposits (as the same
may be amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time,
the "Mortgage");

            WHEREAS, as a condition to approving the commencement of the
Existing Project, described as the [ ] Redevelopment Project in Schedule XVI of
the Loan Agreement (the "Project") at the property commonly known as [ ] (the
"Property") the Lender has required Guarantor to deliver this Guaranty for the
benefit of Lender; and

            WHEREAS, the forgoing recitals are intended to form an integral part
of this Agreement.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, Ten
Dollars ($10.00) paid in hand, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Guarantor agrees as
follows:

      1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have
the meaning provided in the Loan Agreement.

      2. Guaranty of Final Completion.

            (a) Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally
      guarantees the Final Completion of the Project in accordance with and
      subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, the other Loan
      Documents and this Guaranty (the "Guaranteed Obligations").

<PAGE>

            (b) If any of the obligations of Borrower under Section 10.2 (i) of
      the Loan Agreement are not complied with, in any respect whatsoever, and
      without the necessity of any notice from Lender to Guarantor, Guarantor
      agrees to (i) provide adequate capital, as a capital contribution to
      Borrower, to fund the Final Completion of the Project, (ii) assume all
      responsibility for the Final Completion of the Project and, at Guarantor's
      own cost and expense, to cause Final Completion of the Project to be fully
      completed in substantial accordance with the Loan Agreement; (iii) pay all
      bills in connection with the Final Completion of the Project; and (iv)
      indemnify and hold Lender harmless from any and all loss, cost, liability
      or expense Lender may suffer by reason thereof. Lender shall accept
      performance by Guarantor of Borrower's obligations under the Loan
      Documents with respect to Final Completion of the Project.

            (c) If an Event of Default has occurred and Borrower is not
      complying with its obligations under Section 10.2 (i) of the Loan
      Agreement or Guarantor is not complying with its obligations under Section
      2 (a) and (b) above, Lender may, at its option, cause Final Completion of
      the Project either before or after exercise of commencement of foreclosure
      proceedings or before or after any other remedy of Lender against Borrower
      or Guarantor, with such changes or modifications in the Project which
      Lender reasonably deems necessary and expend such sums as Lender, in its
      sole discretion, deems necessary and proper in order so to cause Final
      Completion of the Project and Guarantor hereby waives any rights to
      contest any such necessary expenditures. The amount of any and all
      expenditures made by Lender for the forgoing purposes shall be due and
      payable to Lender upon demand and shall accrue interest as provided in the
      Loan Documents.

            (d) Lender does not have and shall never have any obligation to
      assume responsibility for the Final Completion of the Project as set forth
      in Section 2 (c) above.

      3. Primary Liability of Guarantor. Subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations of this Guaranty, this Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional guaranty of completion. Guarantor shall, on demand and without
presentment, protest, notice of protest, further notice of dishonor or of
default or nonperformance, or further notice of acceleration or of intent to
accelerate, or any other notice whatsoever, without any notice having been given
to Guarantor previous to such demand of the acceptance by Lender of this
Guaranty, and without any notice having been given to Guarantor previous to such
demand of the creating or incurring of such obligation to perform or observe the
agreement, covenant, term or condition, as the case may be, cause the full and
complete satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to Section 2 hereof
and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Agreement, and it
shall not be necessary for Lender, in order to enforce such performance by
Guarantor, first to institute suit or exhaust their remedies against Borrower or
others liable for such performance, to enforce its rights against any security
which shall ever have been given to secure such performance, to join Borrower or
any others liable on the Guaranteed Obligation in any action to enforce this
Guaranty, to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right, including any
and all rights available to them at law or in equity or to resort to any other
means of obtaining performance of the Guaranteed Obligation. Suit may be brought
or demand may be made against all parties who have signed this Guaranty, or
against any one or more of them, separately or together, without impairing the
rights of Lender against any other party hereto. At any time

<PAGE>

Lender is entitled to exercise its remedies hereunder, Lender may in its
discretion elect to demand performance.

      4. Certain Agreements and Waivers by Guarantor. Guarantor hereby agrees
that neither Lender's rights and remedies nor Guarantor's obligations under the
terms of this Guaranty shall be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or
affected by any one or more of the following:

      Document;

      purported, believed or expected to exist in connection with any or all of
      the Guaranteed Obligation;

            (d) any partial release of the liability of Guarantor hereunder, or

      partial release of any one or more of them hereunder;

            (e) the death, insolvency, bankruptcy, disability, dissolution,
      liquidation, termination, receivership, reorganization, change of form
      and/or name, structure or ownership, sale of all assets, or lack of
      corporate, partnership or other power of Borrower, any of the undersigned,
      or any party at any time liable for the performance of any or all of the
      Guaranteed Obligation, whether now existing or hereafter occurring,
      including, without limitation, the occurrence of any event which would
      cause Guarantor and/or an Affiliate of Guarantor to no longer be the owner
      of the Property, the Existing Projects or the Borrower under the Loan
      Documents;

            (f) any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that may

      take or prosecute any action for the collection or enforcement of any of
      the Guaranteed Obligation or to foreclose or take or prosecute any action
      to foreclose upon any security therefor or to take or prosecute any action
      in connection with any Loan Document;

            (h) any failure of Lender to notify Guarantor of any assignment of
      the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or of any Loan Document,
      or of any release of or change in any security or of any other action
      taken or refrained from being taken by Lender against Borrower or any
      security or other recourse or of any new agreement between Lender and
      Borrower, it being understood that Lender shall not be required to give
      Guarantor any notice of any kind under any circumstances with respect to
      or in connection with the Guaranteed Obligation; provided, however,
      nothing contained in this Guaranty shall relieve the Lender of its
      obligation to provide notices to the Borrower under Section 19.6 of the
      Loan Agreement;
<PAGE>

            (i) the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed
      Obligation against Borrower or Guarantor, whether because the Guaranteed
      Obligation exceeds the amount permitted by law or violates any usury law,
      the act of creating the Guaranteed Obligation, or any part thereof, is
      ultra vires, the officers or persons creating same acted in excess of
      their authority, Borrower or Guarantor has any valid defense, claim or
      offset with respect thereto, or otherwise, it being agreed that Guarantor
      shall remain liable hereon regardless of whether any other person be found
      not liable on the Guaranteed Obligation, or any part thereof, for any
      reason; or

            (j) any payment by Borrower to Lender is held to constitute a
      preference under the bankruptcy laws or if for any other reason Lender is
      required to refund such payment or pay the amount thereof to someone else.

            It is the intent of Guarantor and Lender that, subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations of this Guaranty, the obligations and liabilities of
Guarantor hereunder are absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and that until the Guaranteed Obligation by Guarantor under this
Guaranty are fully and finally performed, such obligations and liabilities shall
not be discharged or released, in whole or in part, by any act or occurrence
which might, but for the provisions of this Guaranty, be deemed a legal or
equitable discharge or release of a guarantor, other than a payment in full of
the Loan.

      5. Obligations Deferred. Any indebtedness of Borrower to Guarantor now or
hereafter existing, including, without limitation, any rights to subrogation
which Guarantor may have as a result of any payment by Guarantor under this
Agreement, together with any interest thereon, shall be, and such indebtedness
is, hereby deferred, postponed and subordinated to the prior payment in full of
the Guaranteed Obligations. Until payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations,
including interest accruing on the Note after the commencement of a proceeding
by or against Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code which interest the parties
agree shall remain a claim that is prior and superior to any claim of Guarantor
notwithstanding any contrary practice, custom or ruling in cases under the
Bankruptcy Code generally, Guarantor agrees not to accept any payment or
satisfaction of any kind of indebtedness of Borrower to Guarantor and hereby
assigns such indebtedness to Lender, including the right to file proof of claim
and to vote thereon in connection with any such proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code, including the right to vote on any plan of reorganization.

      6. Other Liability of Guarantor or Borrower. If Guarantor becomes liable
for any indebtedness owing by Borrower to the Lender, by endorsement or
otherwise, other than under this Guaranty, such liability shall not be in any
manner impaired or affected hereby, and the rights of Lender hereunder shall be
cumulative of any and all other rights that Lender may ever have against
Guarantor.

      7. Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty is for the benefit of Lender and
its respective successors and assigns, and in the event of an assignment of the
Indebtedness, or any part thereof, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Loan Agreement, the rights and benefits hereunder may be transferred with the
Loan. After notice to Guarantor afforded to the Borrower to the extent such
notice is required under the Loan Agreement, which may be given simultaneously
with the giving of such notice to Borrower, Guarantor waives further notice of

<PAGE>

any transfer or assignment of the Loan, or any part thereof, and agrees that
failure to give notice will not affect the liabilities of Guarantor hereunder.

      8. Binding Effect. This Guaranty is binding not only on Guarantor, but on
Guarantor's respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.

      9. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. GUARANTOR AGREES THAT ANY SUIT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT
OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY
FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AND CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
SUCH COURT AND THE SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH SUIT BEING MADE UPON GUARANTOR
IN THE MANNER AND AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED FOR NOTICES IN THIS AGREEMENT.
GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT OR ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH SUIT IS BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT COURT.

      10. Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Guaranty or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for any reason and to
any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, neither the remainder of this Guaranty
nor the application of such provision to any other person or circumstance shall
be affected thereby, but rather the same shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by law.

      11. Attorneys Fees and Costs of Collection. Guarantor shall pay on demand
the reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses which may be
incurred by Lender in the enforcement of or preservation of Lender's rights
under this Guaranty, which covenant shall survive any payment or discharge in
full of the Loan and all amounts due under the Loan Agreement.

      12. Payments. All sums payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in lawful
money of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal
tender for the payment of public and -------- private debts.

      13. Intentionally Deleted.

      14. Notices. Subject to the last sentence of this Section, all notices,
requests, consents, demands and other communications required or which any party
desires to give hereunder (each, a "Notice") shall be in writing and shall be
deemed sufficiently given or furnished if delivered in accordance with Section
19.6 of the Loan Agreement. This Section shall not be construed in any way to
affect or impair any waiver of notice or demand provided in this Guaranty or in
any other Loan Document or to require giving of notice or demand to or upon any
person in any situation or for any reason. The addresses for Notices hereunder
shall be, in the case of Lender, its address set forth in the Building Loan
Agreement and in case of Guarantor, its address set forth opposite its signature
hereto.

<PAGE>

      15. No Election of Remedies. Unless waived in writing by Lender, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a default by Guarantor of the
provisions of this Guaranty, all or any one or more of the rights, powers,
privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Guarantor under this
Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or
applicable to, Guarantor or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at
any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Indebtedness
shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents. Any such actions taken by
Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently,
singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of
Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Guarantor agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) to the extent
permitted by law, Lender shall not be subject to any one action or election of
remedies law or rule and (ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or privileges
provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has
exhausted all of its remedies under the Loan Documents or the Indebtedness has
been paid in full. The granting of any consent, approval or waiver by Lender
shall be limited to the specific instance and purpose and shall not constitute
consent or approval in any other instance or for any other purpose. No notice to
nor demand on Guarantor in any case shall of itself entitle Guarantor to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, unless
otherwise required by this Guaranty or one of the other Loan Documents. No
provision of this Guaranty nor any right, remedy or recourse of Lender with
respect hereto, nor any default or breach, can be waived, nor can this Guaranty
or Guarantor be released or discharged in any way or to any extent, except in
accordance with the provisions of this Guaranty or specifically by a writing
intended for that purpose (referring specifically to this Guaranty) executed by
Lender.

      16. Term of Guaranty. This Guaranty shall continue in full force and
effect until Guarantor has fully and finally performed the Guaranteed
Obligations or the Full Completion of the Project. If pursuant to any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other debtor relief law or any order or decision
thereunder Lender must rescind or restore any payment or part thereof received
by Lender in satisfaction of any amounts due under the Loan Agreement or any
part thereof, including such payment to the extent rescinded or restored, and,
to the extent of the payment rescinded or restored, any prior release or
discharge by Lender of this Guaranty or of Guarantor shall be without effect and
this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such release
or discharge.

      17. Intentionally Deleted.

      18. Gender; Titles; Construction. Within this Guaranty, words of any
gender shall be held and construed to include any other gender, and words in the
singular number shall be held and construed to include the plural, unless the
context otherwise requires. Titles appearing at the beginning of any
subdivisions hereof are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such
subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the language contained in
such subdivisions. The use of the words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and
other similar compounds of the word "here" shall refer to this entire Guaranty
and not to any particular section, paragraph or provision.

<PAGE>

      19. Guarantor's Financial Condition. As of the date hereof, and after
giving effect to this Guaranty and the contingent obligation evidenced hereby,
Guarantor is and will be solvent and has and will have assets which, fairly
valued, exceed its obligations, liabilities (including contingent liabilities)
and debts, fairly valued, and has and expects to have property and assets
sufficient to satisfy and repay its obligations and liabilities.

      20. Guarantor's Minimum Net Worth. Guarantor has, as of the date hereof,
and shall maintain for so long as the Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding:
a net worth, as reasonably determined by Lender, of no less than the Minimum Net
Worth. Guarantor agrees to promptly give Lender written notice if at any time,
from time to time, while this Guaranty is in effect, Guarantor's net worth
decreases below the Minimum Net Worth.

      21. Intentionally Omitted.

      22. Execution. This Guaranty may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which, for all purposes, shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement; and if the term
"Guarantor" includes more than one person, the failure of any one or more such
persons to execute a counterpart thereof shall not impair or affect the
enforceability of this Guaranty against any person who does sign this Guaranty.

      23. Entire Agreement. This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement between
Lender and Guarantor with respect to the guaranty by Guarantor of the Guaranteed
Obligation and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, if any, with
respect to the guaranty by Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligation. The loan
documents constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the parties
thereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof. There are no unwritten
agreements between the parties to the loan documents regarding the transactions
which are the subject of the loan documents or related matters.

      24. JURY TRIAL WAIVER. GUARANTOR AND ALL PERSONS CLAIMING BY, THROUGH OR
UNDER IT, HEREBY EXPRESSLY, KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I)
ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY PRESENT OR
FUTURE MODIFICATION THEREOF OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF GUARANTOR OR LENDER WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT
(AS NOW OR HEREAFTER MODIFIED) OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT
EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO
OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION
IS NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT
OR OTHERWISE; AND GUARANTOR HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION MAY BE FILED WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS CONSULTED WITH LEGAL COUNSEL REGARDING THE
MEANING OF THIS WAIVER AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL
INDUCEMENT FOR

<PAGE>

THE MAKING OF THE LOAN. THIS WAIVER SHALL SURVIVE THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN.
