                                  -----------

     SECTION 2.1. Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
                  -----------
herein, each relevant Lender agrees (a) to make a Tranche C-1 Incremental Term
Loan in dollars to the Parent Borrower on the Amendment/Restatement Effective
Date in a principal amount not exceeding its Tranche C-1 Incremental Commitment,
(b) to make a Tranche C-2 Incremental Term Loan in dollars to the Parent
Borrower in a single drawing during the Tranche C-2 Commitment Period in a
principal amount not exceeding its Tranche C-2 Incremental Commitment, (c) to
make Domestic Revolving Loans in dollars to the Parent Borrower from time to
time during the Domestic Revolving Availability Period in an aggregate principal
amount that will not result in such Lender's Domestic Revolving Exposure
exceeding such Lender's Domestic Revolving Commitment and (d) to make Global
Revolving Loans in dollars or one or more Qualified Global Currencies (as
specified in the Borrowing Requests with respect thereto) to any Borrower from
time to time during the Global Revolving Availability Period in an aggregate
principal amount that will not result in (i) such Lender's Global Revolving
Exposure exceeding such Lender's Global Revolving Commitment or (ii) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Canadian Dollar Loans at
such time exceeding such Lender's Canadian Commitment. Within the foregoing
limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Parent
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Domestic Revolving Loans and any
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Global Revolving Loans. Amounts repaid
in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed. All Tranche A Term Loans,
Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans and Letters of Credit outstanding
under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date
shall remain outstanding to the Parent Borrower in dollars hereunder on the
terms set forth herein.

     SECTION 2.2.  Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan (other than a Swingline
                   --------------------
Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class
and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
Commitments of the applicable Class; provided that (i) each Global Revolving
                                     --------
Loan (other than Canadian Dollar Loans) shall be made by the Global Revolving
Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Available Global Revolving
Commitments and (ii) each Canadian Dollar Loan shall be made by the Canadian
Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Canadian Commitments. The
failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder.

          (b)  Subject to Section 2.15, (i) each Revolving Borrowing denominated
in dollars and each Term Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or
Eurocurrency Loans as the relevant Borrower may request in accordance herewith
and (ii) each Qualified Global Currency Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of
Eurocurrency Loans. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its
option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch
or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of
                                               --------
such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay
such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (c)  At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR
Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that
is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000; provided
                                                                    --------
that (i) an ABR Domestic Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that
is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Domestic Revolving
Commitments or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.5(e) and (ii) an ABR Global Revolving
Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused
balance of the

                                       31
<PAGE>

total Global Revolving Commitments. Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount
that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000. No more
than 20 Eurocurrency Borrowings may be outstanding at any one time under the
Facilities other than the Global Revolving Facility. Unless otherwise agreed by
the Administrative Agent, no more than 10 Eurocurrency Borrowings may be
outstanding at any one time under the Global Revolving Facility.

          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a Borrower
shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Domestic Revolving Maturity Date, Global Revolving Maturity Date, Tranche A
Maturity Date, Tranche B Maturity Date or Tranche C Maturity Date, as
applicable.

     SECTION 2.3.  Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving Borrowing or
                   -----------------------
Tranche C Incremental Term Borrowing, the relevant Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a
Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time (or if the
request is delivered in London, 11:00 a.m., London time), three Business Days
before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day
before the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of an
                                           --------
ABR Domestic Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.5(e) may be given not later than 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such
telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed
promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and (x) signed by the Parent
Borrower and, in the case of Borrowings by a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, such
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or (y) in the case of Borrowings by a Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower, signed by the Parent Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower, as specified by the Parent Borrower by prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.2: (i) the
Borrower requesting such Borrowing (and be signed on behalf of such Borrower);
(ii) the Class and Type of the requested Borrowing; (iii) the aggregate amount

shall be in dollars in the case of Term Loans, Domestic Revolving Loans and
Swingline Loans, and otherwise shall be in dollars or a Qualified Global
Currency). If no election as to the currency of a Global Revolving Borrowing is
specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be denominated
in dollars. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing if denominated in dollars or a
Eurocurrency Borrowing if denominated in a Qualified Global Currency. If no
Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency
Borrowing, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a
Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent
shall advise each relevant Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of
such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.4.  Swingline Loans (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set
                   ---------------
forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Parent
Borrower from time to time during the Domestic Revolving Availability Period, in
an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in
(i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding
$30,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the total Domestic Revolving Exposures exceeding
the total Domestic Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender
                                          --------
shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding
Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Parent Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow
Swingline Loans.

                                       32
<PAGE>

          (b)  To request a Swingline Loan, the Parent Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy
promptly thereafter), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day
of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the
requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the
Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Parent Borrower. The
Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Parent Borrower
by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Parent Borrower with
the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.5(e), by remittance
to the applicable Issuing Lender) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
requested date of such Swingline Loan.

          (c)  The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any
Business Day require the Domestic Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on
such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such
notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Domestic
Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the
Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Domestic Revolving Lender,
specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline
Loans. Each Domestic Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally
agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of such Swingline Loans. Each Domestic Revolving Lender acknowledges
and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans
pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Domestic Revolving Lender
shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.6 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.6 shall apply, mutatis
                                                                   -------
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Domestic Revolving Lenders), and the
--------
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so
received by it from the Domestic Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Parent Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan
acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such
Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the
Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Parent
Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Parent Borrower) in respect of a
Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale
of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative
Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly
remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Domestic Revolving Lenders that
shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline
Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a
Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Parent Borrower
of any default in the payment thereof.

     SECTION 2.5. Letters of Credit (a) General. Subject to the terms and
                  -----------------     -------
conditions set forth herein, any Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of
Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Lender, at any time and from
time to time during the Domestic Revolving Availability Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the account party for each Letter of Credit shall be the Parent
Borrower or the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, as specified by the
Administrative and the applicable Issuing Lender in consultation with the Parent
Borrower. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit
application or other agreement submitted by a Borrower to, or entered into by a
Borrower with, the applicable Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of Credit,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. The letters of credit
identified on

                                       33
<PAGE>

Schedule 2.5 (the "Existing Letters of Credit") shall be deemed to be "Letters
                   --------------------------
of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

          (b)  Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
               ----------------------------------------------------------
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
----------
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the relevant Borrower
shall deliver to the applicable Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent
(reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension) a notice specifying the name of the relevant Borrower and requesting
the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be
amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such
Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this
Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the currency in which such Letter
of Credit is to be denominated (which shall be dollars or, subject to Section
2.21, an Alternative Currency), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or
extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Lender, the
relevant Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such
Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of
Credit. Following receipt of such notice and prior to the issuance of the
requested Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall calculate the Dollar
Equivalent of such Letter of Credit and shall notify the Parent Borrower, the
relevant Borrower and the applicable Issuing Lender of the amount of the Total
Domestic Exposure after giving effect to (i) the issuance of such Letter of
Credit, (ii) the issuance or expiration of any other Letter of Credit that is to
be issued or will expire prior to the requested date of issuance of such Letter
of Credit and (iii) the borrowing or repayment of any Domestic Revolving Loans
or Swingline Loans that (based upon notices delivered to the Administrative
Agent by the Parent Borrower) are to be borrowed or repaid prior to the
requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be
issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Parent Borrower and the
relevant Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure
shall not exceed $250,000,000, (ii) the Alternative Currency LC Exposure shall
not exceed $30,000,000 and (iii) the Total Domestic Exposure shall not exceed
the total Domestic Revolving Commitments.

          (c)  Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
               ---------------
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Domestic Revolving Maturity Date,
provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, Letters of Credit having an
--------
aggregate face amount not in excess of $25,000,000 may provide for an expiration
date that is more than one year after the date of issuance, so long as such
expiration date does not extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii)
above.

          (d)  Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
               --------------
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Lender or the Lenders, the
applicable Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Domestic Revolving Lender, and
each Domestic Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a
participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Domestic
Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent in dollars, for the account of such Issuing Lender, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of (i) each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing
Lender in dollars and (ii) the Dollar Equivalent, using the Exchange Rates on
the date such payment is required, of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing
Lender in an Alternative Currency and, in each case, not reimbursed by the
relevant Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section,
or of any reimbursement payment required to be

                                       34
<PAGE>

refunded to such Borrower for any reason (or, if such reimbursement payment was
refunded in an Alternative Currency, the Dollar Equivalent thereof using the
Exchange Rates on the date of such refund). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in
respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that
each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
reduction whatsoever.

          (e)  Reimbursement. If the applicable Issuing Lender shall make any LC
               -------------
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the relevant Borrower shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such LC Disbursement in dollars, or (subject to the two immediately
succeeding sentences) the applicable Alternative Currency, not later than 12:00
noon, New York City time or the relevant local time, as applicable, on the date
that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice
of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time or the relevant
local time, as applicable, on such date, or, if such notice has not been
received by such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time or the relevant local time, as applicable, on the
Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such
notice; provided that, in the case of any LC Disbursement made in dollars, the
        --------
relevant Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.3 or 2.4 that such payment be financed in
dollars with an ABR Domestic Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower's obligation to
make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Domestic
Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the relevant Borrower's reimbursement
of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Alternative Currency would
subject the Administrative Agent, the applicable Issuing Lender or any Lender to
any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if
such reimbursement were made or required to be made in dollars, such Borrower
shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the
Administrative Agent, the relevant Issuing Lender or Lender or (y) reimburse
each LC Disbursement made in such Alternative Currency in dollars, in an amount
equal to the Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rate on
the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement. If the relevant
Borrower fails to make such payment when due, then (i) if such payment relates
to an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, automatically and with no further
action required, such Borrower's obligation to reimburse the applicable LC
Disbursement shall be permanently converted into an obligation to reimburse the
Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange Rates on the date when such
payment was due, of such LC Disbursement and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the applicable Issuing Lender and each other Domestic Revolving
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the Dollar Equivalent thereof (if such
LC Disbursement relates to an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit), the
payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Domestic Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent in dollars its
Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the relevant Borrower
(determined as provided in clause (i) above, if such payment relates to an
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit), in the same manner as provided in
Section 2.6 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.6 shall
apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Domestic Revolving
       ------- --------
Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable
Issuing Lender in dollars the amounts so received by it from the Domestic
Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment from any Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Lender or, to the extent
that Domestic Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as
their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Domestic Revolving Lender
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse any Issuing Lender for any LC

                                       35
<PAGE>

Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Domestic Revolving Loans or a
Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
relieve any Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

          (f)  Obligations Absolute.  A Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
               --------------------
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit, any application for the issuance of a Letter of Credit or this
Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the
terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower's obligations hereunder.
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Lender, nor any of
their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of
or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any
payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
applicable Issuing Lender; provided that neither of the foregoing sentences
                           --------
shall be construed to excuse such Issuing Lender from liability to a Borrower to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing
Lender's gross negligence, willful misconduct or failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an
Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction),
such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the
generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
Letter of Credit, an Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept
and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or
refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not
in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g)  Disbursement Procedures.  The applicable Issuing Lender shall,
               -----------------------
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the relevant Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy promptly thereafter) of such demand for payment
and whether such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement
thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice
            --------
shall not relieve the relevant Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such
Issuing Lender and the Domestic Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

          (h)  Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC
               ----------------
Disbursement, then, unless the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount
thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses
such LC

                                       36
<PAGE>

Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Domestic Revolving
Loans; provided that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement
       --------
when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.14(c) shall
apply; provided further that, in the case of an LC Disbursement made under an
       -------- -------
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, the amount of interest due with respect
thereto shall (i) in the case of any LC Disbursement that is reimbursed on or
before the Business Day immediately succeeding such LC Disbursement, (A) be
payable in the applicable Alternative Currency and (B) if not reimbursed on the
date of such LC Disbursement, bear interest at a rate equal to the rate
reasonably determined by the applicable Issuing Lender to be the cost to such
Issuing Lender of funding such LC Disbursement plus the Applicable Margin
applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans at such time and (ii) in the case of
any LC Disbursement that is reimbursed after the Business Day immediately
succeeding such LC Disbursement (A) be payable in dollars, (B) accrue on the
Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange Rates on the date such LC
Disbursement was made, of such LC Disbursement and (C) bear interest at the rate
per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans, subject to Section 2.14(c).
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
applicable Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of
payment by any Domestic Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender
to the extent of such payment.

          (i)  Replacement of any Issuing Lender.  Any Issuing Lender may be
               ---------------------------------
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Parent Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
replacement of such Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall
become effective, the Parent Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the
account of the replaced Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.13(b). From and
after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing
Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Lender under
this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and
(ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to refer to
such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all
previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of
an Issuing Lender hereunder, the replaced Issuing Lender shall remain a party
hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior
to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of
Credit.

          (j)  Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and
               ----------------------
be continuing, on the Business Day that a Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Domestic Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
at least 51% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, such Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Domestic Revolving Lenders, an amount in dollars and in cash
equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon; provided that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn
         --------
Alternative Currency Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements in an Alternative
Currency that the Borrowers are not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in
the applicable Alternative Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn
Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such
cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall
become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind,
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower
described in paragraph (h) or (i) of Article VII. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the Alternative Currency LC Exposure shall be calculated using the
Exchange Rates on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered
to a Borrower. Each Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(e). Each such deposit
pursuant to this paragraph or pursuant to Section 2.11(e) shall be held by the
Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative

                                       37
<PAGE>

Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right
of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the
investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and
sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the relevant Borrower's risk
and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any,
on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing
Lender for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the relevant Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
Domestic Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing at least 51% of the
total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of such Borrower
under this Agreement. If a Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such
amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such
Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
or waived. If a Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral
hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(e), such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower as and to the extent that, after
giving effect to such return, such Borrower would remain in compliance with
Section 2.11(e), and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

          (k)  Conversion.  In the event that the Loans become immediately due
               ----------
and payable on any date pursuant to Article VII, all amounts (i) that a Borrower
is at the time or thereafter becomes required to reimburse or otherwise pay to
the Administrative Agent in respect of LC Disbursements made under any
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (other than amounts in respect of which
such Borrower has deposited cash collateral pursuant to Section 2.5(j), if such
cash collateral was deposited in the applicable Alternative Currency to the
extent so deposited or applied), (ii) that the Domestic Revolving Lenders are at
the time or thereafter become required to pay to the Administrative Agent and
the Administrative Agent is at the time or thereafter becomes required to
distribute to the applicable Issuing Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section in respect of unreimbursed LC Disbursements made under any Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit and (iii) of each Domestic Revolving Lender's
participation in any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit under which an LC
Disbursement has been made shall, automatically and with no further action
required, be converted into the Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange
Rates on such date (or in the case of any LC Disbursement made after such date,
on the date such LC Disbursement is made), of such amounts. On and after such
conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to the Administrative Agent, the
applicable Issuing Lender or any Lender in respect of the Obligations described
in this paragraph shall accrue and be payable in dollars at the rates otherwise
applicable hereunder.

          (l)  Additional Issuing Lenders.  The Parent Borrower may, at any time
               --------------------------
and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Domestic Revolving Lender,
designate one or more additional Domestic Revolving Lenders to act as an issuing
lender under the terms of this Agreement, provided that the total number of
                                          --------
Domestic Revolving Lenders so designated at any time plus the total number of
Issuing Lenders pursuant to clause (c) of the definition of the term "Issuing
Lenders" at such time shall not exceed five. Any Domestic Revolving Lender
designated as Issuing Lender pursuant to this paragraph (1) shall be deemed to
be an "Issuing Lender" for the purposes of this Agreement (in addition to being
a Domestic Revolving Lender) with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such
Domestic Revolving Lender.

          (m)  Reporting.  Each Issuing Lender will report in writing to the
               ---------
Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each week, the aggregate
face amount of Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the last
Business Day of the preceding week, (ii) on or prior to each Business Day on
which such Issuing Lender expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of
Credit, the date of such issuance or amendment, and the aggregate face amount of
Letters of Credit to be issued, amended,

                                       38
<PAGE>

renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (and such Issuing Lender shall advise the
Administrative Agent on such Business Day whether such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension occurred and whether the amount thereof changed), (iii) on
each Business Day on which such Issuing Lender makes any LC Disbursement, the
date of such LC Disbursement and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on
any Business Day on which any Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement
required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Lender on such day, the date of such
failure, the relevant Borrower and amount of such LC Disbursement.

     SECTION 2.6.  Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan
                   ---------------------
to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer to the
account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders, in immediately available funds, not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, in the case of fundings to an account in New
York City, or 12:00 noon, local time, in the case of fundings to an account in
another jurisdiction; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in
                      --------
Section 2.4. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
relevant Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds,
to an account designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request,
which account must be in the name of such Borrower and, as applicable, in London
or in the financial center of the country of the currency of the Loan; provided
                                                                       --------
that ABR Domestic Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.5(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Lender. Unless otherwise agreed
by the Administrative Agent, the Tranche C Incremental Term Loans made on the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date shall initially be ABR Loans.

          (b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable
Borrower a corresponding amount in the required currency. In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount with interest thereon in such currency, for each day from and including
the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender,
the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in
the relevant currency (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such
Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then
such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.7.  Interest Elections.  (a)  Each Revolving Borrowing and Term
                   ------------------
Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial
Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, a Borrower
may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest
Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. A Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a Borrower may not (i) elect to convert the currency in which any Loans are
denominated, (ii) elect to convert Qualified Global Currency Loans from
Eurocurrency Loans to ABR Loans, (iii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency
Loans that does not comply with Section 2.2(d), (iv) elect to convert any ABR
Loans to Eurocurrency Loans that would result

                                       39
<PAGE>

in the number of Eurocurrency Borrowings exceeding the maximum number of
Eurocurrency Borrowings permitted under Section 2.2(c), (v) elect an Interest
Period for Eurocurrency Loans unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of Eurocurrency Loans (including any Eurocurrency Loans made to such Borrower in
the same currency on the date that such Interest Period is to begin) to which
such Interest Period will apply complies with the requirements as to minimum
principal amount set forth in Section 2.2(c) or (vi) elect to convert or
continue any Swingline Borrowings.

          (b)  To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.3 if such Borrower were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the relevant Borrower.

          (c)  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.2 and paragraph
(a) of this Section: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
applies; (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting
Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and (iv) if the
resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be
applicable thereto after giving effect to such election. If any such Interest
Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an
Interest Period, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d)  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each relevant Lender of the details thereof
and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e)  If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars
prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such
Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. If the relevant Borrower fails
to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency
Borrowing denominated in a Qualified Global Currency prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall
automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Loan having an Interest Period of one
month. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Parent Borrower, then, so long as an Event of
Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in dollars may be
converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in dollars shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) no
Borrowing denominated in a Qualified Global Currency having an Interest Period
in excess of one month may be made or continued.

     SECTION 2.8.  Termination and Reduction of Commitments.  (a) Unless
                   ----------------------------------------
previously terminated, (i) the Tranche C-1 Incremental Commitments shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Amendment/Restatement
Effective Date, (ii) the Tranche C-2 Incremental Commitment shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Tranche C-2 Commitment
Period (or such earlier date on which the Tranche C-2 Incremental Commitment
shall have been fully utilized), (iii) the Domestic Revolving Commitments shall
terminate on the Domestic Revolving Maturity Date and (iv) the Global Revolving
Commitments shall terminate on the Global Revolving Maturity Date.

                                       40
<PAGE>

          (b)  The Parent Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of
                                           --------
the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Parent Borrower shall
not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any
concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11,
(i) the Total Domestic Exposure would exceed the total Domestic Revolving
Commitments or (ii) the Total Global Exposure would exceed the total Global
Revolving Commitments.

          (c)  The Parent Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section, at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Parent Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a
                                                               --------
notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Parent
Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness or
closing of other credit facilities, debt financings or Dispositions, in which
case such notice may be revoked by the Parent Borrower (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments
shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of
such Class.

     SECTION 2.9.  Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in
                   ----------------
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by
such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to
such Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (b)  The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrowers, shall
maintain the Register pursuant to Section 9.4(c) and a subaccount for each
Lender in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder
(whether or not evidenced by a promissory note), the Class and Type thereof and
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (c)  The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(a) or (b) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
                                    ----- -----
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
                                             --------
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (d)  Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each applicable Borrower shall
prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the
order of such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note
and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to
Section 9.4) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable
to such payee and its registered assigns.

     SECTION 2.10. Repayment of Loans.  (a) The Parent Borrower shall repay
                   ------------------

The amounts set forth above shall be ratably reduced to the extent the Tranche
C-2 Incremental Commitments are not fully utilized on or prior to the last day
of the Tranche C-2 Commitment Period.  In the event that Tranche C-2 Incremental
Term Loans are borrowed after June 30, 2001, the amortization payment in respect
of Tranche C Term Loans due on June 30, 2001 shall be appropriately reduced and
the amount of Tranche C-2 Incremental Term Loans permitted to be borrowed shall
be reduced by the amount of such reduction.

          (d)  The Parent Borrower shall repay (i) the then unpaid principal
amount of the Domestic Revolving Loans on the Domestic Revolving Maturity Date
and (ii) the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier
of the Domestic Revolving Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline
Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least
two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date
                                                     --------
that a Domestic Revolving Borrowing is made, the Parent Borrower shall repay all
Swingline Loans then outstanding.

          (e)  Each Borrower shall repay the then unpaid principal amount of the
Global Revolving Loans on the Global Revolving Maturity Date.

     SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans.  (a) Each Borrower shall have the right
                   -------------------
at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part,
subject to the requirements of this Section, provided that Canadian B/As may not
                                             --------
be optionally prepaid.

          (b)  If on any date any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of
the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment Event, the
Parent Borrower shall, within ten

                                       43
<PAGE>

Business Days after such Net Proceeds are received, prepay Term Borrowings in an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of such Net Proceeds; provided that, in the
                                                           --------
case of any event described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition of the term
Prepayment Event, if the Parent Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that the Parent
Borrower and the Subsidiaries intend to apply the Net Proceeds from such event
("Reinvestment Net Proceeds"), within 360 days after receipt of such Net
  -------------------------
Proceeds, to make Permitted Acquisitions or Investments permitted by Section 6.5
or acquire real property, equipment or other assets to be used in the business
of the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and certifying that no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be
required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of such event except to the
extent of any Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of
such 360-day period, at which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount
equal to the Net Proceeds that have not been so applied. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from and after the date in any fiscal year of the Parent Borrower on
which the aggregate gross proceeds (inclusive of amounts of the type described
in the first parenthetical of Section 6.6(d)) from Dispositions pursuant to
Sections 6.6(d) and (j) received during such fiscal year exceed 10% of total
assets of the Parent Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries (determined in
accordance with GAAP) as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ended immediately
prior to the date of the relevant Disposition, the Net Proceeds from each
subsequent Prepayment Event occurring during such fiscal year resulting from
Dispositions pursuant to Sections 6.6(d) and (j) (and a ratable amount of Net
Proceeds from any Prepayment Event that first causes the aforementioned 10%
threshold to be exceeded, which ratable amount shall be determined by reference
to a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the portion of the gross proceeds
from such Prepayment Event representing the excess above such 10% threshold and
the denominator of which shall be the aggregate gross proceeds from such
Prepayment Event) may not be treated as Reinvestment Net Proceeds.

          (c)  The Parent Borrower shall prepay Term Borrowings in an aggregate
amount equal to the ECF Percentage of Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year,
commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. Each prepayment
pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the date on which
financial statements are delivered pursuant to Section 5.1 with respect to the
fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and in any event
within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

          (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with
respect to the amount of any mandatory prepayment described in Section 2.11 that
is allocated to Tranche B Borrowings or Tranche C Borrowings (such amounts, the
"Tranche B Prepayment Amount" and the "Tranche C Prepayment Amount",
 ---------------------------           ---------------------------
respectively), at any time when Tranche A Borrowings remain outstanding, the
Parent Borrower will, in lieu of applying such amount to the prepayment of
Tranche B Borrowings and Tranche C Borrowings, respectively:

               (i)  in the case of any mandatory prepayment described in Section
          2.11(b), on the date of the relevant Prepayment Event, give the
          Administrative Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing)
          requesting that the Administrative Agent prepare and provide to each
          Tranche B Lender and Tranche C Lender a notice (each, a "Prepayment
                                                                   ----------
          Option Notice") as described below. As promptly as practicable after
          -------------
          receiving such notice from the Parent Borrower, the Administrative
          Agent will send to each Tranche B Lender and Tranche C Lender a
          Prepayment Option Notice, which shall be in the form of Exhibit H, and
          shall include an offer by the Parent Borrower to prepay on the date
          that is ten Business Days after the date of the relevant Prepayment
          Event, the relevant Term Loans of such Lender by an amount equal to
          the portion of the Prepayment Amount indicated in such Lender's
          Prepayment Option Notice as being applicable to such Lender's Tranche
          B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans, as the case may be, and

                                       44
<PAGE>

               (ii) in the case of any mandatory prepayment described in Section
          2.11(c), on the date specified in this Section for prepayment, give
          the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in
          writing) requesting that the Administrative Agent prepare and provide
          to each Tranche B Lender and Tranche C Lender a Prepayment Option
          Notice as described below. As promptly as practicable after receiving
          such notice from the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent will
          send to each Tranche B Lender and Tranche C Lender a Prepayment Option
          Notice, which shall be in the form of Exhibit H, and shall include an
          offer by the Parent Borrower to prepay on the date that is five
          Business Days after the date of the Prepayment Option Notice, the
          relevant Term Loans of such Lender by an amount equal to the portion
          of the Prepayment Amount indicated in such Lender's Prepayment Option
          Notice as being applicable to such Lender's Tranche B Term Loans or
          Tranche C Term Loans, as the case may be.

Each Tranche B Lender and Tranche C Lender shall return a completed Prepayment
Option Notice to the Administrative Agent no later than three Business Days
prior to the mandatory prepayment date specified in the applicable Prepayment
Option Notice (each a "Mandatory Prepayment Date"), with the failure to so
                       -------------------------
return such notice being deemed to constitute an acceptance of the relevant
prepayment.  On the Mandatory Prepayment Date, (i) the Parent Borrower shall pay
to the relevant Tranche B Lenders and Tranche C Lenders the aggregate amount
necessary to prepay that portion of the outstanding relevant Term Loans in
respect of which such Lenders have accepted, or have been deemed to have
accepted, prepayment as described above, (ii) the Parent Borrower shall pay to
the Tranche A Lenders an amount equal to the portion of the Tranche B Prepayment
Amount and the Tranche C Prepayment Amount not accepted by the Tranche B Lenders
and the Tranche C Lenders, and such amount shall be applied to the prepayment of
the Tranche A Borrowings.

          (e)  If on any Determination Date relating to the Global Revolving
Facility, the Total Global Exposure exceeds 105% of the total Global Revolving
Commitments, the Parent Borrower shall, without notice or demand, within three
Business Days after such Determination Date, prepay (or cause the relevant
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to prepay) Revolving Borrowings in an aggregate
amount such that, after giving effect thereto, (i) the Total Global Exposure
does not exceed the total Global Revolving Commitments and (ii) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Canadian Dollar Loans does not exceed the
total Canadian Commitments. If on any Determination Date relating to the
Domestic Revolving Facility, the Total Domestic Exposure exceeds 105% of the
total Domestic Revolving Commitments, the Parent Borrower shall, without notice
or demand, within three Business Days after such Determination Date, prepay
Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are
outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 2.5(j)) in an aggregate amount such that, after giving
effect thereto, the Total Domestic Exposure does not exceed the total Domestic
Revolving Commitments.

          (f)  A Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy promptly thereafter) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in
the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time (or 11:00 a.m., London time, as applicable), three Business
Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day
before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline
Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment.
Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the
principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the
case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount
of such prepayment; provided that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given
                    --------
in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving
Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.8, then such notice of prepayment may
be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section
2.8.

                                       45
<PAGE>

Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating
solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the
same Type as provided in Section 2.2, except as necessary to apply fully the
required amount of a mandatory prepayment.

     SECTION 2.12. Certain Payment Application Matters. (a) Each repayment or
                   -----------------------------------
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
repaid Borrowing. It is understood that, in the case of Global Revolving Loans,
the relevant Borrower may select the particular currency of Loans to be prepaid,
and such prepayment shall then be applied ratably to such Loans. Repayments and
prepayments of Term Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the
amount repaid.

          (b)    Any mandatory prepayment of Term Borrowings shall, subject to
Section 2.11(d), be allocated pro rata among the Tranche A Term Borrowings,
                              --- ----
Tranche B Term Borrowings and Tranche C Term Borrowings based on the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Borrowings of each such Class.

          (c)    Each optional prepayment and each mandatory prepayment pursuant
to Section 2.11(c) allocated to the Tranche A Term Borrowings, the Tranche B
Term Borrowings or the Tranche C Term Borrowings shall, subject to Section
2.11(d), be applied to the installments thereof, first to any remaining
                                                 -----
scheduled installments due prior to the first anniversary of the date of such
prepayment (applied pro rata to such remaining installments) and, second, to the
                    --- ----                                      ------
remaining scheduled installments due on or after the first anniversary of the
date of such prepayment (applied pro rata to such remaining installments). Each
                                 --- ----
other mandatory prepayment allocated to the Tranche A Term Borrowings, the
Tranche B Term Borrowings or the Tranche C Term Borrowings shall, subject to
Section 2.11(d), be applied pro rata to the remaining installments thereof.
                            --- ----

     SECTION 2.13. Fees (a) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the
                   ----
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee,
which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of
each Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment
terminates. The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender with a Tranche C-2 Incremental Commitment a
commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the amount of the
Tranche C-2 Incremental Commitment of such Lender during the period from and
including the Amendment/Restatement Effective Date to but excluding the date on
which such Tranche C-2 Incremental Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment
fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year, on the date on which the Tranche C-2 Incremental
Commitment terminates (in the case of commitment fees in respect of such
Commitment) and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate,
commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. Commitment
fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing commitment fees
in respect of the Revolving Commitments, (i) the Domestic Revolving Commitment
of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Domestic
Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of
such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose) and (ii) the Global Revolving
Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the
outstanding Global Revolving Loans of such Lender.

          (b)    Each Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Domestic Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect
to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same
Applicable Rate as interest on Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the

                                       46
<PAGE>

average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which
such Lender's Domestic Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which
such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the applicable Issuing
Lender a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.20% per annum on the
average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Domestic Revolving Commitments and the date on which there
ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Lender's standard fees
with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting
fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Domestic
--------
Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on
which the Domestic Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.
Any other fees payable to the applicable Issuing Lender pursuant to this
paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees
and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day). For the purposes of calculating the average daily
amount of the LC Exposure for any period under this Section 2.13(b), the average
daily amount of the Alternative Currency LC Exposure for such period shall be
calculated by multiplying (x) the average daily balance of each Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit (expressed in the currency in which such Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit is denominated) by (y) the Exchange Rate for each such
Alternative Currency in effect on the last Business Day of such period or by
such other reasonable method that the Administrative Agent deems appropriate.

          (c)    Each Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed
upon between such Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

          (d)    All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable
Issuing Lender, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case
of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.14. Interest. (a) ABR Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate
                   --------
Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

          (b)    Eurocurrency Loans shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO
Rate for the applicable Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate.


          (c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section
(or, in the case of amounts denominated in a Qualified Foreign Global Currency
the rate that would apply to Loans in such currency pursuant to clause (i)
above), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date
of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before
judgment).

                                       47
<PAGE>

          (d)    Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest
                                               --------
accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Domestic Revolving
Availability Period or Global Revolving Availability Period, as applicable),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on
the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

          (e)    All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate, and
interest in respect of sterling-denominated Loans, shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO
Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     SECTION 2.15. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of
                   --------------------------
any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:

          (a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
     be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
     not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period;

          (b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Majority Facility
     Lenders under the relevant Facility that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such
     Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
     Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan)
     included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; or

          (c)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
     be conclusive absent manifest error) that deposits in the principal amounts
     of the Loans comprising such Borrowing and in the currency in which such
     Loans are to be denominated are not generally available in the relevant
     market;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Parent Borrower
and the relevant Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and
the relevant Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, then, in the case of the relevant Facility, any request by a Borrower for
a Eurocurrency Borrowing of the affected Type or in the affected currency, or a
conversion to or continuation of a Eurocurrency Borrowing of the affected Type
or in the affected currency, pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.7, shall be deemed
rescinded; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect
           --------
only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be
permitted.

     SECTION 2.16. Increased Costs.  (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
                   ---------------

                 (i)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
          deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
          the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
          reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

                                       48
<PAGE>

               (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Lender or the London (or
          other relevant) interbank market any other condition affecting this
          Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of
          Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the net cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or
Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then
each relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case
may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)  If any Lender or Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by,
such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level
below that which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lender's or Issuing
Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Lender's policies and the policies
of such Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time the relevant Borrower will pay to such Lender
or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lender's or Issuing Lender's
holding company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c)  A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Lender setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may
be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to
the relevant Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such
Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. All amounts payable by
any Borrower pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be deemed to
constitute interest expense in respect of the Loans.

          (d)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Lender to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided
                                                                     --------
that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Lender
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more
than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case
may be, notifies such Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Lender's intention
to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law
                                -------- -------
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-
day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

     SECTION 2.17.  Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of
                    ----------------------
any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period (or, in the case of Canadian B/As, the Canadian Contract Period)
applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any
Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any
Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period (or, in the
case of Canadian B/As, the Canadian Contract Period) applicable thereto as a
result of a request by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20, then,

                                       49
<PAGE>

in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency
Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an
amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to
such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period (or, in the case of Canadian B/As, the Canadian
Contract Period) therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period or Canadian
Contract Period, as applicable, for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest
which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate
which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period,
for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from
other banks in the relevant market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth
any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section shall be delivered to the relevant Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as
due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

     SECTION 2.18.  Taxes (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
                    -----
obligation of the Parent Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes;
provided that if a Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes
--------
from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or the
relevant Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b)  In addition, each Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and indemnify
the Lender from and against any Other Taxes and any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto.

          (c)  Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender on or with
respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of a Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes imposed
or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed
or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the
amount of such payment or liability delivered to a Borrower by a Lender, or by
the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and shall be so delivered as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, obtains actual knowledge of such amount.

          (d)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                                       50
<PAGE>

          (e)  Each Lender that is not a United States person within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver
                                               ---------------
to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or before the date on
which it becomes a party to this Agreement either:

               (A)  two duly completed and signed original copies of either
          Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form
          W-8ECI (relating to such Non-U.S. Lender and entitling it to a
          complete exemption from or reduction of withholding of United States
          federal income taxes on all amounts to be received by such Non-U.S.
          Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other credit documents), or
          successor and related applicable forms, as the case may be (including,
          where applicable with respect to both (x) and (y) any such forms
          required to be provided to certify to such exemption on behalf of such
          Non-U.S. Lender's beneficial owners).

               (B)  in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not a "Bank" within
          the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and that does not
          comply with the requirements of clause (A) hereof, (x) a statement in
          the form of Exhibit F (and any similar statements required to certify
          to the exemption of its beneficial owners) or such other form of
          statements as shall be reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower
          from time to time to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender (and, where
          applicable, its beneficial owners) is eligible for a complete
          exemption from withholding of United States federal income taxes under
          Code Section 871(h) or 881(c), and (y) two duly completed and signed
          original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or successor
          and related applicable forms (including, where applicable, copies of
          such forms with respect to such entity's beneficial owners).

               Further, each Non-U.S. Lender agrees (i) to deliver to the Parent
          Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the
          assigning Lender two further duly completed and signed original copies
          of such Forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as the case may be (and, where
          applicable, any such forms on behalf of its beneficial owners) or
          successor and related applicable forms, on or before the date that any
          such form expires or becomes obsolete and promptly after the
          occurrence of any event requiring a change from the most recent
          form(s) previously delivered by it to the Parent Borrower in
          accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, (ii) in the case
          of a Non-U.S. Lender that delivers a statement in the form of Exhibit
          F (or such other form of statement as shall have been requested by the
          Parent Borrower), to deliver to the Parent Borrower and the
          Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the assigning Lender, such
          statement (and where applicable, any such statements from its
          beneficial owners) on the two year anniversary of the date on which
          such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement and to deliver
          promptly to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such
          additional statements and forms as shall be reasonably requested by
          the Parent Borrower from time to time, and (iii) to notify promptly
          the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent if it (or, as
          applicable, its beneficial owners) is no longer able to deliver, or if
          it is required to withdraw or cancel, any form of statement previously
          delivered by it pursuant to this Section 2.18(e). Notwithstanding
          anything herein to the contrary, (x) no Non-U.S. Lender shall be
          required to provide any forms, certification or documentation which it
          is not legally entitled to deliver and (y) no Canadian Lender shall be
          required to provide any Internal Revenue Service forms pursuant to
          this Section 2.18(e).

          (f)  Each Lender which is not a Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to
Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and if applicable the assigning or
participating Lender) two copies of a

                                       51
<PAGE>

statement which shall contain the address of such Lender's office or place of
business in the United States, which shall be signed by an authorized officer of
such Lender, together with two duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) unless it establishes to the
satisfaction of the Parent Borrower that it is otherwise eligible for an
exemption from backup withholding tax or other applicable withholding tax. Each
such Lender shall deliver to the Parent Borrower and Administrative Agent two
further duly completed and signed forms and statements (or successor form) at or
before the time any such form or statement becomes obsolete.

          (g)  Each Non-U.S. Lender agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Borrower from and against any Taxes imposed by or on behalf of the United States
or any taxing jurisdiction thereof, penalties, additions to tax, fines, interest
or other liabilities, costs or losses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses) incurred or payable by such Borrower as a result
of the failure of such Borrower to comply with its obligations to deduct or
withhold any Taxes imposed by or on behalf of the United States or any taxing
jurisdiction thereof (including penalties, additions to tax, fines or interest
on such Taxes) from any payments made pursuant to this Agreement to such Non-
U.S. Lender or the Administrative Agent which failure resulted from (i) such
Borrower's reliance on Exhibit F pursuant to Section 2.18(e) or (ii) such Lender
being a "conduit entity" within the meaning of Treasury Reg. Section 1.881-3 or
any successor provision thereto; and, provided additionally, that, without
limitation, no amounts shall be due and owing to such Lender pursuant to Section
2.18 if either provisions (i) or (ii) are applicable. Notwithstanding any other
provision of Section 2.18(e), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver
any form or statement pursuant to Section 2.18(e) that such Non-U.S. Lender is
not legally able to deliver.

          (h)  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a refund in
respect of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by a Borrower, which in the reasonable good
faith judgment of such Lender is allocable to such payment, it shall promptly
pay such refund, together with any other amounts paid by such Borrower in
connection with such refunded Taxes or Other Taxes, to such Borrower, net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender incurred in obtaining such refund,
provided, however, that each Borrower agrees to promptly return such refund to
--------  -------
the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender as the case may be, if it
receives notice from the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender that such
Administrative Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund.


     SECTION 2.19.  Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
                    -----------------------------------------------------------
(a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or
under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.16,
2.17 or 2.18, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or
under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, local time), on the date when due, in
immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at its Administrative
Office, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The Administrative Agent
shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other
Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any
payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business
Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be
payable for the period of such extension. Except as otherwise specified in this
Agreement, each such payment (other than principal of and interest on Qualified
Global Currency Loans and LC Disbursements denominated in an Alternative
Currency, which shall be made in the applicable Qualified Global Currency or,
except as otherwise specified in Section 2.5(e), Alternative Currency, as the
case may be) shall be made in dollars.

                                       52
<PAGE>

          (b)  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed
LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations
                                   --------
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Parent
Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees,
to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder that such
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders the amount
due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then
each relevant Lender severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in
the relevant currency (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error).

          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Lender,
then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any
contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

     SECTION 2.20.  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any
                    ----------------------------------------------
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if any Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any

                                       53
<PAGE>

Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.18, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.18,
as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if any
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then such
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.4), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) such Borrower or
                                              --------
the Parent Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld and (ii)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts).
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling a Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

     SECTION 2.21.  Change in Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                    -------------
Agreement, if, after the date hereof, (a) any Change in Law shall make it
unlawful for any Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit denominated in an
Alternative Currency, or any Global Revolving Lender to make Global Revolving
Loans denominated in a Qualified Global Currency, or any Canadian Lender to
accept Canadian B/As, or (b) there shall have occurred any change in national or
international financial, political or economic conditions (including the
imposition of or any change in exchange controls) or currency exchange rates
that would make it impracticable for any Issuing Lender to issue Letters of
Credit denominated in such Alternative Currency for the account of a Borrower,
or any Global Revolving Lender to make Global Revolving Loans denominated in a
Qualified Global Currency, or any Canadian Lender to accept Canadian B/As, then
by prompt written notice thereof to the Parent Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such
circumstances no longer exist), (i) such Issuing Lender may declare that Letters
of Credit will not thereafter be issued by it in the affected Alternative
Currency or Alternative Currencies, whereupon the affected Alternative Currency
or Alternative Currencies shall be deemed (for the duration of such declaration)
not to constitute an Alternative Currency for purposes of the issuance of
Letters of Credit by such Issuing Lender, (ii) such Global Revolving Lender may
declare that Global Revolving Loans will not thereafter be made by it in the
affected Qualified Global Currency or Qualified Global Currencies, whereupon the
affected Qualified Global Currency or Qualified Global Currencies shall be
deemed (for the duration of such declaration) not to constitute a Qualified
Global Currency for purposes of the making of Global Revolving Loans by such
Global Revolving Lender and (iii) the commitment of such Canadian Lender
hereunder to accept Canadian B/As and continue Canadian B/As as such shall
forthwith be cancelled (for the duration of such declaration) and such Lender's
Canadian B/As, if any, shall (on the respective last days of the then current
Canadian Contract Periods or within such earlier period as required by law) be
converted automatically to Eurocurrency Borrowings having an Interest Period of
one month.

                                       54
<PAGE>

     SECTION 2.22.  Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers. Subject to the consent of the
                    ----------------------------
Administrative Agent, the Parent Borrower may designate any Foreign Subsidiary
of the Parent Borrower as a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such
Subsidiary, the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent and upon such
delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement until the Parent Borrower
shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing
Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such
Subsidiary shall cease to be a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary
Termination will become effective as to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower at a
time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to such Foreign Subsidiary
Borrower shall be outstanding hereunder, provided that such Borrowing Subsidiary
                                         --------
Termination shall be effective to terminate such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower's
right to make further borrowings under this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                        ------------------------------

          The Parent Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders that:

     SECTION 3.1.  Organization; Powers. Each of the Parent Borrower and its
                   --------------------
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has all requisite power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and (c) except where the

been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder
action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Borrower and

any Lien on any asset of the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except
Liens created under the Loan Documents.

Agreement will constitute "Guarantor Senior Indebtedness" (or any comparable

each Mortgaged Property and each parcel of real estate owned by Domestic
Subsidiaries of UDI that is required to become a Mortgaged Property pursuant to
Section 5.11(c). Each Mortgage constitutes a fully perfected Lien on, and

Mortgaged Properties referred to therein and the proceeds thereof, as security
for the Obligations (as defined in the relevant Mortgage), in each case, subject
to Permitted Encumbrances, prior and superior in right to any other Person.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                           THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
                           ------------------------

          Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative
Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions
on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto.  For the purposes of Article 2692 of the
Civil Code of Quebec and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Canadian Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each of the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent in its capacity as agent and
holder of a power of attorney of each such Canadian Lender under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

          The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.2), and (c) except as expressly
set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is
communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any
of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.2) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative
Agent shall not be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Parent
Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in
connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan
Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any

                                       79
<PAGE>

condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than
to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor to the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Parent Borrower.  Upon any
such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation
with the Parent Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder.  The fees payable by any Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Parent Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative
Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.3
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent,
its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as
Administrative Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any of their
respective affiliates and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any of their
respective affiliates and based on such documents and information as it shall
from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking
or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

          Neither the Syndication Agent nor any Documentation Agent shall have
any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.

     SECTION 9.2.   Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
                    -------------------
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or
under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan
Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this
Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not
be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of
whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of such Default at the time.

          (b)    Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the

                                       81
<PAGE>

written consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall
                                         --------
(i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such
Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of or subordinate the principal of any
Loan or LC Disbursement, or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any
fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees
payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive, excuse or subordinate any
such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment,
without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv)
require any Lender to make Loans having an Interest Period of one year or
longer, without the written consent of such Lender, (v) reduce the amount of Net
Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow required to be applied to prepay Loans under this
Agreement, without the written consent of the Majority Facility Lenders under
each Facility, (vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement in
any manner that would change the application of mandatory prepayments hereunder
without the written consent of the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of each
Facility adversely affected thereby, (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision
of Section 2.12 without the written consent of the Majority Facility Lenders in
respect of each Facility adversely affected thereby, (viii) change any of the
provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other
provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
(or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights
thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without
the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case
may be), (ix) release or subordinate all or substantially all of the Guarantees
from the Guarantors under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (except as
expressly provided in the Loan Documents), without the written consent of each
Lender, or (x) release or subordinate all or substantially all of the Liens of
the Security Documents on the Collateral (except as expressly provided in the
Loan Documents), without the written consent of each Lender.

     SECTION 9.3.   Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Parent Borrower
                    ----------------------------------
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or
waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be consummated), including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent, with statements with
respect to the foregoing to be submitted to the Parent Borrower prior to the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date (in the case of amounts to be paid on the
Amendment/Restatement Effective Date) and from time to time thereafter on a
quarterly basis or such other periodic basis as the Administrative Agent shall
deem appropriate, (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any
Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including
the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent
or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or
in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder,
including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

          (b)    The Parent Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each
such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee
                             ----------
harmless from, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance and administration of any Loan Document or any other
agreement, letter or

                                       82
<PAGE>

instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use
of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Lender to honor a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in
connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter
of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by the
Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability
related in any way to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv)
any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
                                                                    --------
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

          (c)    To the extent that the Parent Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the
Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined
as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or
                               --------
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, such Issuing
Lender or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a
Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of
the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at
the time; provided that in the case of amounts owing to any Issuing Lender or
          --------
the Swingline Lender, in each case in its capacity as such, a Lender's "pro
rata" share shall be determined based solely upon its share of the sum of
Domestic Revolving Exposures and unused Domestic Revolving Commitments at the
time.

          (d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

          (e)    All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later
than 15 days after written demand therefor. Statements payable by the Parent
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be sent to Attention of Treasurer and
Chief Financial Officer (Telephone No. 231-724-5000) (Telecopy No. 231-724-
5302), at the address of the Parent Borrower set forth in Section 9.1, or to
such other Person or address as may be hereafter designated by the Parent
Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative Agent.

     SECTION 9.4.   Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
                    ----------------------
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that a Borrower may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment
or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                                       83
<PAGE>

          (b)    Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i)
                                                          --------
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of
the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent must give their prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender
Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not (x) in the case of an assignment of a Revolving
Commitment, Revolving Loan or Tranche A Term Loan, be less than $5,000,000, and
(y) in the case of an assignment of a Tranche B Term Loan or a Tranche C Term
Loan, be less than $1,000,000, unless the Parent Borrower and the Administrative
Agent otherwise consent, (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with
a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee need not be paid in the
case of any assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender), (iv) the
assignee, if not already a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire, (v) no assignment of Global Revolving Commitments
or Global Revolving Loans may be made to an assignee that cannot make Loans in
each of the Qualified Global Currencies (other than Canadian dollars) and (vi)
no assignment of Canadian Commitments or Canadian Dollar Loans may be made to an
assignee that cannot make Loans in each of the Qualified Global Currencies; and
provided further that any consent of any Borrower otherwise required under this
----------------
paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under paragraph (a), (b),
(h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Any such assignment
need not be ratable as among the Facilities. Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 9.3). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

          (c)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
of the Parent Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New
York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment
of, and principal amount of the Loans (whether or not evidenced by a promissory
note) and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
                        --------
conclusive, and each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary.

          (d)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee is already a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. Any assignment or
transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a promissory note shall be
registered as to both principal and interest on the Register

                                       84
<PAGE>

only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the promissory
note evidencing such loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and
Acceptance, and thereupon one or more new promissory notes in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the designated Assignee and the old
promissory notes shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Parent
Borrower marked "cancelled".

          (e)    Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
    -----------
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
              --------
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) each
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall any Participant under any
such participation have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any
provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan
Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent
would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees payable
hereunder, or postpone the date of the final maturity of the Loans, in each case
to the extent subject to such participation. Subject to paragraph (f) of this
Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section, provided that, in the case of Section 2.18, such Participant shall
              --------
have complied with the requirements of said section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.8 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
                         --------
Section 2.19(c) as though it were a Lender.

          (f)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.16 or 2.18 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Parent
Borrower's prior written consent.

          (g)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
                                   --------
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In
the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans, such Lender
may, without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, assign or
pledge all or any portion of any instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender
under this Agreement to any trustee for, or any other representative of, holders
of obligations owed or securities issued, by such fund, as security for such
obligations or securities; provided that any foreclosure or similar action by
                           --------
such trustee or representative shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.4 concerning assignments.

     SECTION 9.5.   Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
                    --------
warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or
warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in
full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any
Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this

                                       85
<PAGE>

Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and
so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of
Sections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 9.3 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

     SECTION 9.6.   Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be executed in
                    -------------------------
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Document and
any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
(including the Lenders) and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.7.   Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
                    ------------
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

     SECTION 9.8.   Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
                    ---------------
and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of a Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of a Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

     SECTION 9.9.   Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
                    ----------------------------------------------------------
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of New York.

          (b)  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any
Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                                       86
<PAGE>

          (c)  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, (i) any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section, (ii) the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court and (iii) any right it may have to claim or recover in any
legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section any special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages.

          (d)  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.1. In addition, each
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower agrees that service of process may be effected by
mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially
similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Parent Borrower at its address
for notices in Section 9.1. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

     SECTION 9.10.  Acknowledgements. The Parent Borrower hereby acknowledges
                    ----------------
that:

          (a)  it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
     delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

          (b)  neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary
     relationship with or duty to the Parent Borrower arising out of or in
     connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the
     relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the
     Parent Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is
     solely that of debtor and creditor; and

          (c)  no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents
     or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among
     the Lenders or among the Borrowers and the Lenders.

     SECTION 9.11.  Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
                    --------
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

     SECTION 9.12.  Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
                    ---------------
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Related Parties,

Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) to
any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in Hedging Agreements or other
swap agreements relating to this Agreement or such counterparty's professional
advisor, (h) with the consent of the Parent Borrower, and (i) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower. For the purposes
of this Section, "Information" means all information received from any Borrower
relating to a Borrower or its business,

                                       87
<PAGE>

other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such Borrower;
provided that such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
--------
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to

     SECTION 9.13.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
                    --------------------
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

     SECTION 9.14.  Release of Collateral. On the first date (the "Release
                    ---------------------                          -------
Date") on which the outstanding Indebtedness under this Agreement is rated
----
"Baa3" or better by Moody's and "BBB-" or better by S&P, so long as no Event of
Default exists on such date, all Collateral (other than Pledged Stock (as
defined in each of the Collateral Agreements)) shall be released from the Liens
created by the Collateral Agreements (all such released Collateral being the
"Released Collateral"), all without delivery of any instrument or performance of
 -------------------
any act by any party, and all rights to the Released Collateral shall revert to
the Loan Parties. At the request and sole expense of any Loan Party following
any such release, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to such Loan Party any
Released Collateral held by the Collateral Agent under the Collateral
Agreements, and execute and deliver to such Loan Party such documents as such
Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such release.

     SECTION 9.15.  Amendment of Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. Each party
                    -----------------------------------------------
hereto, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement or an Addendum in the
form of Exhibit E, hereby consents to the amendment to the Guarantee and
Collateral Agreement provided for in the Consent and Confirmation.

     SECTION 9.16.  Judgment Currency. (a) The Borrowers' obligations hereunder
                    -----------------
and under the other Loan Documents to make payments in a specified currency (the
"Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender or
 -------------------
recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into any currency
other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or
recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent or a
Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to
the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any
Loan Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert
into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other
currency being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due
                                               -----------------
in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the rate of
exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent
does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such
currency designated by the Administrative Agent) determined, in each case, as of
the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the judgment is given
(such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency
                                                         -----------------
Conversion Date").
---------------

<PAGE>

          (b)  If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between
the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, the Borrowers covenant and agree to pay, or cause to be paid, such
additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount), as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.

          (c)  For purposes of determining any rate of exchange or currency
equivalent for this Section, such amounts shall include any premium and costs
payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
