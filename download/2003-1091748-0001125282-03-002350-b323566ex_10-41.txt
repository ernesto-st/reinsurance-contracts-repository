         Re: Retention Bonus

Dear Bruce:

         As I discussed with you on December 10, 2001, PXRE Reinsurance Company
(the "Company") has agreed to pay the following retention bonus (the "Rentention
Bonus") to you:

                  Bonus Amount                       Bonus Payment Date
                  ------------                       -------------------
                  $82,500                            January 31, 2002
                  $82,500                            January 31, 2003


         As a condition to the payment of each portion of the Bonus Amount, you
must be in the continuous employ of the Company or its affiliates between now
and each Bonus Payment Date in order to receive the Bonus Amount payable on such
date.

         The Company and any affiliate reserves the right to terminate your
employment with the Company or any affiliate at any time for any reason and no
contract or right to continued employment shall be implied by this letter
agreement.

         This letter agreement: (a) shall be in binding upon and inure to the
benefit of any successor of the Company; (b) shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York and any applicable laws of the United States; and (c) may
not be amended except in writing.
