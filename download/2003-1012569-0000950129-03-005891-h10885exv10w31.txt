         (b)      Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Heritage MLP shall
prepare an unaudited statement (the "Final Statement") of the ETC OLP Accounts
Payable as of the close of business on the Closing Date, such Final Statement to
be prepared in the following manner:

                  (i)      Heritage MLP shall deliver to La Grange the Final
         Statement, fairly presenting the ETC OLP Accounts Payable as of the
         close of business on the Closing Date. The Final Statement shall be
         accompanied by a report setting forth (A) the ETC OLP Accounts Payable,
         in reasonable detail, as reflected in the Final Statement, and (B) the
         amount of any difference between the ETC OLP Accounts Payable as
         reflected on the Final Statement and the Estimated ETC OLP Accounts
         Payable, to whom such difference is to be paid and the basis therefore.
         The principles of presentation in the Final Statement shall be the same
         as those presented in determining the Estimated ETC OLP Accounts
         Payable at Closing.

                  (ii)     Following the Closing, Heritage MLP, on the one hand,
         and La Grange, on the other hand, shall deliver to each other and each
         other's authorized representatives, if any, full access at all
         reasonable times to the properties, books, records and personnel of the
         La Grange Entities relating to periods prior to the Closing Date for
         purposes of preparing, reviewing and resolving any disputes concerning
         the Final Statement. La Grange shall have 30 days following delivery of
         the Final Statement during which to notify Heritage MLP of any dispute
         of any item contained in the Final Statement, which notice shall set
         forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. If La Grange
         fails to notify Heritage MLP of any such dispute within such 30-day
         period, the Final Statement shall be deemed to be accepted. If La
         Grange shall so notify Heritage MLP of any dispute, La Grange and
         Heritage MLP shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as
         promptly as possible.

                  (iii)    If Heritage MLP and La Grange are unable to resolve
         any such dispute within 30 days of La Grange's delivery of such notice
         (the "Resolution Period"), then all amounts remaining in dispute shall
         be submitted to such nationally recognized accounting firm as shall be
         reasonably acceptable to Heritage MLP and La Grange (the "Independent
         Accounting Firm") within 10 days after the expiration of the Resolution
         Period. Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent
         Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter. All fees and expenses
         relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent
         Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Heritage MLP and La Grange.
         The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to
         determine, based solely on presentations by Heritage MLP and La Grange,
         and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute and
         shall be limited to those adjustments, if any, that need be made for
         the Final Statement to comply with the standards set forth in this
         Section 2.6(b)(iii). The Independent Accounting Firm's determination
         shall be requested to be made within 30 days of their selection, shall
         be set forth in a written statement delivered to Heritage MLP and La
         Grange and shall be final, binding and conclusive.

                                       12
<PAGE>

         The Final Statement, as modified by resolution of any disputes by
         Heritage MLP and La Grange or by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall
         be the "Final Statement."

         (c)      Heritage MLP shall pay, or cause to be paid, to La Grange, the
amount by which the Estimated ETC OLP Accounts Payable exceeds the ETC OLP
Accounts Payable as set forth in the Final Statement, and La Grange shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Heritage MLP the amount by which the Estimated ETC OLP
Accounts Payable is less than the ETC OLP Accounts Payable as set forth in the

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE HERITAGE PARTIES

         For the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Heritage Parties,
jointly and severally, represents and warrants as set forth in this Article 3.
The Heritage Parties do not make any representations and warranties in this
Article 3 with respect to the La Grange Entities.

or otherwise hold and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, and in the case of Heritage GP, to act as

Heritage GP is duly qualified and in good standing to do business as a foreign
general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or
corporation, as applicable, in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Heritage Material Adverse Effect.

         3.2      CAPITALIZATION OF THE HERITAGE ENTITIES.

         (a)      All of the outstanding Common Units, Class C Units and

and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303 and 17-607 of the Delaware LP Act) and will be
issued free and clear of any lien, claim or Encumbrance.

         (c)      Each Heritage Entity (other than Heritage MLP and Heritage

outstanding share (or other percentage ownership interests) of Capital Stock of
any Heritage Entity which Heritage MLP directly or indirectly owns other than
(i) the Encumbrances, if any, set forth in Schedule 3.2(c), and (ii) Permitted
Encumbrances. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.2(c), Heritage MLP does not own,
of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly through any Person, and does
not control, directly or indirectly through any Person or otherwise, any Capital
Stock or derivative securities of any entity other than a Heritage Entity. All
of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock of the Heritage Entities that are
corporations or limited liability companies have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding
shares of Capital Stock of the Heritage Entities that are general or limited
partnerships have been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with
such Heritage Entity's partnership agreement and such Capital Stock has been
fully paid for (to the extent required under such Heritage Entity's partnership
agreement and the Heritage OLP Partnership Agreement, as applicable, ) and is
nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303 and 17-607 of the Delaware LP Act or similar
partnership laws of its Organization State).

         (d)      Except (i) as described in the SEC Reports, (ii) arising under
any Heritage Plan, and (iii) for the Common Units, Class D Units and Special
Units to be issued pursuant to this Agreement and the Class E Units to be issued
to HHI in exchange for the Common Units currently held by HHI, there are no
preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase, nor any
restriction upon the voting or transfer of, any interests in Heritage MLP or
Heritage OLP pursuant to the Heritage MLP Partnership Agreement or the agreement
of limited partnership of Heritage OLP as amended by Amendment No. 1 and No. 2
thereto (the "Heritage OLP Partnership Agreement") or any other agreement or
instrument to which Heritage MLP or Heritage OLP is a party or by which either
of them may be bound. Neither the offering nor the sale of the Common Units,
Class D Units or Special Units, as contemplated by this Agreement, or the
issuance of Class E Units to HHI, gives rise to any rights for or relating to
the registration

                                       14
<PAGE>

of any Common Units or other securities of Heritage MLP or Heritage OLP, except

amended by Amendment No. 5 thereto prior to the Closing. As of the Closing Date,
all corporate and partnership action, as the case may be, required to be taken
by the Heritage Parties or any of their respective stockholders or partners for
the authorization, issuance, sale and delivery of the Common Units, Class D
Units and Special Units shall have been validly taken, and no other
authorization by any of such parties is required therefore.

Heritage Parties has full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents (collectively, the "Heritage

contemplated thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by Heritage GP and
the Heritage Parties of the Heritage Documents, and the consummation by them of

Entities pursuant to any agreement or instrument to which the La Grange Entities
or La Grange is a party or by which any of them may be bound. Neither the

operation of the La Grange Business prior to the Closing Date. The Heritage
Parties shall afford such access upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and

and records as they may select. La Grange shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 6.4.

         6.5      FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, La Grange shall pay the fees and expenses of La Grange and the
La Grange Entities, and the Heritage Parties shall pay the fees and expenses of
the Heritage Entities, incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution

         6.7      EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.

         (c)      Other Employment Matters. Except for accrued vacation time, no
other La Grange Employee-related liability or La Grange Plan liability,

conditions set forth in Article 6.8 hereof or (B) compliance by the Heritage
Parties and La Grange with their respective covenants and agreements set forth
herein.

         6.9      ACTIONS BY PARTIES. Each Party agrees to use commercially
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in

taking any action within its control that would cause a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

         6.10     VOTE OF COMMON UNITS. Heritage GP shall use Commercially
Reasonable Best Efforts to cause its officers and directors to vote all of their

may be required by Heritage MLP in order to make timely filings in compliance
thereunder.

assist in the filing of proxy solicitation materials relating to matters
contemplated hereby requiring a vote of the holders of the outstanding Common

         6.14     CONFIDENTIALITY AND TAX SHELTER REGULATIONS. Except as
reasonably necessary to comply with applicable securities laws and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including the
confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 6.1) or in any other agreement
to which a Party hereto is bound, the Parties hereto (and each employee,
representative, or other agent of any of the Parties) are expressly authorized
to disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S.
federal income "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (as those terms are defined
in Treas. Reg. Sections 1.6011-4(c)(8) and (9), respectively) of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such parties
relating to such "tax treatment" and "tax structure" of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For these purposes, "tax structure" is limited
to facts relevant to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the transaction
described herein.

         6.15     PERMITTED ACTIONS. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.5 above, the Heritage Parties and the Heritage GP (but only with respect to
the Heritage Parties) shall be entitled to take any action otherwise prohibited
by Section 5.5 in response to any third party inquiry, contact or proposal
received by them if (a) the Special Committee shall have determined, in its good
faith judgment, that any such otherwise prohibited action may lead to the

                                       48

<PAGE>

negotiation and consummation of a sale or other transaction involving the
assets, business or securities of the Heritage Parties or any other transaction
similar to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, a
"Possible Alternative") that in the opinion of the Special Committee may be more
beneficial than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taken as a
whole, to the holders of the Common Units (a "Superior Transaction") and (b) the
Special Committee shall have determined, after consultation with and based on
the advice of its legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Heritage GP's Board of Directors' fiduciary duties to
holders of the Common Units under applicable law; provided, that none of the
Heritage GP (but only with respect to the Heritage Parties) or the Heritage
Parties may execute a binding agreement to effect a Superior Transaction unless
this Agreement has first been terminated as provided in Section 8.1. The
Heritage GP (but only with respect to the Heritage Parties) and the Heritage
Parties agree that each of them will notify La Grange immediately if any
inquiry, contact or proposal is received by, any such information is requested
from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, any of their representatives, and thereafter shall keep La
Grange informed, on a current basis, on the status of any such inquiry, contact
or proposal and the status of any such negotiations or discussions.

         (c)      by any Party if the Closing has not occurred on or before

Agreement by the Party or its Affiliate seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(c);

         (d)      by any Party if (i) there is any statute, rule or regulation

of the La Grange Business or Heritage Business illegal or otherwise prohibited
or (ii) a Governmental Authority (A) has issued an order, decree or ruling or

any order, decree, ruling or other action consenting to or approving
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby contingent or conditional
in any manner that has a Heritage Material Adverse Effect or a La Grange
Material Adverse Effect;

         (e)      by any Party, if there has been any violation or breach by any
other Party (other than an Affiliate or related party of the first party) of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that
has rendered impossible the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
such other Party set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 and such violation or
breach has neither been cured within 30 days after notice by such first Party to
the other Party nor waived by the first Party;

         (f)      by any Party, if any other event shall occur that shall render

         (j)      by La Grange, if the general partner of La Grange reasonably
determines at any time after January 10, 2004 that it is not possible for the
Heritage Parties to fulfill any of the conditions described in Sections 7.1(m),
7.1(n) or 7.1(o) on or before the Closing Date on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to La Grange; and

         (k)      by the Heritage Parties acting through the Special Committee,

         8.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 by any Party, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made. Except as provided in Section 8.5 of this
Agreement, in the event of termination of this Agreement for any reason, this
Agreement and the Acquisition Agreement shall become void and have no effect,
except that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 and Section 8.5 and in
Section 6.5 and Article 10 shall survive the termination hereof. Nothing
contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement. In the event of termination, each of the
Parties shall be responsible for its own expenses and costs.

delivered pursuant hereto, (b) waive compliance by any other Party (other than
an Affiliate or related party of the first party) with any of its agreements
contained herein and (c) waive fulfillment of any conditions to its obligations
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of
such Party. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

         8.5      PAYMENT UPON CERTAIN TERMINATION. If this Agreement is
terminated by the Heritage Parties pursuant to Section 8.1(k), Heritage MLP

                           SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

         9.1      INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF LA GRANGE.

         (a)      La Grange shall indemnify each of the Heritage Parties and any
of their owners, partners, officers, agents and their respective Affiliates and
controlling Persons (the "Heritage Indemnified Parties"), as the case may be,
and hold such Persons harmless against and in respect of, any and all Losses
arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

                  (i)      the breach of any representation or warranty of La
         Grange contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (other than
         breaches and warranties set forth in Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section
         4.7, Section 4.19, and Section 4.23);

                  (ii)     the breach of any representation or warranty of La
         Grange contained in or made pursuant to Section 4.19 [Environmental
         Matters], and Section 4.23 [Investment Intent];

                  (iii)    the breach of any representation or warranty of La
         Grange contained in or made pursuant to Section 4.2 [Capitalization of
         the La Grange Entities], Section 4.3 [Authority and Binding Agreement],
         and Section 4.7 [Title to La Grange Assets],; and

                  (iv)     the breach by La Grange or the failure by La Grange
         to observe or perform in any material respect, any of their covenants
         or agreements contained in Section 5.6, Section 5.7, Section 6.4,
         Section 6.5, Section 6.6, Section 6,10, Section 6.12, Section 6.13,
         Section 6.14 or Article 10 of this Agreement.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, La Grange will not have any
obligation to indemnify any of the Heritage Parties or their Affiliates for
Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(a)(ii) unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section
9.1(a)(ii) exceeds $500,000 (regardless of whether, in the case of third party
actions, suits or proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, La Grange
may have a meritorious defense), at and after which time La Grange shall be
liable for all Losses in excess of $500,000 and which do not in the aggregate
exceed $10,000,000; provided however, that any liabilities for which accruals
have been made by La Grange on the La Grange Financial Statement shall be
excluded in determining whether losses exceed $500,000. The rights and remedies
of the Heritage Parties based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of
any clause of this Section 9.1 or any representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission,
occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such claim is based may also
be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement that would not give rise to any rights or remedies of the Heritage
Parties.

         9.2      INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE HERITAGE PARTIES.

         (a)      The Heritage Parties shall, jointly and severally, indemnify
La Grange and any of its owners, partners, officers, agents and their respective
Affiliates and controlling Persons (the "La Grange Indemnified Parties"), as the
case may be, and hold such Persons harmless against and in respect of any and
all Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

<PAGE>

                  (i)      the breach of any representation or warranty of the
         Heritage Parties contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (other
         than breaches and warranties set forth in Section 3.2, Section 3.3,
         Section 3.7, and Section 3.19);

                  (ii)     the breach of any representation or warranty of the
         Heritage Parties contained in or made pursuant to Section 3.19
         [Environmental Matters];

                  (iii)    the breach of any representations or warranty of the
         Heritage Parties contained in or made pursuant to Section 3.2
         [Capitalization of the Heritage Entities], Section 3.3 [Authority and
         Binding Agreement], Section 3.7 [Title to Heritage Assets], and

                  (iv)     the breach by the Heritage Parties or the failure by
         the Heritage Parties to observe or perform in any material respect, any
         of its covenants or agreements contained in Section 5.6, Section 5.7,
         Section 6.4, Section 6.5, Section 6.6, Section 6,10, Section 6.12,
         Section 6.13, Section 6.14 or Article 10 of this Agreement.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Heritage Parties will not
have any obligation to indemnify La Grange or its Affiliates for Losses under
Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(a)(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses under Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(a)(ii) exceeds $500,000
(regardless of whether, in the case of third party actions, suits or proceedings
with respect to any of the foregoing, the Heritage Parties may have a
meritorious defense), at and after which time the Heritage Parties shall be
liable for all Losses in excess of $500,000 and which do not in the aggregate
exceed $10,000,000; provided however, that any liabilities for which accruals
have been made by the Heritage Parties on the Heritage Financial Statements
shall be excluded in determining whether losses exceed $500,000. The rights and
remedies of La Grange based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any
clause of this Section 9.2 or any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission,
occurrence or other state of facts upon which any such claim is based may also
be the subject matter of any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement that would not give rise to any rights or remedies of La Grange.

         9.3      INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

         (a)      Promptly upon receipt by a Party indemnified under this
Article 9 (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of any action
against such Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Action") in respect of which
indemnity or reimbursement may be sought against a party required to make
indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement of such Third
Party Action, but the failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve it of any liability which it may have to any Heritage Indemnified Party
under Section 9.1 or any La Grange Indemnified Party under Section 9.2, as
applicable, unless such failure actually and materially adversely affects the
defense of such Third Party Action. In case notice of commencement of any such
Third Party Action shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as above provided,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the
defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that:

                                       56

<PAGE>

                  (i)      the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
         participate in the defense of such Third Party Action and to employ
         counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such Third
         Party Action (provided that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
         reimbursement for such expenses in accordance with subclauses (A) and
         (B) below in Section 9.3(b));

                  (ii)     the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
         approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed, before entering into any settlement
         of such Third Party Action or ceasing to defend against such Third
         Party Action, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
         cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would be imposed
         against the Indemnified Party or the Indemnified Party would be
         adversely affected thereby;

                  (iii)    no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of
         any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
         unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to
         each Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of
         such Third Party Action; and

                  (iv)     the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
         control the defense of any Third Party Action unless within 15 days
         after receipt of such written notice from the Indemnified Party, the
         Indemnifying Party confirms in writing its responsibility to indemnify
         the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Action and
         reasonably demonstrates that it will be able to pay the full amount of
         the reasonably expected Losses in connection with any such Third Party
         Action.

         (b)      Except as set forth in the following sentence, after written
notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to
assume control of the defense of any such Third Party Action in accordance with
the foregoing and compliance by the Indemnifying Party with Section 9.3(d), (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder
for any fees and expenses of counsel subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Party attributable to defending against such Third Party Action, and (ii) as
long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting such Third Party Action
in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge the claim underlying, such Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If (A) the Indemnifying
Party does not assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action in
accordance with this Section 9.3, or (B) the Indemnified Party has been advised
in writing by counsel that representation of such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Action on behalf of
the Indemnified Party), in each case the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend and/or settle such Third Party Action in such manner as it may deem
appropriate at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party therefore in
accordance with this Article 9. The reimbursement of fees and expenses of
counsel required by this Article 9 shall be made by periodic payments during the
course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or
expenses incurred.

                                       57

<PAGE>

         (c)      If the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party with respect to the claims to
which such indemnification relates. If an Indemnified Party becomes entitled to
any indemnification from an Indemnifying Party, such indemnification shall be
made in cash upon demand.

         (d)      The right of indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the Parties to this
Agreement and their respective Affiliates, managers, directors, officers,
members, employees and other agents and representatives, other than with respect
to fraud or willful breach by a Party. So long as a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 is being contested in good faith by the Indemnifying
Party or such claim shall otherwise remain unliquidated, such claim shall not
affect any of the rights of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

         9.4      SURVIVAL.

         (a)      All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement other than those set forth in Article 9 hereof,
shall expire with and be terminated and extinguished by the Closing, and
thereafter no Party nor any of such Party's owners, partners, officers, agents,
and Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements conducted by any Party and any information
which any Party may receive (other than information identified in the Schedules
to this Agreement).

         (b)      The right to indemnification:

                  (i)      with respect to any breach or violation of any of the

         years following the Closing;

         survive for one year following the Closing;

                  (iii)    with respect to any breach or violation of any of the
         representations and warranties contained in Section 3.2,
         [Capitalization of the Heritage Entities], Section 3.3, [Authority and
         Binding Agreement], Section 4.2 [Capitalization of the La Grange
         Entities], Section 4.3 [Authority and Binding Agreement], and Section
         4.23 [Investment Intent], shall survive indefinitely; and

                  (iv)     and with respect to any of the covenants and
         agreements contained in Section 5.6, Section 5.7, Section 6.4, Section
         6.5, Section 6.6, Section 6.10, Section 6.12, Section 6.13, Section

         statute of limitations.

         (c)      The expiration of any survival period under this Agreement
will not affect the liability of any Party under this Article 9 for any Loss as
to which a bona fide claim has been asserted prior to the termination of such
survival period.

Notices and other communications shall be deemed given or made (i) when
received, if sent by telegram, telefax, telex or similar facsimile means
(written confirmation of such receipt by confirmed facsimile transmission being
deemed receipt of communications sent by telefax, telex or similar facsimile
means) and (ii) when delivered and receipted for (or upon the date of attempted
delivery where delivery is refused), if hand-delivered, sent by registered or
certified mail or sent by express courier or delivery service, except in the
case of facsimile transmissions received after the normal close of business at
the receiving location, which shall be deemed given on the next Business Day.

         10.2     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto (where applicable, as
executed and delivered), constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

         10.3     BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFIT. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent
of each of the Parties, and any purported assignment without such consent shall
be void. Except as provided in Article 9 nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the Parties,
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

         10.4     SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement shall be considered divisible and such provision
shall be deemed inoperative to the extent it is deemed unenforceable, and in all
other respects this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; provided,
however, that if any such provision may be made enforceable by limitation
thereof, then such provision shall be deemed to be so limited and shall be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

         10.5     GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

         10.6     JURISDICTION. Any legal action, suit or proceeding in law or
equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may only be instituted in any state or federal
court located in the State of Texas, and each Party agrees not to

                                       60

<PAGE>

assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, suit or
proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
such court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court.
Each Party further irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in
any such action, suit or proceeding. Any and all service of process and any
other notice in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be effective against
any Party if given by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or
by any other means which requires a signed receipt in accordance with, and at
the address listed in, Section 10.1. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

         10.7     FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time following the Closing,
at the request of any Party and without further consideration, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to such requesting Party such instruments and
documents and take such other action as such requesting Party may reasonably
request or as may be otherwise necessary to (a) more fully and effectively
transfer to, and vest in, the Heritage Parties, the La Grange Interests and the
La Grange Assets, (b) enable the Heritage Parties or the La Grange Entities to
assume and fully and timely perform in accordance with their terms any or all of
the La Grange Contracts, (c) enable the Heritage Parties or the La Grange
Entities to continue the La Grange Business, and (d) otherwise consummate more
fully and effectively the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Other Transaction Documents.

         10.8     DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

         10.9     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
