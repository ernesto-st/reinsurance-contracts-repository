                                Credit Agreement

To each of the Banks signatory hereto

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), applies to you for your several commitments, subject to all the
terms and conditions hereof and on the basis of the representations and
warranties hereinafter set forth, to make available a three-year revolving
credit for loans and letters of credit (the "Revolving Credit") and a swing line
(the "Swing Line") for loans, in each case as described herein.

Section 1.   The Credits.

     Section 1.1. The Revolving Credit Commitments. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each Bank, by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to make
a loan or loans (individually a "Revolving Loan" and collectively "Revolving
Loans") in U.S. Dollars to the Borrower from time to time on a revolving basis
up to the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment, on or after the Effective
Date and before the Termination Date. The aggregate principal amount of all
Revolving Loans, all Swing Loans and all L/C Obligations at any time outstanding
shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments in effect at such time. Each
Borrowing of Revolving Loans shall be made ratably from the Banks in proportion
to their respective Percentages. As provided in Section 1.5(a) hereof, the
Borrower may elect that each Borrowing of Revolving Loans be either Domestic
Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans. Revolving Loans may be repaid and the
principal amount thereof reborrowed before the Termination Date, subject to all
the terms and conditions hereof.

     Section 1.2. Letters of Credit. (a) General Terms. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, as part of the Revolving Credit, the L/C Issuer shall issue
standby or commercial letters of credit (each a "Letter of Credit") for the
account of the Borrower or for the account of the Borrower and one or more of
its Subsidiaries in U.S. Dollars; provided that the aggregate amount of the L/C
Obligations at any time outstanding shall not exceed the lesser of (i) L/C
Commitment and (ii) the difference between the Revolving Credit Commitments in
effect at such time and the aggregate principal amount of all Loans then
outstanding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Existing L/Cs
(all of which are listed and described on Schedule 1.2(a) hereto) shall each
constitute a "Letter of Credit" herein for all purposes of the Agreement to the
same extent, and with the same force and effect, as if such Existing L/Cs had
been issued at the request of the Borrower under the Revolving Credit. Each
Letter of Credit shall be issued by the L/C Issuer in the manner described
above, but each Bank shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer for its
Percentage of the amount of each drawing thereunder and, accordingly, the
undrawn face amount of each Letter of Credit shall constitute usage of the
Revolving Credit Commitment of each Bank pro rata in accordance with each Bank's
Percentage.

<PAGE>

     (b)  Applications. At any time on or after the Effective Date and before
the Termination Date, the L/C Issuer shall, at the request of the Borrower,
issue one or more Letters of Credit in U.S. Dollars, in a form satisfactory to
the L/C Issuer, with expiration dates no later than the earliest of (i) 12
months from the date of issuance or (ii) 365 days after the Termination Date, in
an aggregate face amount as set forth above, upon the receipt of an application
duly executed by the Borrower and, if such Letter of Credit is for the account
of one of its Subsidiaries, such Subsidiary for the relevant Letter of Credit in
the form customarily prescribed by the L/C Issuer for the type of Letter of
Credit, whether standby or commercial, requested (each an "Application");
provided, that with respect to any Letter of Credit with an expiration date that
is later than the Termination Date, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent no
later than 20 days prior to the Termination Date cash collateral in an amount
equal to the full amount then available for drawing under such Letter of Credit.
Any such cash collateral required by this Section 1.2(b) shall be held by the
Agent pursuant to the terms of Section 10.4 hereof. Notwithstanding anything
contained in any Application to the contrary (i) the Borrower's obligation to
pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit shall be as exclusively set
forth in Section 4.1(b) hereof, (ii) except during the continuance of an Event
of Default, the L/C Issuer will not call for the funding by the Borrower of any
amount under a Letter of Credit before being presented with a drawing
thereunder, and (iii) if the L/C Issuer is not timely reimbursed for the amount
of any drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date such drawing is paid, the
Borrower's obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of such drawing
shall bear interest (which the Borrower hereby promises to pay) from and after
the date such drawing is paid until payment in full thereof at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of 2% plus the Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans plus
the Domestic Rate from time to time in effect. The L/C Issuer will promptly
notify the Banks of each issuance by it of a Letter of Credit. If the L/C Issuer
issues any Letters of Credit with expiration dates that are automatically
extended under the terms set forth in such Letter of Credit, then the L/C Issuer
will give notice of non-renewal before the time necessary to prevent such
automatic extension if before such required notice date (i) the expiration date
of such Letter of Credit if so extended would be later than 365 days after the
Termination Date, (ii) the Commitments have been terminated or (iii) an Event of
Default exists and the Required Banks have given the L/C Issuer instructions not
to so permit the extension of the expiration date of such Letter of Credit. The
L/C Issuer agrees to issue amendments to the Letters of Credit increasing the
amount, or extending the expiration date, thereof at the request of the Borrower
subject to the conditions of Section 8.2 and the other terms of this Section
1.2. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer's
obligation to issue, amend or extend the expiration date of a Letter of Credit
is subject to the conditions of Section 8.2 and the other terms of this Section
1.2 and the L/C Issuer will not issue, amend or extend the expiration date of
any Letter of Credit if any Bank notifies the L/C Issuer of any failure to
satisfy or otherwise comply with such conditions and terms and directs the L/C
Issuer not to take such action.

     (c)  The Reimbursement Obligations. Subject to Section 1.2(b) hereof, the
obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for all drawings under a
Letter of Credit (a "Reimbursement Obligation") shall be governed by the
Application related to such Letter of Credit, except that, if and as long as no
Default or Event of Default exists and the other conditions in Section 8.2
hereof are satisfied, any Reimbursement Obligation outstanding on account of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit shall automatically convert into a Borrowing of
Domestic Rate Loans in an amount equal to such Reimbursement Obligation on the
date such

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

drawing occurs and the L/C Issuer shall notify the Agent and each Bank
thereof, and each Bank shall thereupon fund its Domestic Rate Loan in such
Borrowing in accordance with Sections 1.1 and 1.5 (except for any requirement
that a Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans be in a certain amount). If the
conditions in Section 8.2 cannot be satisfied with respect to any drawing, then
reimbursement of such drawing shall be made in U.S. Dollars in immediately
available funds at the Agent's principal office in Chicago, Illinois or such
other office as the Agent may designate in writing to the Borrower (who shall
thereafter cause to be distributed to the L/C Issuer such amount(s) in like
funds) by no later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date when such drawing
is paid or, if such drawing was paid after 11:30 a.m. (Chicago time), by the end
of such day. If the Borrower does not make any such reimbursement payment on the
date due and the Participating Banks fund their participations therein in the
manner set forth in Section 1.2(d) below, then all payments thereafter received
by the Agent in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall
be distributed in accordance with Section 1.2(d) below.

     (d)  The Participating Interests. Each Bank (other than the Bank then
acting as L/C Issuer in issuing Letters of Credit), by its acceptance hereof,
severally agrees to purchase from the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer hereby
agrees to sell to each such Bank (a "Participating Bank"), an undivided
percentage participating interest (a "Participating Interest"), to the extent of
its Percentage, in each Letter of Credit issued by, and each Reimbursement
Obligation owed to, the L/C Issuer. Upon any failure by the Borrower to pay any
Reimbursement Obligation at the time required on the date the related drawing is
paid, as set forth in Section 1.2(c) above, or if the L/C Issuer is required at
any time to return to the Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator,
custodian or other Person any portion of any payment of any Reimbursement
Obligation, each Participating Bank shall, not later than the Business Day it
receives a certificate in the form of Exhibit A hereto from the L/C Issuer to
such effect, if such certificate is received before 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time), or
not later than the following Business Day, if such certificate is received after
such time, pay to the Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer an amount equal to
its Percentage of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation together
with interest on such amount accrued from the date the related payment was made
by the L/C Issuer to the date of such payment by such Participating Bank at a
rate per annum equal to (i) from the date the related payment was made by the
L/C Issuer to the date two Business Days after payment by such Participating
Bank is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from
the date two Business Days after the date such payment is due from such
Participating Bank to the date such payment is made by such Participating Bank,
the Domestic Rate in effect for each such day. Each such Participating Bank
shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Percentage of each payment received
in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation and of interest paid
thereon, with the L/C Issuer retaining its Percentage thereof as a Bank
hereunder.

     The several obligations of the Participating Banks to the L/C Issuer under
this Section 1.2 shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and
all circumstances whatsoever (except, without limiting the Borrower's
obligations under each Application, to the extent the Borrower is relieved from
its obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer for a drawing under a Letter of
Credit because of the L/C Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct in
determining that documents received under the Letter of Credit comply with the
terms thereof) and shall not be subject to any set-off, counterclaim or defense
to payment which any Participating Bank may

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

have or have had against the Borrower, the L/C Issuer, any other Bank or any
other Person whatsoever.

     (e)  Indemnification. The Participating Banks shall, to the extent of their
respective Percentages, indemnify the L/C Issuer (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from the L/C Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct) that the
L/C Issuer may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit. The
obligations of the Participating Banks under this Section 1.2(e) and all other
parts of this Section 1.2 shall survive termination of this Agreement and of all
other L/C Documents.

     Section 1.3. Applicable Interest Rates. (a) Domestic Rate Loans. Each
Domestic Rate Loan made or maintained by a Bank shall bear interest during each
Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366
days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal
amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced, continued or created by
conversion from a Eurocurrency Loan until maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for
Domestic Rate Loans plus the Domestic Rate from time to time in effect, payable
on the last day of its Interest Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration
or otherwise).

     (b)  Eurocurrency Loans. Each Eurocurrency Loan made or maintained by a
Bank shall bear interest during each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed
on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid
principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced, continued, or
created by conversion from a Domestic Rate until maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans plus the Adjusted LIBOR applicable for
such Interest Period, payable on the last day of the Interest Period and at
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), and, if the applicable Interest
Period is longer than three months, on each day occurring every three months
after the commencement of such Interest Period. There shall not be more than ten
Eurocurrency Loans outstanding at any one time.

     (c)  Rate Determinations. The Agent shall determine each interest rate
applicable to the Loans and the other Obligations, and a reasonable
determination thereof by the Agent shall be conclusive and binding except in the
case of manifest error or willful misconduct.

     Section 1.4. Minimum Borrowing Amount for Revolving Loans. Each Borrowing
of Domestic Rate Loans shall be in an amount not less than $1,000,000 and in
integral multiples of $100,000, provided that a Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans
applied to pay a Reimbursement Obligation pursuant to Section 1.2(c) hereof
shall be in an amount equal to such Reimbursement Obligation. Each Borrowing of
Eurocurrency Loans shall be in an amount not less than $3,000,000 and, if
greater, in integral multiple of $500,000.

     Section 1.5. Manner of Borrowing, and Designating Interest Rates Applicable
to, Revolving Loans. (a) Notice to the Agent. The Borrower shall give notice to
the Agent by no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) (i) at least three Business
Days before the date on which the Borrower requests the Banks to advance a
Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans and (ii) at least one

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

Business Day before the date on which the Borrower requests the Banks to advance
a Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans. The Loans included in each Borrowing shall
bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such notice of a new
Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or
continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to
Section 1.4's minimum amount requirement for each outstanding Borrowing, a
portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of Eurocurrency Loans, on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower may
continue all or part of such Borrowing as Eurocurrency Loans for an Interest
Period or Interest Periods specified by the Borrower or convert all or part of
such Borrowing into Domestic Rate Loans and (ii) if such Borrowing is of
Domestic Rate Loans, on any Business Day, the Borrower may (subject to the
notice requirements set forth herein) convert all or part of such Borrowing into
Eurocurrency Loans for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the
Borrower. The Borrower shall give all such notices requesting the advance,
continuation, or conversion of a Borrowing to the Agent by telephone or telecopy
(which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone, shall be
promptly confirmed in writing). Notices of the continuation of a Borrowing of
Eurocurrency Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of
part or all of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans into Domestic Rate Loans or of
Domestic Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Loans must be given by no later than 11:00
a.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days before the date of the
requested continuation or conversion. All such notices concerning the advance,
continuation, or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the
requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued,
or converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted
Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Loans, the
Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrower agrees that the Agent may rely
on any such telephonic or telecopy notice given by any person it in good faith
believes is an Authorized Representative of the Borrower without the necessity
of independent investigation, and in the event any such notice by telephone
conflicts with any written confirmation, such telephonic notice shall govern if
the Agent has acted in reliance thereon.

     (b)  Notice to the Banks. Not later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the
date the Agent receives any notice from the Borrower pursuant to Section 1.5(a)
above, the Agent shall give telephonic or telecopy notice to each Bank. The
Agent shall give notice to the Borrower and each Bank by like means of the
interest rate applicable to each Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans.

     (c)  Borrower's Failure to Notify. Any outstanding Borrowing of Domestic
Rate Loans shall, subject to Section 8.2 hereof, automatically be continued for
an additional Interest Period on the last day of its then current Interest
Period unless the Borrower has notified the Agent within the period required by
Section 1.5(a) that it intends to convert such Borrowing into a Borrowing of
Eurocurrency Loans or notifies the Agent within the period required by Section
3.5(a) that it intends to prepay such Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to give
notice pursuant to Section 1.5(a) above of the continuation or conversion of any
outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans before the
last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by
Section 1.5(a) and has not notified the Agent within the period required by
Section 3.5 that it intends to prepay such Borrowing, such Borrowing shall

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans, subject to
Section 8.2 hereof.

     (d)  Disbursement of Revolving Loans. Not later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago
time) on the date of any requested advance of a new Borrowing of Eurocurrency
Loans, and not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of any requested
advance of a new Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans, subject to Section 8 hereof,
each Bank shall make available its Loan comprising part of such Borrowing in
funds immediately available at the principal office of the Agent in Chicago,
Illinois. The Agent shall make Loans available to the Borrower at the Agent's
principal office in Chicago, Illinois.

     (e)  Agent Reliance on Bank Funding. Unless the Agent shall have been
notified by a Bank before the date on which such Bank is scheduled to make
payment to the Agent of the proceeds of a Revolving Loan (which notice shall be
effective upon receipt) that such Bank does not intend to make such payment, the
Agent may assume that such Bank has made such payment when due and the Agent may
in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available
to the Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Bank and, if any
Bank has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, such Bank shall, on demand,
pay to the Agent the amount made available to the Borrower attributable to such
Bank together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending
on (but excluding) the date such Bank pays such amount to the Agent at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If such amount is not received from
such Bank by the Agent immediately upon demand, the Borrower will, on demand,
repay to the Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Bank with
interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to
the relevant Loan, but without such payment being considered a payment or
prepayment of a Loan under Section 3.6 hereof, so that the Borrower will have no
liability under such Section with respect to such payment; provided, that such
repayment by the Borrower shall not be deemed to release or otherwise limit any
claims or rights that the Borrower may have against any Bank for the failure to
fund any Loans hereunder.

Section 2.   The Swing Line.

     Section 2.1. Swing Loans. Subject to all of the terms and conditions
hereof, as part of the Revolving Credit, Harris Trust and Savings Bank
("Harris") agrees to make loans in U.S. Dollars to the Borrower under the Swing
Line ("Swing Loans") which shall not in the aggregate at any time outstanding
exceed the lesser of (i) the Swing Line Commitment or (ii) the difference
between (x) the Revolving Credit Commitments in effect at such time and (y) the
aggregate amount of all Loans and L/C Obligations outstanding at the time of
computation. The Swing Line Commitment shall be available to the Borrower and
may be availed of by the Borrower from time to time and borrowings thereunder
may be repaid and used again during the period beginning on the Effective Date
and ending on the Termination Date; provided that each Swing Loan must be repaid
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. Each Swing Loan shall
be in an amount not less than $500,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000.

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

     Section 2.2. Interest on Swing Loans. Each Swing Loan shall bear interest
at the Domestic Rate or Harris' Quoted Rate, provided that if any Swing Loan is
not paid when due (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise) such
Swing Loan shall bear interest, whether before or after judgment, until payment
in full thereof through the end of the Interest Period then applicable thereto
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of two percent (2%) plus the Applicable
Margin for Domestic Rate Loans plus the interest rate which would otherwise be
applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of two
percent (2%) plus the Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans plus the
Domestic Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on each Swing Loan shall be
due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and
interest after maturity (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise)
shall be due and payable upon demand.

     Section 2.3. Requests for Swing Loans. The Borrower shall give Harris prior
notice (which may be written or oral) no later than 3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on
the date upon which the Borrower requests that any Swing Loan be made, of the
amount and date of such Swing Loan and the Interest Period selected therefor.
Within 30 minutes after receiving such notice, Harris shall in its discretion
quote an interest rate to the Borrower at which Harris would be willing to make
such Swing Loan available to the Borrower for a given Interest Period (the rate
so quoted for a given Interest Period being herein referred to as "Harris'
Quoted Rate"). The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the interest rate quote
is given for immediate and irrevocable acceptance, and if the Borrower does not
so immediately accept Harris' Quoted Rate for the full amount requested by the
Borrower for such Swing Loan, the Harris' Quoted Rate shall be deemed
immediately withdrawn and such Swing Loan shall bear interest at the Domestic
Rate. Subject to all of the terms and conditions hereof, the proceeds of such
Swing Loan shall be made available to the Borrower on the date so requested at
the offices of Harris in Chicago, Illinois. Anything contained in the foregoing
to the contrary notwithstanding (i) the obligation of Harris to make Swing Loans
shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii)
Harris shall not be obligated to make more than one Swing Loan during any one
day.

     Section 2.4. Refunding Loans. In its sole and absolute discretion, Harris
may at any time, on behalf of the Borrower (and the Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes Harris to act on its behalf for such purpose) and with notice to the
Borrower, request each Bank to make a Revolving Loan in the form of a Domestic
Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Bank's Percentage of the amount of the
Swing Loans outstanding on the date such notice is given. Unless any of the
conditions of Section 8.2 are not fulfilled on such date, each Bank shall make
the proceeds of its requested Revolving Loan available to Harris, in immediately
available funds, at Harris' principal office in Chicago, Illinois, before 12:00
Noon (Chicago time) on the Business Day following the day such notice is given.
The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be immediately applied to repay such
outstanding Swing Loans.

     Section 2.5. Participations. If any Bank refuses or otherwise fails to
make a Revolving Loan when requested by Harris pursuant to Section 2.4 above
(because the conditions in Section 8.2 are not satisfied or otherwise), such
Bank shall, by the time and in the manner such Revolving Loan was to have been
funded to Harris, purchase from Harris an undivided participating interest in
the relevant outstanding Swing Loans in an amount equal to its Percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans that were to have been repaid with

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

such Revolving Loans, provided no purchase of a participation in a Swing Loan
bearing interest at Harris' Quoted Rate need be made until after expiration of
the Interest Period applicable thereto. Each Bank that so purchases a
participation in a Swing Loan shall thereafter be entitled to receive its
Percentage of each payment of principal received on the relevant Swing Loan and
of interest received thereon accruing from the date such Bank funded to Harris
its participation in such Loan. The several obligations of the Banks under this
Section 2.5 shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set-off, counterclaim
or defense to payment which any Bank may have or have had against the Borrower,
any other Bank or any other Person whatever. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of
Default or by any reduction or termination of the Commitments of any Bank, and
each payment made by an Bank under this Section 2.5 shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

Section 3.   General Provisions Applicable to All Loans; Reduction of
             Commitments.

     Section 3.1. Interest Periods. As provided in Section 1.5(a) hereof in the
case of Revolving Loans and in Section 2.3 in the case of Swing Loans, at the
time of each request to advance, continue, or create by conversion a Borrowing
of Loans (other than Domestic Rate Loans), the Borrower shall select an Interest
Period applicable to such Loans from among the available options. The term
"Interest Period" means the period commencing on the date a Borrowing of Loans
is advanced, continued, or created by conversion and ending: (a) in the case of
Domestic Rate Loans, on the last day of the calendar quarter in which such
Borrowing is advanced, continued, or created by conversion (or on the last day
of the following quarter if such Loan is advanced, continued or created by
conversion on the last day of a calendar quarter), (b) in the case of
Eurocurrency Loans, one, two, three, or six months thereafter and (c) in the
case of Swing Loans, on the date one to five days thereafter as mutually agreed
by Harris and the Borrower; provided, however, that:

          (a)  any Interest Period for a Borrowing of Revolving Loans consisting
of Domestic Rate Loans that otherwise would end after the Termination Date shall
end on the Termination Date;

          (b)  for any Borrowing of Revolving Loans consisting of Eurocurrency
Loans or for any Swing Loan, the Borrower may not select an Interest Period that
extends beyond the Termination Date;

          (c)  whenever the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be a
day that is not a Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, provided that, if such extension
would cause the last day of an Interest Period for a Borrowing of Eurocurrency
Loans to occur in the following calendar month, the last day of such Interest
Period shall be the immediately preceding Business Day; and

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

          (d)  for purposes of determining an Interest Period for a Borrowing of
Eurocurrency Loans, a month means a period starting on one day in a calendar
month and ending on the numerically corresponding day in the next calendar
month; provided, however, that if there is no numerically corresponding day in
the month in which such an Interest Period is to end or if such an Interest
Period begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month, then such Interest
Period shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month in which such
Interest Period is to end.

     Section 3.2. Default Rate on Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in Section 1.3 hereof, while any Event of Default
exists or after acceleration, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as
before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the
principal amount of all Loans owing by it at a rate per annum equal to:

          (a)  for any Domestic Rate Loan or any Swing Loan bearing interest
based on the Domestic Rate, the sum of two percent (2%) plus the Applicable
Margin for Domestic Rate Loans plus the Domestic Rate from time to time in
effect; and

          (b)  for any Swing Loan bearing interest at Harris' Quoted Rate or any
Eurocurrency Loan, the sum of two percent (2%) plus the rate of interest in
effect thereon at the time of such default until the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of two
percent (2%) plus the Applicable Margin for Domestic Rate Loans plus the
Domestic Rate from time to time in effect;

provided, however, that in the absence of acceleration, any adjustments pursuant
to this Section shall be made at the election of the Agent, acting at the
request or with the consent of the Required Banks, with written notice to the
Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the direction of the Required Banks
notwithstanding any provision of Section 14.13 requiring the unanimous consent
of the Banks to reduce interest rates). While any Event of Default exists or
after acceleration, interest shall be paid on demand of the Agent at the request
or with the consent of the Required Banks.

     Section 3.3. Notes. (a) Revolving Credit Notes. The Revolving Loans made to
the Borrower by a Bank shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the
Borrower issued to such Bank in the form of Exhibit B hereto. Each such
promissory note is hereinafter referred to as a "Revolving Credit Note" and
collectively such promissory notes are referred to as the "Revolving Credit
Notes."

     (b)  Swing Line Note. All Swing Loans made to the Borrower by Harris shall
be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Borrower issued to Harris in the
form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Swing Line Note"), such Swing Line Note to be
payable to the order of Harris in the principal amount of its Swing Line
Commitment and otherwise in the form of Exhibit C hereto.

     (c)  Notes Generally. Each Bank shall record on its books and records or on
a schedule to the appropriate Note the amount of each Loan advanced, continued,
or converted by it, all payments of principal and interest and the principal
balance from time to time outstanding thereon, the type of such Loan, and, for
any Fixed Rate Loan, the Interest Period and interest rate

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

applicable thereto.The record thereof, whether shown on such books and records
of a Bank or on a schedule to any Note, shall be prima facie evidence as to all
such matters; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank to record any of
the foregoing or any error in any such record shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay all Loans made to it hereunder
together with accrued interest thereon. At the request of any Bank and upon such
Bank tendering to the Borrower the Note to be replaced, the Borrower shall
furnish a new Note to such Bank to replace any outstanding Note, and at such
time the first notation appearing on a schedule on the reverse side of, or
attached to, such Note shall set forth the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
all Loans, if any, then outstanding thereon.

     Section 3.4. Maturity of Loans. Each Revolving Loan shall mature and become
due and payable by the Borrower on the Termination Date. Each Swing Loan shall
mature and become due and payable by the Borrower on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

     Section 3.5. Prepayments. The Borrower may prepay without premium or
penalty and in whole or in part (but, if in part, then: (i) if such Borrowing is
of Domestic Rate Loans, in an amount not less than $1,000,000 and in integral
multiples of $100,000, (ii) if such Borrowing is of Eurocurrency Loans, in an
amount not less than $1,000,000 and (iii) in an amount such that the minimum
amount required for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof remains
outstanding) any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans upon three Business Days' prior
notice to the Agent or, in the case of a Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans,
notice delivered to the Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the
date of prepayment, such prepayment to be made by the payment of the principal
amount to be prepaid and accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for
prepayment and, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, any compensation required by
Section 3.6 hereof. Swing Loans bearing interest at Harris' Quoted Rate may only
be paid on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Loans.
The Agent will promptly advise each Bank of any such prepayment notice it
receives from the Borrower. Any amount of Loans paid or prepaid before the
Termination Date may, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be
borrowed, repaid and borrowed again.

     Section 3.6. Funding Indemnity for Fixed Rate Loans. If any Bank shall
incur any loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss
(including loss of profit), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to
fund or maintain any Fixed Rate Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such
deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to such Bank as a result of:

          (a)  any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Fixed Rate Loan on a
date prior to the last day of its Interest Period,

          (b)  any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of
Section 8 or otherwise) by the Borrower to borrow or continue a Fixed Rate Loan,
or to convert a Domestic Rate Loan into a Fixed Rate Loan, on the date specified
in a notice given pursuant to Section 1.5(a) or 2.3 or established pursuant to
Section 1.5(c) hereof, or

          (c)  any acceleration of the maturity of a Fixed Rate Loan as a result
of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder,

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

then, upon the demand of such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
amount as will reimburse such Bank for such loss, cost or expense. If any Bank
makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the Borrower, with a
copy to the Agent, a certificate executed by an officer of such Bank setting
forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail and such
certificate shall be conclusive if reasonably determined.

     Section 3.7.  Commitment Terminations. The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time, upon five Business Days' prior written notice to
the Agent, to terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments without premium or
penalty, in whole or in part, any partial termination to be (i) in an amount not
less than $5,000,000, and (ii) allocated ratably among the Banks in proportion
to their respective Percentages, provided that (i) the Revolving Credit
Commitments may not be reduced to an amount less than the sum of the Original
Dollar Amount of all Revolving Loans, all Swing Loans and all L/C Obligations
issued and outstanding, (ii) any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments
shall automatically reduce the L/C Commitment by a proportionate amount and
(iii) any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments to an amount less than
the Swing Line Commitment shall automatically reduce the Swing Line Commitment
to such amount as well. The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from
time to time, by notice to the Agent, to terminate the L/C Commitment without
premium or penalty, in whole or in part. Any such termination of the L/C
Commitment shall not reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments unless the Borrower
elects to do so in the manner provided in the preceding sentence. The Agent
shall give prompt notice to each Bank of any such termination of Commitments.
Any termination of Commitments pursuant to this Section 3.7 may not be
reinstated.

Section 4.  Fees; Place and Application Of Payments.

     Section 4.1.  Fees. (a) Facility Fee. For the period from the Effective
Date to but not including the Termination Date, the Borrower shall pay to the
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Banks in accordance with their
Percentages, a facility fee accruing at the rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Margin for Facility Fee on the average daily amount of the Revolving
Credit Commitments whether or not in use. Such facility fee shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter in each year
(commencing September 30, 2003) and on the Termination Date, unless the
Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated in whole on an earlier date, in
which event the fee for the period to but not including the date of such
termination shall be paid in whole on the date of such termination.

     (b)  Letter of Credit Fees. On the date of issuance or extension, or
increase in the amount, of any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof,

face amount of) such Letter of Credit. Quarterly in arrears, on the last day of
each calendar quarter (commencing September 30, 2003) the Borrower shall pay to
the Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Banks in accordance with their
Percentages, a letter of credit fee at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable

Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, the up front fees due to the Banks as
heretofore agreed.

     (d)  Agent Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent the fees agreed to

of and interest on the Loans and the Reimbursement Obligations, and of all other
amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement, shall be made by the
Borrower to the Agent by no later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the due date

location in the State of Illinois as the Agent may designate to the Borrower)

Section 1.3(c) hereof. Any payments received after such time shall be deemed to
have been received by the Agent on the next Business Day. All such payments
shall be made in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds at the place of
payment. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds
relating to the payment of principal or interest on Loans or commitment fees
ratably to the Banks, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

Section 5.  Guaranties and Further Assurances.

     Section 5.1.  Guaranties. The payment and performance of the Obligations
shall at all times be guaranteed by each direct Material Wholly-Owned Domestic

Subsidiary forms or acquires any direct Material Wholly-Owned Domestic
Subsidiary after the date hereof or any Subsidiary becomes a direct Material

promptly cause such newly existing direct Material Wholly-Owned Domestic
Subsidiary to execute a Guaranty, and the Borrower shall also deliver to the

and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or such
Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity
(regardless of whether the application of such principles is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). No Loan Document, nor the performance or
observance by the Borrower or any Guarantor of any of the matters and things
herein or therein provided for, contravenes or constitutes a default under any
provision of law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the
Borrower or any Guarantor or any provision of the charter, articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or any Guarantor or any covenant,
indenture or agreement of or affecting the Borrower or any Guarantor or any of
their respective Properties, in each case where such contravention or default,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any Property of the Borrower or any Guarantor.

     Section 7.4.  Use of Proceeds; Margin Stock. The Borrower shall use the
proceeds of the Loans and other extensions of credit made available hereunder to
fund its general corporate and working capital purposes, to refinance existing
indebtedness and for such other purposes as are consistent with all applicable
laws and the terms hereof. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is engaged in
the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System), and no part of the proceeds of any Loan or any
other extension of credit hereunder will be used to purchase or carry margin
stock or used in a manner that violates any provision of Regulation U or X of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

     Section 7.5.  Financial Reports. The consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year then ended, and accompanying
notes thereto, which financial statements are accompanied by the audit report of
Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants, and the unaudited interim
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at March 31,
2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and
cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the three months then ended,
heretofore furnished to the Banks, fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at said
dates and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a consistent basis (except, in the case of such unaudited statements, for
normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as previously disclosed in writing to
the Agent, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has contingent liabilities
which are material to it other than as indicated on such financial statements
or, with respect to future periods, on the financial statements furnished
pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof.

     Section 7.6.  No Material Adverse Change. Since March 31, 2003, except as
previously disclosed in writing to the Agent, there has been no change in the
condition (financial or otherwise) or business prospects of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 7.7.  Full Disclosure. The written statements and information
furnished to the Banks in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and the commitments by the Banks to provide all or part
of the financing contemplated hereby do not contain any untrue statements of a
material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the material statements
contained herein or therein not misleading, the Banks acknowledging that as to
any projections furnished to the Banks, the Borrower only represents that the
same were prepared on the basis of information and estimates the Borrower
believed to be reasonable.

     Section 7.8.  Good Title. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries each have good
and defensible title to their assets as reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries furnished to the
Banks, subject to no Liens other than such thereof as are permitted by Section
9.9 hereof.

     Section 7.9.  Litigation and Other Controversies. Except as otherwise
disclosed in the Borrower's financial statements heretofore delivered to the
Agent, there is no litigation or governmental proceeding or labor controversy
pending, nor to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened, against the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     Section 7.10. Taxes. All federal, state and other material tax returns
required to be filed by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in any jurisdiction
have, in fact, been filed, and all taxes, assessments, fees and other
governmental charges upon the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or upon any of their
respective Properties, income or franchises, which are shown to be due and
payable in such returns, have been paid, except for any taxes, assessments, fees
or charges being contested in good faith by appropriate proceeding and for which
adequate reserves have been provided. Except as previously disclosed in writing
to the Agent, the Borrower does not know of any proposed additional tax
assessment against it or its Subsidiaries for which adequate provision in
accordance with GAAP has not been made on its accounts. Adequate provisions in
accordance with GAAP for taxes on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
have been made for all open years, and for its current fiscal period.

     Section 7.11. Approvals. No authorization, consent, license, or exemption
from, or filing or registration with, any court or governmental department,
agency or instrumentality, nor any approval or consent of the stockholders of
the Borrower or any other Person, is or will be

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

necessary to the valid execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     Section 7.12. Affiliate Transactions. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is a party to any contracts or agreements with any of its Affiliates
(other than transactions between the Borrower and a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary or
between Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries) on terms and conditions which are less
favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary than would be usual and customary
in similar contracts or agreements between Persons not affiliated with each
other.

     Section 7.13. Investment Company; Public Utility Holding Company. Neither
the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a "public utility holding company" within
the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

     Section 7.14. ERISA. In respect of each Plan, the Borrower and each other
member of its Controlled Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum
funding standards of and is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA
and the Code to the extent applicable to it and has not incurred any material
liability to the PBGC or a Plan under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability
to the PBGC for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary has any material contingent liabilities with respect to any
post-retirement benefits under a Welfare Plan, other than liability for
continuation coverage described in article 6 of Title I of ERISA.

     Section 7.15. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with the requirements of all federal, state and local laws, rules
and regulations applicable to or pertaining to their Properties or business
operations (including, without limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and laws and
regulations establishing quality criteria and standards for air, water, land and
toxic or hazardous wastes and substances), non-compliance with which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary has received notice to the effect that its operations are not
in compliance with any of the requirements of applicable federal, state or local
environmental, health and safety statutes and regulations or are the subject of
any governmental investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed
to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the
environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 7.16. Other Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is
in default under the terms of any covenant, indenture or agreement of or
affecting the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any of their Properties, which default
if uncured could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 7.17. Labor Controversies. There are no labor controversies pending
or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                      -26-

delivery of the Loan Documents and the extensions of credit under this
Agreement: (a) neither the Borrower nor any Guarantor will (i) be "insolvent,"
within the meaning of such term as used in Section 101 of the "Bankruptcy Code",
or Section 2 of either the "UFTA" or the "UFCA", or as defined or used in any
"Other Applicable Law" (as those terms are defined below), or (ii) be unable to
pay its debts generally as such debts become due within the meaning of Section
548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 6 of the UFCA, or

transaction, whether current or contemplated, within the meaning of Section 548
of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA; and (b)
the obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors under the Loan Documents and
with respect to the Loans and Letters of Credit will not be rendered avoidable
under any Other Applicable Law. For purposes of this Section, "Bankruptcy Code"
means Title 11 of the United States Code, "UFTA" means the Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act, "UFCA" means the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, and "Other
Applicable Law" means any other applicable law pertaining to fraudulent
transfers or obligations voidable by creditors, in each case as such law may be
amended from time to time.

     Section 7.19. Not a Tax Shelter Transaction. The Borrower does not intend
to treat the Loans and related transactions as being a "reportable transaction"
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4). In the event the
Borrower determines to take any action inconsistent with such intention, it will
promptly notify the Agent thereof.

     Section 7.20. No Default. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

     subsections (a) through (g) provided such Liens do not at any time secure
     obligations exceeding 10% of Net Worth as then determined and computed.

     Section 9.10. Acquisitions. The Borrower shall not, nor shall it permit
any Subsidiary to, acquire all or any substantial part of the assets or business
of any other Person or division thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply to nor operate to prevent acquisitions of all or substantially
all of the assets or business of any other Person or division thereof, or all or
any part of the Voting Stock of or other equity interest in any Person
(including as such an acquisition, any action to participate as a joint venturer
in any joint venture or as a partner in any partnership), in each case if and so
long as (i) no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist after giving
effect to such acquisition, (ii) after giving effect to such acquisition, the
Borrower would have unused Revolving Credit Commitments in excess of $50,000,000
and, in the case of any acquisition in which the aggregate consideration is
greater than $50,000,000, the Borrower shall have furnished to the Agent a
certificate to that effect in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Agent, (iii) the Board of Directors or other governing body of such Person whose
Property or Voting Stock or other equity interest is being so acquired has not
opposed the terms of such acquisition and (iv) such acquisition involves a line
of business which is complementary to the lines of business in which the
Borrower or the Subsidiary, as the case may be, making such acquisition is
engaged on the Effective Date.

     Section 9.11. Mergers, Consolidations and Sales. The Borrower shall not be
a party to any merger or consolidation unless the Borrower is the surviving
entity and no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist after giving
effect to such merger or consolidation. The Borrower shall not, nor shall it
permit any Subsidiary to, sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or
any part of its Property, including any disposition of Property as part of a
sale and leaseback transaction, or in any event sell or discount (with or
without recourse) any of its notes or accounts receivable; provided, however,
that so long as no Default or Event of Default exists this Section shall not
apply to nor operate to prevent:

          (a)  the sale or lease of inventory in the ordinary course of
     business;

          (b)  the sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of Property of the
     Borrower and its Subsidiaries to one another;

                                      -33-

     Borrower being the surviving entity) or another existing or newly-formed
     Subsidiary;

          (d)  the dissolution of any Subsidiary pursuant to a plan of
     dissolution requiring the conveyance or distribution of all or
     substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary to the Borrower or to
     another existing or newly-formed Subsidiary;

          (e)  the dissolution, sale or transfer of any Non-Guarantor
     Subsidiary;

          (f)  the sale of delinquent notes or accounts receivable in the
     ordinary course of business for purposes of collection only (and not for
     the purpose of any bulk sale or securitization transaction);

          (g)  the sale, transfer or other disposition of any tangible personal
     property that, in the reasonable business judgment of the Borrower or its
     Subsidiary, has become obsolete or worn out, and which is disposed of in
     the ordinary course of business; and

          (h)  any other sale, transfer, lease or disposition of Property of the
     Borrower or any Subsidiary not described in the foregoing clauses (a)
     through (g) (including any disposition of Property as part of a sale and
     leaseback transaction) aggregating for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
     not more than $200,000,000 during the term of this Agreement.

     Section 9.12. ERISA. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary
to, promptly pay and discharge all obligations and liabilities arising under
ERISA of a character which if unpaid or unperformed could reasonably be expected
to result in the imposition of a Lien against any of its Properties. The
Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, promptly notify the Agent
and each Bank of (i) the occurrence of any reportable event (as defined in
ERISA) with respect to a Plan (other than a reportable event with respect to
which the 30 day notice requirement is waived), (ii) receipt of any notice from
the PBGC of its intention to seek termination of any Plan or appointment of a
trustee therefor, (iii) its intention to terminate or withdraw from any Plan,
and (iv) the occurrence of any event with respect to any Plan which would result
in the incurrence by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any material liability,
fine or penalty, or any material increase in the contingent liability of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary with respect to any post-retirement Welfare Plan
benefit.

     Section 9.13. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower shall, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to, comply in all respects with the requirements of all federal,
state and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances and orders applicable to or
pertaining to their Properties or business operations, non-compliance with which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 9.14. Burdensome Contracts with Affiliates. The Borrower shall
not, nor shall it permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any contract, agreement
or business arrangement with any of its Affiliates (other than transactions
between the Borrower and a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary or between Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries) on terms and conditions which are less favorable to the

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

Borrower or such Subsidiary than would be usual and customary in similar
contracts, agreements or business arrangements between Persons not affiliated
with each other.

     Section 9.15. No Changes in Fiscal Year. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary shall change its fiscal year from its present basis without the prior
written consent of the Required Banks, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.

     Section 9.16. Change in the Nature of Business. The Borrower shall not,
and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, engage in any business or activity if as
a result the general nature of the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole would be changed in any material respect from the general
nature of the business engaged in by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the
date of this Agreement.

     Section 9.17. Assets and EBITDA of Guarantors. At no time during the term
of this Agreement shall the aggregate of the assets directly owned by the
Borrower and directly or indirectly owned by each Guarantor aggregate less than
$1,000,000,000, measured, in each case, as of the end of the most recently
completed fiscal quarter. At no time during the term of this Agreement shall the
aggregate EBITDA of the Borrower and each Guarantor comprise less than (a) 85%
of the consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or (b)
$150,000,000, in each case, such EBITDA measured as of the end of the most
recent fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarter period ending on such date.
For purposes of computing the Borrower's compliance with this Section 9.17 for
the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003, the Borrower shall be permitted to add
back to EBITDA the $28,900,000 non-cash write-off of investments taken by the
Borrower in its third fiscal quarter of 2002.

Section 10. Events of Default and Remedies.

     Section 10.1. Events of Default. Any one or more of the following shall
constitute an Event of Default:

          (a)  default (i) in the payment when due of the principal amount of
     any Loan or (ii) for a period of three Business Days in the payment when
     due of interest or fees or any part of any other Obligation payable by the
     Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document; or

          (e)  default in the observance or performance of any other provision
     hereof or of any other Loan Document which is not remedied within 30 days
     after the earlier of (i) the date on which such failure shall first become
     known to any officer of the Borrower or (ii) written notice thereof is
     given to the Borrower by the Agent or any Bank; or

          (f)  any representation or warranty made by the Borrower herein or in
     any other Loan Document, or in any statement or certificate furnished by it
     pursuant hereto or thereto, or in connection with any Loan or other
     extension of credit made hereunder, proves untrue in any material respect
     as of the date of the issuance or making thereof; or

          (g)  default shall occur under any evidence of Indebtedness for
     Borrowed Money issued, assumed or guaranteed by the Borrower or any
     Subsidiary aggregating in excess of $10,000,000, or under any indenture,
     agreement or other instrument under which the same may be issued, and such
     default shall continue for a period of time sufficient to permit the
     acceleration of the maturity of any such Indebtedness for Borrowed Money
     (whether or not such maturity is in fact accelerated), or any such
     Indebtedness for Borrowed Money shall not be paid when due (whether by
     lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise); or

          (h)  any judgment or judgments, writ or writs, or warrant or warrants
     of attachment, or any similar process or processes in an aggregate amount
     in excess of $10,000,000 shall be entered or filed against the Borrower or
     any Subsidiary or against any of their Property which remains unvacated,
     unbonded, unstayed or unsatisfied for a period of 30 days; or

          (i)  the Borrower or any member of its Controlled Group shall fail to
     pay when due an amount or amounts aggregating in excess of $2,000,000 which
     it shall have become liable to pay to the PBGC or to a Plan under Title IV
     of ERISA; or notice of intent to terminate a Plan or Plans having aggregate
     Unfunded Vested Liabilities in excess of $10,000,000 (or in the case of a
     Multiemployer Plan, a Plan with respect to which the Borrower's
     responsibility for Unfunded Vested Liabilities is in excess of $10,000,000)
     (collectively, a "Material Plan") shall be filed under Title IV of ERISA by
     the Borrower or any other member of its Controlled Group, any plan
     administrator or any combination of the foregoing; or the PBGC shall
     institute proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to terminate or to cause a
     trustee to be appointed to administer any Material Plan or a proceeding
     shall be instituted by a fiduciary of any Material Plan against the
     Borrower or any member of its Controlled Group to enforce Section 515 or
     4219(c)(5) of ERISA and such proceeding shall not have been dismissed
     within 30 days thereafter; or a condition shall exist by reason of which
     the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree adjudicating that any
     Material Plan must be terminated; or

          (j)  the occurrence of a Change of Control; or

          (k)  the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall (i) have entered
     involuntarily against it an order for relief under the United States
     Bankruptcy Code, as amended, (ii) not pay, or admit in writing its
     inability to pay, its debts generally as they

                                      -36-

     seeking to have entered against it an order for relief under the United
     States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, to adjudicate it insolvent, or seeking
     dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, arrangement,
     adjustment or composition of it or its debts under any law relating to
     bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors or fail to
     file an answer or other pleading denying the material allegations of any
     such proceeding filed against it, (vi) take any corporate action in
     furtherance of any matter described in parts (ii) through (v) above, or
     (vii) fail to contest in good faith any appointment or proceeding described
     in Section 10.1(l) hereof; or

          (l)  a custodian, receiver, trustee, examiner, liquidator or similar
     official shall be appointed for the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary or
     any substantial part of any of its Property, or a proceeding described in
     Section 10.1(k)(v) shall be instituted against the Borrower or any Material
     Subsidiary, and such appointment continues undischarged or such proceeding
     continues undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 days.

     Section 10.2. Non-Bankruptcy Defaults. When any Event of Default other
than those described in subsections (k) or (l) of Section 10.1 hereof has
occurred and is continuing, the Agent shall, if so directed by the Required
Banks, by written notice to the Borrower: (a) terminate the remaining
Commitments and all other obligations of the Banks hereunder on the date stated
in such notice (which may be the date thereof); (b) declare the principal of and
the accrued interest on all outstanding Notes to be forthwith due and payable
and thereupon all outstanding Notes, including both principal and interest
thereon, shall be and become immediately due and payable together with all other
amounts payable under the Loan Documents without further demand, presentment,
protest or notice of any kind; and (c) demand that the Borrower immediately pay
to the Agent, subject to Section 10.4, the full amount then available for
drawing under each or any Letter of Credit, and the Borrower agrees to
immediately make such payment and acknowledges and agrees that the Banks would
not have an adequate remedy at law for failure by the Borrower to honor any such
demand and that the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, shall have the right to
require the Borrower to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any
drawings or other demands for payment have been made under any Letter of Credit.

     Section 10.3. Bankruptcy Defaults. When any Event of Default described in
subsections (k) or (l) of Section 10.1 hereof has occurred and is continuing,
then all outstanding Notes shall immediately become due and payable together
with all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, the obligation of the Banks to extend
further credit pursuant to any of the terms hereof shall immediately terminate
and the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent, subject to Section 10.4,
the full amount then available for drawing under all outstanding Letters of
Credit, the Borrower acknowledging that the Banks would not have an adequate
remedy at law for failure by the Borrower to honor any such demand and that the
Banks, and the Agent on their behalf, shall have the right to require the
Borrower to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any draws or
other demands for payment have been made under any of the Letters of Credit.

                                      -37-

<PAGE>

     Section 10.4.  Collateral for Undrawn Letters of Credit. (a) If the payment
or prepayment of the amount available for drawing under any or all outstanding
Letters of Credit is required under Section 1.2(b), Section 10.2 or Section 10.3
above, the Borrower shall forthwith pay the amount required to be so prepaid, to
be held by the Agent as provided in subsection (b) below.

     (b)  All amounts prepaid pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be held by
the Agent in a separate collateral account (such account, and the credit
balances, properties and any investments from time to time held therein, and any
substitutions for such account, any certificate of deposit or other instrument
evidencing any of the foregoing and all proceeds of and earnings on any of the
foregoing being collectively called the "Account") as security for, and for
application by the Agent (to the extent available) to, the reimbursement of any
payment under any Letter of Credit then or thereafter made by the Agent. The
Account shall be held in the name of and subject to the exclusive dominion and
control of the Agent for the benefit of the Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Banks.
If and when requested by the Borrower, the Agent shall invest funds held in the
Account from time to time in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal
of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of
America with a remaining maturity of one year or less, provided that the Agent
is irrevocably authorized to sell investments held in the Account when and as
required to make payments out of the Account for application to amounts due and
owing from the Borrower to the Agent, the L/C Issuer or Banks; provided,
however, that if (i) the Borrower shall have made payment of all such
obligations referred to in subsection (a) above and (ii) no Letters of Credit
remain outstanding hereunder, then the Agent shall repay to the Borrower any
remaining amounts held in the Account.

     Section 10.5. Notice of Default. The Agent shall give notice to the
Borrower under Section 10.1(c) hereof promptly upon being requested to do so by
any Bank and shall thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.

     Section 10.6. Expenses. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the
account of the Agent and each Bank, and any other holder of any Note outstanding
hereunder, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid by the Agent and such
Bank or any such holder, including attorneys' fees and court costs, in
connection with any Default or Event of Default by the Borrower hereunder or in
connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents.

Section 11. Change in Circumstances.

     Section 11.1. Change of Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement or any Note, if at any time after the date hereof any Bank shall
determine in good faith that any change in applicable laws, treaties or
regulations or in the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for such Bank to
make or continue to maintain Eurocurrency Loans, such Bank shall promptly give
notice thereof to the Agent (which shall in turn promptly notify the Borrower
and the other Banks) and such Bank's obligations to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Loans under this Agreement shall terminate until it is no longer
unlawful for such Bank to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans. The Borrower
shall prepay on the last day of the Interest Period for any such affected
Eurocurrency Loan, or within such earlier period as required by law upon demand
from the affected Bank, the outstanding principal amount of any such affected
Eurocurrency Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other
amounts payable to the affected

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

Bank with respect thereto; provided, however, subject to all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then elect to borrow the
principal amount of the affected Eurocurrency Loans from such Bank by means of
Domestic Rate Loans from such Bank, which Domestic Rate Loans shall not be made
ratably by the Banks but only from such affected Bank.

     Section 11.2. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or
Inadequacy of, Adjusted LIBOR. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest
Period for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans:

          (a)  the Agent determines that deposits in U.S. Dollars (in the
     applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the eurocurrency
     interbank market for such Interest Period, or that by reason of
     circumstances affecting the interbank eurocurrency market adequate and
     reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted
     LIBOR, or

          (b)  the Required Banks determine and so advise the Agent that
     Adjusted LIBOR as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly
     reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Eurocurrency Loans or Loan
     for such Interest Period,

then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to
make Eurocurrency Loans in the currency so affected shall be suspended.

     Section 11.3. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If, after the date
hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its
Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force
of law but, if not having the force of law, compliance with which is customary
in the relevant jurisdiction) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency issued after the date hereof:

          (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty
     or other charge with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes, its
     Letters of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement
     Obligations owed to it or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, issue
     Letters of Credit, or to participate therein, or shall change the basis of
     taxation of payments to any Bank (or its Lending Office) of the principal
     of or interest on its Eurocurrency Loans, Letters of Credit, or
     participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement in
     respect of its Eurocurrency Loans, Letters of Credit, or participations
     therein, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it, or its obligation to
     make Eurocurrency Loans, issue a Letter of Credit, or acquire
     participations therein (except for changes in the rate of tax on the
     overall net income or profits of such Bank or its Lending Office imposed by
     the jurisdiction in which such Bank or its lending office is incorporated,
     or in which such Bank's principal executive office or Lending Office is
     located); or

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

          (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such
     requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
     System, but excluding with respect to any Eurocurrency Loans any such
     requirement included in an applicable Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage)
     against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
     by, any Bank (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its
     Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting
     its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes, its Letters of Credit, or its
     participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligation owed to it, or
     its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, to issue a Letter of Credit, or
     to participate therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan, issuing or
maintaining a Letter of Credit, or participating therein, or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Office)
under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an amount
deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such
Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such
Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such
increased cost or reduction. In the event any law, rule, regulation or
interpretation described above is revoked, declared invalid or inapplicable or
is otherwise rescinded, and as a result thereof a Bank is determined to be
entitled to a refund from the applicable authority for any amount or amounts
which were paid or reimbursed by the Borrower to such Bank hereunder, such Bank
shall refund such amount or amounts to the Borrower without interest.

     (b)  If any Bank or the Agent shall have determined that the adoption,
after the date hereof, of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding
capital adequacy, or any change therein (including, without limitation, any
revision in the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225,
Appendix A) or of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3,
Appendix A), or in any other applicable capital rules heretofore adopted and
issued by any governmental authority), or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof after the date hereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with
any request or directive issued after the date hereof regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law but, if not having the force of law,
compliance with which is customary in the applicable jurisdiction) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital, or on the capital of any
corporation controlling such Bank, as a consequence of its obligations hereunder
to a level below that which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material,
then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to
the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

     (c)  Each Bank that determines to seek compensation under this Section 11.3
shall notify the Borrower and the Agent of the circumstances that entitle the
Bank to such

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

compensation pursuant to this Section 11.3 and will designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation
under this Section 11.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be
paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive if reasonably determined. The Borrower
shall not be obligated to reimburse, compensate or indemnify any Bank with
respect to a claim or any portion thereof to the extent such claim or portion
thereof arose more than 120 days prior to the notice of such claim delivered
pursuant to this Section 11.3(c).

     Section 11.4. Lending Offices. Each Bank may, at its option, elect to make
its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the
appropriate signature page hereof (each a "Lending Office") for each type of
Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates
as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the
Borrower and the Agent.

     Section 11.5. Discretion of Bank as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each Bank shall be entitled to fund and
maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit,
it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all
determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded and
maintained each Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of deposits of U.S.
Dollars in the eurocurrency interbank market having a maturity corresponding to
such Loan's Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to Adjusted LIBOR
for such Interest Period.

     Section 11.6. Replacement of Banks. If the Borrower is required pursuant
to Section 11.3 or Section 14.1 hereof to make any additional payment to any
Bank or if any Bank's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Domestic
Rate Loans into, Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 11.1
or Section 11.2 hereof, or if any Bank does not timely agree or consent, in
writing, to any amendment or consent hereto or waiver of any provision hereof
which is timely agreed or consented to by the Required Banks (any such Bank
being hereinafter referred to as a "Replaced Bank"), then in such case, the
Borrower may, upon at least five Business Days' notice to the Agent and to such
Replaced Bank, designate a replacement lender (a "Replacement Bank") acceptable
to the Agent in its reasonable discretion, to which such Replaced Bank shall,
subject to its receipt (unless a later date for the remittance thereof shall be
agreed upon by the Borrower and the Replaced Bank) of all amounts owed to such
Replaced Bank under Section 11.3 or Section 14.1, assign all (but not less than
all) of its rights, obligations, Loans and Commitments hereunder; provided, that
all amounts (including amounts owed pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof) owed by the
Borrower to such Replaced Bank hereunder (except liabilities which by the terms
hereof survive the payment in full of the Loans and termination of this
Agreement) shall be paid in full as of the date of such assignment.

Section 12. The Agent.

     Section 12.1. Appointment and Authorization of Agent. Each Bank hereby
appoints Harris Trust and Savings Bank as the Agent under the Loan Documents and
hereby authorizes the Agent to take such action as the Agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers under the

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms thereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

     Section 12.2. Agent and its Affiliates. The Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other
Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not
the Agent, and the Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any
Affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not the Agent under the Loan Documents.
The term "Bank" as used herein and in all other Loan Documents, unless the
context otherwise clearly requires, includes the Agent in its individual
capacity as a Bank. References in Section 1 hereof to the Agent's Loans, or to
the amount owing to the Agent for which an interest rate is being determined,
refer to the Agent in its individual capacity as a Bank.

     Section 12.3. Action by Agent. If the Agent receives from the Borrower a
written notice of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 9.4(f) hereof, the
Agent shall promptly give each of the Banks written notice thereof. The Banks
expressly agree that the Agent is not acting as a fiduciary of the Banks in
respect of the Loan Documents, the Borrower or otherwise, and nothing herein or
in any of the other Loan Documents shall result in any duties or obligations on
the Agent or any of the Banks except as expressly set forth herein. The
obligations of the Agent under the Loan Documents are only those expressly set
forth therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall
not be required to take any action hereunder with respect to any Default or
Event of Default, except as expressly provided in Sections 10.2 and 10.5 hereof.
In no event, however, shall the Agent be required to take any action in
violation of applicable law or of any provision of any Loan Document, and the
Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act
hereunder or under any other Loan Document unless it shall be first indemnified
to its reasonable satisfaction by the Banks against any and all costs, expense,
and liability which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action. The Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or
Event of Default exists unless notified to the contrary by a Bank or the
Borrower. In all cases in which this Agreement and the other Loan Documents do
not require the Agent to take certain actions, the Agent shall be fully
justified in using its discretion in failing to take or in taking any action
hereunder and thereunder.

     Section 12.4. Consultation with Experts. The Agent may consult with legal
counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

     Section 12.5. Liability of Agent; Credit Decision. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Loan Documents (i) with
the consent or at the request of the Required Banks or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any Credit Event; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants
or agreements of the Borrower contained herein or in any

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

other Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in
Section 8 hereof, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Agent;
or (iv) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, perfection,
value, worth or collectibility hereof or of any other Loan Document or of any
other documents or writing furnished in connection with any Loan Document; and
the Agent makes no representation of any kind or character with respect to any
such matter mentioned in this sentence. The Agent may execute any of its duties
under any of the Loan Documents by or through employees, agents, and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Banks, the Borrower, or any
other Person for the default or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected with reasonable care. The Agent shall not incur any
liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, other
document or statement (whether written or oral) believed by it to be genuine or
to be sent by the proper party or parties. In particular and without limiting
any of the foregoing, the Agent shall have no responsibility for confirming the
accuracy of any Compliance Certificate or other document or instrument received
by it under the Loan Documents. The Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with the
Agent signed by such payee in form satisfactory to the Agent. Each Bank
acknowledges that it has independently and without reliance on the Agent or any
other Bank, and based upon such information, investigations and inquiries as it
deems appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to
the Borrower in the manner set forth in the Loan Documents. It shall be the
responsibility of each Bank to keep itself informed as to the creditworthiness
of the Borrower and the Agent shall have no liability to any Bank with respect
thereto.

     Section 12.6. Indemnity. The Banks shall ratably, in accordance with their
respective Percentages, indemnify and hold the Agent, and its directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any
liabilities, losses, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by it under any Loan
Document or in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, regardless
of when asserted or arising, except to the extent they are promptly reimbursed
for the same by the Borrower and except to the extent that any event giving rise
to a claim was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party
seeking to be indemnified. The obligations of the Banks under this Section 12.6
shall survive termination of this Agreement.

     Section 12.7. Resignation of Agent and Successor Agent. The Agent may
resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the
Borrower. Upon any such notice of resignation of the Agent, the Required Banks
shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent with the consent of the
Borrower. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may,
on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be any Bank
hereunder or any commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States
of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of
at least $200,000,000. The retiring Agent shall continue as Agent hereunder
until a successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent. Upon the acceptance
of its appointment as the Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring or
removed Agent under the Loan Documents, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations thereunder. After any retiring
Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

of this Section 12 and all protective provisions of the other Loan Documents
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent.

     Section 12.8. L/C Issuer. The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Banks
with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated
therewith. The L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i)
provided to the Agent in this Section 12 with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued
by it or proposed to be issued by it and the Applications pertaining to such
Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Agent", as used in this Section 12,
included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as
additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to such L/C Issuer.

     Section 12.9. Syndication Agent . The Bank designated as Syndication Agent
shall have no duties or responsibilities for the administration of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The Agent shall have the continuing
right, for purposes hereof, at any time and from time to time to designate one
or more of the Banks (and/or its or their Affiliates) as "syndication agents,"
"documentation agents," "arrangers," or other designations for purposes hereto,
but such designation shall have no substantive effect, and such Banks and their
Affiliates shall have no additional powers, duties or responsibilities as a
result thereof.

Section 13.  The Guaranties.

     Section 13.1. The Guaranties. To induce the Banks to provide the credits
described herein and in consideration of benefits expected to accrue to the
Borrower by reason of the Commitments and for other good and valuable
consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees jointly and severally to the Agent
and the Banks, the due and punctual payment of all present and future
Obligations, including, but not limited to, the due and punctual payment of
principal of and interest on the Notes, the Reimbursement Obligations, and the
due and punctual payment of all other Obligations now or hereafter owed by the
Borrower under the Loan Documents as and when the same shall become due and
payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, according to
the terms hereof and thereof. In case of failure by the Borrower punctually to
pay any Obligations guaranteed hereby, each Guarantor hereby unconditionally
agrees to make such payment or to cause such payment to be made punctually as
and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration, or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by the Borrower.

     Section 13.2. Guarantee Unconditional. The obligations of each Guarantor
under this Section 13 shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged, or otherwise
affected by:

          (a)  any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver, or
     release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower or of any other
     guarantor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or by operation
     of law or otherwise;

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

          (b)  any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement
     or any other Loan Document;

          (c)  any change in the corporate existence, structure, or ownership
     of, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar
     proceeding affecting, the Borrower, any other guarantor, or any of their
     respective assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation
     of the Borrower or of any other guarantor contained in any Loan Document;

          (d)  the existence of any claim, set-off, or other rights which the
     Borrower or any other guarantor may have at any time against the Agent, any
     Bank, or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection herewith;

          (e)  any failure to assert, or any assertion of, any claim or demand
     or any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights or remedies against
     the Borrower, any other guarantor, or any other Person or Property;

          (f)  any application of any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever
     realized to any obligation of the Borrower, regardless of what obligations
     of the Borrower remain unpaid;

          (g)  any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the
     Borrower or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement or of any
     other Loan Document or any provision of applicable law or regulation
     purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower or any other guarantor
     of the principal of or interest on any Note or any Reimbursement Obligation
     or any other amount payable under the Loan Documents; or

          (h)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the
     Agent, any Bank, or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever
     that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or
     equitable discharge of the obligations of any Guarantor under this Section
     13.

     Section 13.3. Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in
Certain Circumstances. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Section 13 shall
remain in full force and effect until the Commitments are terminated, all
Letters of Credit have expired, and the principal of and interest on the Notes
and all other amounts payable by the Borrower and the Guarantors under this
Agreement and all other Loan Documents shall have been paid in full. If at any
time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any
Reimbursement Obligation or any other amount payable by the Borrower or any
Guarantor under the Loan Documents is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or
returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower or
of any guarantor, or otherwise, each Guarantor's obligations under this Section
13 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such
payment had become due but had not been made at such time.

     Section 13.4. Subrogation. Each Guarantor agrees it will not exercise any
rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation by any payment made hereunder,
or otherwise, until all the

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

Obligations shall have been paid in full subsequent to the termination of all
the Commitments and expiration of all Letters of Credit. If any amount shall be
paid to a Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to
the later of (x) the payment in full of the Obligations and all other amounts
payable by the Borrower hereunder and the other Loan Documents and (y) the
termination of the Commitments and expiration of all Letters of Credit, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks and
shall forthwith be paid to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks or be credited
and applied upon the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

     Section 13.5. Waivers. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance
hereof, presentment, demand, protest, and any notice not provided for herein, as
well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by the Agent, any
Bank, or any other Person against the Borrower, another guarantor, or any other
Person.

     Section 13.6. Limit on Recovery. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, the right of recovery against each Guarantor under this Section 13 shall
not exceed $1.00 less than the lowest amount which would render such Guarantor's
obligations under this Section 13 void or voidable under applicable law,
including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance law.

     Section 13.7. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for
payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall nonetheless be payable by the
Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Agent made at the request of the
Required Banks.

     Section 13.8. Benefit to Guarantors. All of the Guarantors are engaged in
related businesses and integrated to such an extent that the financial strength
and flexibility of each Guarantor has a direct impact on the success of each
other Guarantor. Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect
benefit from the extension of credit hereunder.

     Section 13.9. Guarantor Covenants. Each Guarantor shall take such action
as the Borrower is required by this Agreement to cause such Guarantor to take,
and shall refrain from taking such action as the Borrower is required by this
Agreement to prohibit such Guarantor from taking.

Section 14.  Miscellaneous.

     Section 14.1. Withholding Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Withholding. Except
as otherwise required by law and subject to Section 14.1(b) hereof, each payment
by the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made
without withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes (other than
overall net income taxes on the recipient) imposed by or within the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is domiciled, any jurisdiction from which the Borrower
makes any payment, or (in each case) any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein. If any such withholding is so required, the
Borrower shall make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate
governmental authority before penalties

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and forthwith pay such additional
amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by
each Bank and the Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on
such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Bank or the Agent (as
the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. If the
Agent or any Bank pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or
interest, the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent or that Bank for that payment
on demand in the currency in which such payment was made. If the Borrower pays
any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts
evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to the Bank or Agent on
whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to the Agent if not the
recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment.

     (b)  U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions. Each Bank that is not a United States
person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit
to the Borrower and the Agent on or before the earlier of the initial Credit
Event and 30 days after the date hereof, two duly completed and signed copies of
either Form W-8 BEN (or substantially similar substitute forms) or Form W-8ECI
(or substantially similar substitute forms) of the United States Internal
Revenue Service certifying such Bank's entitlement to a complete exemption from
United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this
Agreement. Thereafter and from time to time, each Bank shall submit to the
Borrower and the Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one
or the other of such Forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (i)
requested by the Borrower in a written notice, directly or through the Agent, to
such Bank and (ii) required under then-current United States law or regulations
to avoid or reduce United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all
amounts to be received by such Bank, including fees, pursuant to the Loan
Documents or the Loans. All forms or amendments described in the preceding
sentence shall certify that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment
with respect to it and such Bank advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is
not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax. For any period during which a Bank that is not a
United States Person has failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form
pursuant to this Section 14.1(b) (unless such failure is due to a change in
treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which
a form originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not be entitled
to indemnification under this Section 14.1 with respect to taxes imposed by the
United States.

     (c)  Inability of Bank to Submit Forms. If any Bank determines, as a result
of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official
application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to the
Borrower or Agent any form or certificate that such Bank is obligated to submit
pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 14.1 or that such Bank is required to
withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such
form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Bank shall
promptly notify the Borrower and Agent of such fact and the Bank shall to that
extent not be obligated to provide

                                      -47-

<PAGE>

any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any
affected form or certificate, as applicable.

     Section 14.2. No Waiver of Rights. No delay or failure on the part of the
Agent or any Bank or on the part of any holder or holders of any of the
Obligations in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of the Agent, the
Banks and any holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and
not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have.

     Section 14.3. Non-Business Day. If any payment hereunder becomes due and
payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall
be due and payable. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day
which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to
accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued
amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of
interest.

     Section 14.4. Documentary Taxes. The Borrower agrees that it will pay any
documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of any Loan Document,
including interest and penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed,
irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or not any credit is
then in use or available hereunder.

     Section 14.5. Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made herein or in certificates given pursuant hereto shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and
shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as of which
they were made as long as any credit is in use or available hereunder.

     Section 14.6. Survival of Indemnities. All indemnities and all other
provisions relative to reimbursement to the Banks of amounts sufficient to
protect the yield of the Banks with respect to the Loans, including, but not
limited to, Section 3.6, Section 11.3 and Section 14.15 hereof, shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment
of the Loans and all other Obligations.

     Section 14.7. Sharing of Set-Off. Each Bank agrees with each other Bank
which is a party hereto that if such Bank shall receive and retain any payment,
whether by set-off or application of deposit balances or otherwise ("Set-off"),
on any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its ratable share
of payments on all such obligations then outstanding to the Banks, then such
Bank shall purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, ratably from
each of the other Banks such amount of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations,
or participations therein, held by each such other Banks (or interest therein)
as shall be necessary to cause such Bank to share such excess payment ratably
with all the other Banks; provided, however, that if any such purchase is made
by any Bank, and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered
from such purchasing Bank, the related purchases from the other Banks shall be

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such
excess payment so recovered, but without interest. For purposes of this Section
14.7, amounts owed to or recovered by, the Agent in connection with
Reimbursement Obligations in which Banks have been required to fund their
participation shall be treated as amounts owed to or recovered by the Agent as a
Bank hereunder.

     Section 14.8. Notices. Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices
under the Loan Documents shall be in writing (including telecopy or other
electronic communication) and shall be given to a party hereunder at its address
or telecopier number set forth below or such other address or telecopier number
as such party may hereafter specify by notice to the Agent and the Borrower,
given by courier, or by other telecommunication device capable of creating a
written record of such notice and its receipt. Notices under the Loan Documents
to the Banks and the Agent shall be addressed to their respective addresses,
telecopier or telephone numbers set forth on the signature pages hereof, and to
the Borrower shall be addressed as follows:

     Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if
given by telecopier, when such telecopy is transmitted to the telecopier number
specified in this Section 14.8 or on the signature pages hereof and a
confirmation of receipt of such telecopy has been received by the sender, (ii)
if given by courier, when delivered or (iii) if given by any other means, when
delivered at the addresses specified in this Section 14.8 or on the signature
pages hereof; provided that any notice given pursuant to Section 1 hereof shall
be effective only upon receipt.

     Section 14.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterpart signature pages, and by the different parties on different
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed an original but all
such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

     Section 14.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the Borrower, the Guarantors and their respective successors and assigns, and
shall inure to the benefit of each of the Banks and the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns, including any subsequent holder of any Note.
The Borrower may not assign any of its rights or obligations under any Loan
Document without the written consent of all of the Banks. Except as otherwise
provided for herein, no Guarantor may assign any of its rights or obligations
under any Loan Document without the written consent of all the Banks.

     Section 14.11. Participants. Each Bank shall have the right at its own cost
to grant participations (to be evidenced by one or more agreements or
certificates of participation) in the Loans made and Reimbursement Obligations
and/or Commitments and/or participations in Swing Loans held by such Bank at any
time and from time to time to one or more other banks, insurance companies,
commercial lenders and other financial institutions; provided that no such
participation shall relieve any Bank of any of its obligations under this
Agreement, and provided further that no such participant shall have any rights
under this Agreement except as provided in this Section 14.11, and the Agent
shall have no obligation or responsibility to such participant. Any party to
which such a participation has been granted shall have the benefits of Section
3.6 and Section 11.3 hereof but shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under either such Section than the Bank granting such participation
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred. Any
agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest
shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to
enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation,
the right to approve any amendment or modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that such
Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement
that would (A) increase any Commitment of such Bank if such increase would also
increase the participant's obligations, (B) forgive any amount of or postpone
the date for payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation or of any fee payable hereunder in which such
participant has an interest or (C) reduce the stated rate at which interest or
fees accrue or other amounts payable hereunder in which such participant has an
interest. The Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose to any participant or
prospective participant under this Section 14.11 any financial or other
information pertaining to the Borrower, subject to Section 14.21 hereof.

     Section 14.12. Assignment Agreements. Each Bank may, from time to time upon
at least five Business Days' notice to the Agent and the Borrower, assign to
other Persons all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including without limitation the indebtedness evidenced by each Note then owned
by such assigning Bank, together with an equivalent proportion of its obligation
to make Loans and advances and participate in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans
hereunder) pursuant to written agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E executed by such assigning Bank, such assignee Bank or Banks, the Borrower and
the Agent, which agreements shall specify in each instance the portion of the
indebtedness evidenced by each Note which is to be assigned to each such
assignee lender and the portion of the Commitments, and obligations to
participate in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans, in each case of the assigning
Bank to be assumed by such assignee lender (the "Assignment Agreements");
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not
a varying, percentage of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

assignment shall cover the same percentage of such Bank's Commitments, Loans,
Notes and interests in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans; (ii) the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the assigning Bank being assigned
pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the effective date of the
relevant Assignment Agreement) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000; (iii)
unless the assigning Bank is assigning all of its Commitments, outstanding Loans
and L/C Obligations, each Bank shall maintain for its own account at least
$5,000,000 of its Revolving Credit Commitment and the Agent must retain all of
the Swing Line Commitment; (iv) the Agent and the Borrower must each consent
(which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld) to each such assignment
(except that the Borrower's consent shall not be required if such assignment is
made after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) to a party which
is not a Bank at such time except that such consents shall not be required in
connection with an assignment by a Bank to a wholly-owned subsidiary or
Affiliate of such Bank; and (v) the assigning Bank must pay to the Agent a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and any out-of-pocket attorney's fees
incurred by the Agent in connection with such Assignment Agreement. Upon the
execution of each Assignment Agreement by the assigning Bank thereunder, the
assignee lender thereunder, the Borrower (if applicable) and the Agent and
payment to such assigning Bank by such assignee lender of the purchase price for
the portion of the indebtedness of the Borrower being acquired by it, (i) such
assignee lender shall thereupon become a "Bank" for all purposes of this
Agreement with Commitments (including the related obligations to participate in
Letters of Credit and Swing Loans) in the amounts set forth in such Assignment
Agreement and with all the rights, powers and obligations afforded a Bank
hereunder, (ii) such assigning Bank shall have no further liability for funding
the portion of its Commitments (including the related obligations to participate
in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans) assumed by such new assignee Bank and
(iii) the address for notices to such assignee Bank shall be as specified in the
Assignment Agreement executed by it. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of such Assignment Agreement, the Borrower shall upon request execute
and deliver a new Revolving Credit Note to the assignee Bank in the amount of
its Revolving Credit Commitment (and a Swing Line Note if such assignee Bank is
concurrently with such assignment becoming a new Agent) after giving effect to
such assignment, all such Notes to constitute "Notes" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 14.12 shall prevent or prohibit any Bank
which is a bank, trust company or other financial institution from pledging its
Notes or Loans to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such
Bank from such Federal Reserve Bank; no such pledge, or any assignment pursuant
to or in lieu of an enforcement of such a pledge, shall relieve the transferor
Bank from its obligations hereunder.

     Section 14.13. Amendments. Any provision of the Loan Documents may be
amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed by (a) the Borrower, (b) the Required Banks, and (c) if the rights or
duties of the Agent are affected thereby, the Agent; provided that:

          (i)  no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 14.13 shall (A)
     increase any Commitment of any Bank without the consent of such Bank or (B)
     forgive, or reduce the amount of, or postpone any fixed date for payment
     of, any principal of or interest on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or
     any fee payable hereunder without the consent

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

     of each Bank or (C) reduce the stated rate at which interest or any fee
     hereunder is calculated; and

          (ii) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 14.13 shall,
     unless signed by each Bank, change any provision of Section 8, Section
     9.17, Section 10.1(a), Section 11, this Section 14.13, or the definition of
     Required Banks, or release any Guarantor, or affect the number of Banks
     required to take any action under the Loan Documents.

     Section 14.14. Headings. Section headings used in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

     Section 14.15. Legal Fees, Other Costs and Indemnification. The Borrower
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with
the preparation and negotiation of the Loan Documents, including without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of Chapman and Cutler, counsel
to the Agent, in connection with the preparation and execution of the Loan
Documents, and any amendment, waiver or consent related hereto, whether or not
the transactions contemplated herein are consummated. The Borrower further
agrees to indemnify each Bank, the Agent, and their respective directors,
officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties,
judgments, liabilities and related expenses (including, without limitation, all
expenses of litigation or preparation therefor, whether or not the indemnified
Person is a party thereto) which any of them may incur or reasonably pay arising
out of or relating to any Loan Document or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the
proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit, other than those which arise from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party claiming indemnification.
The Borrower, upon demand by the Agent or a Bank at any time, shall reimburse
the Agent or Bank for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred in
connection with investigating or defending against any of the foregoing except
if the same is directly due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
party to be indemnified.

     Section 14.16. Set Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Bank and
each subsequent holder of any Note is hereby authorized by the Borrower at any
time or from time to time, without notice to the Borrower or to any other
Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including,
but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether
matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts or premium trust
accounts, and in whatever currency denominated) and any other indebtedness at
any time held or owing by that Bank or that subsequent holder to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower, whether or not matured, against and on
account of the obligations and liabilities of the Borrower to that Bank or that
subsequent holder under the Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, all
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with the Loan
Documents, irrespective of whether or not (a) that Bank or that subsequent
holder shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) the principal of or the
interest on the Loans or Notes and other amounts due hereunder shall have become
due and payable

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 8 and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of
them, may be contingent or unmatured.

     Section 14.17. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents constitute the entire
understanding of the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof
and any prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, with
respect thereto are superseded thereby.

     Section 14.18. Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and the rights and duties of the parties hereto, shall be construed and
determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois.

     Section 14.19. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The
Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and of any Illinois State
court sitting in the City of Chicago for purposes of all legal proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court
and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower, the Agent, and each Bank hereby
irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated
thereby.

     Section 14.20. Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees to maintain in confidence
and not to disclose without the Borrower's consent (other than to its employees,
affiliates, auditors, counsel or other professional advisors, or to another
Bank, each of which shall also be bound by this Section 14.20) any information
concerning the Borrower or any Subsidiaries furnished pursuant to this Agreement
and not previously disclosed in any filing made by the Borrower with the SEC;
provided that any Bank may disclose any such information (a) that has become
generally available to the public, (b) if required or appropriate in any report,
statement or testimony submitted to any regulatory body having or claiming to
have jurisdiction over such Bank, (c) if required or appropriate in response to
any summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation, (d) in order to
comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Bank, or (e)
to any prospective or actual participant under Section 14.11 or 14.12 hereof in
connection with any contemplated or actual transfer of a participating or other
interest in such Bank's rights or obligations hereunder; provided, that (i) such
actual or prospective transferee executes an agreement with such Bank containing
provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 14.20 and
(ii) in the case of any disclosure under subsection (c) above, such Bank shall
(to the extent permitted by applicable law) notify the Borrower of such
disclosure so that the Borrower may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive such Bank's compliance with the provisions of this Section, it being
understood that if the Borrower has no right to obtain such a protective order
or if the Borrower does not commence procedures to obtain such a protective
order within ten Business Days of the receipt of such notice, such Bank's
compliance with this Section shall be deemed to have been waived with respect to
such disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, confidential
information shall not include, and each Bank and the Borrower (and each
employee, representative or other agent of

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

any Bank or the Borrower) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are or have been provided to such party relating to such tax
treatment or tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or
similar item that in either case contains information concerning such tax
treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as
other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the
document or similar item that relate to such tax treatment or tax structure.

     For Value Received, the undersigned, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., a Delaware

     The Bank shall record on its books or records or on a schedule attached to
this Note, which is a part hereof, each Revolving Loan made by it pursuant to
the Credit Agreement, together with all payments of principal and interest and
the principal balances from time to time outstanding hereon, whether the
Revolving Loan is a Domestic Rate Loan or a Eurocurrency Loan, and the interest
rate and Interest Period applicable thereto, provided that prior to the transfer
of this Note all such amounts shall be recorded on a schedule attached to this
Note. The record thereof, whether shown on such books or records or on a
schedule to this Note, shall be prima facie evidence of the same, provided,
however, that the failure of the Bank to record any of the foregoing or any
error in any such record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of
the Borrower to repay all Revolving Loans made to it pursuant to the Credit
Agreement together with accrued interest thereon.

     This Note is one of the Notes referred to in the Credit Agreement dated as
of even date herewith, among the Borrower, Harris Trust and Savings Bank,

Credit Agreement, as amended, modified or restated from time to time, being
referred to herein as the "Credit Agreement"), and this Note and the holder
hereof are entitled to all the benefits provided for thereby or referred to
therein, to which Credit Agreement reference is hereby made for a statement
thereof. All defined terms used in this Note, except terms otherwise defined
herein, shall have the same meaning as in the Credit Agreement.

     Prepayments may be made hereon and this Note may be declared due prior to
the expressed maturity hereof, all in the events, on the terms and in the manner
as provided for in the Credit Agreement.

     This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Illinois.

     The Borrower hereby promises to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) suffered or incurred by the holder hereof in

demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind hereunder except as expressly
provided in the Credit Agreement.

     This Compliance Certificate is furnished to Harris Trust and Savings Bank
as Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated as of July 21, 2003 among
Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., the Banks signatory thereto and Harris Trust and
Savings Bank, as Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined
herein, the terms used in this Compliance Certificate have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Credit Agreement.

     The Undersigned hereby certifies that:

          1.  I am the duly elected _____________________________________ of the
     Borrower;

          2.  I have reviewed the terms of the Credit Agreement and I have made,
     or have caused to be made under my supervision, a detailed review of the
     financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries during the
     accounting period covered by the attached financial statements;

          3.  The examinations described in paragraph 2 did not disclose, and I
     have no knowledge of, the existence of any condition or the occurrence of
     any event which constitutes a Default or Event of Default during or at the
     end of the accounting period covered by the attached financial statements
     or as of the date of this Certificate, except as set forth below;

          4.  The financial statements required by Section 9.4 of the Credit
     Agreement and being furnished to you concurrently with this certificate
     are, to the best of my knowledge, fairly present in all material respects
     the consolidated financial conditions of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
     as of the dates and for the periods covered thereby; and

          5.  The Attachment hereto sets forth financial data and computations
     evidencing the Borrower's compliance with certain covenants of the Credit
     Agreement, all of which data and computations are, to the best of my
     knowledge, true, complete and correct and have been made in accordance with
     the relevant Sections of the Credit Agreement.

     Described below are the exceptions, if any, to paragraph 3 by listing, in
detail, the nature of the condition or event, the period during which it has
existed and the action which the Borrower has taken, is taking, or proposes to
take with respect to each such condition or event:
