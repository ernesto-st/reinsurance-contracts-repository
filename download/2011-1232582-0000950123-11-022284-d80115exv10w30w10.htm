Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor and (b)&nbsp;has received
reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under the Loan Documents. After giving
effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of Borrower&#146;s assets exceeds and will, immediately
following the making of the Loan, exceed Borrower&#146;s total liabilities, including, without
limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. The fair saleable
value of Borrower&#146;s assets is and will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater
than Borrower&#146;s probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities on
its Debts as such Debts become absolute and matured. Borrower&#146;s assets do not and, immediately
following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its
business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to, and does not
believe that it will, incur Debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other
commitments) beyond its ability to pay such Debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into
account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on
or in respect of obligations of Borrower).

such contest operates to suspend collection or enforcement as the case may be, of the contested
Imposition, Lien or Legal Requirement and such contest is maintained and prosecuted continuously

Requirement, the failure of Borrower to comply therewith shall not impair the validity of any
insurance required to be maintained by Borrower under <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U> or the right to full
payment of any claims thereunder, and (g)&nbsp;in the case of Impositions, Permitted Debt and Liens
which are not bonded in excess of $2,000,000 individually, or in the aggregate, during such

Letter or Letters of Credit in an amount equal to 125% of (i)&nbsp;the amount of Borrower&#146;s obligations

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the creation of any such reserves or the furnishing of any bond or
other security, Borrower promptly shall comply with any contested Legal Requirement or Insurance
Requirement or shall pay any contested Imposition or Lien, and compliance therewith or payment
thereof shall not be deferred, if, at any time the Property or any portion thereof shall be, in
Lender&#146;s reasonable judgment, in imminent danger of being forfeited or lost or Lender is likely to
be subject to civil or criminal damages as a result thereof. If such action or proceeding is
terminated or discontinued adversely to Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Lender reasonable
evidence of Borrower&#146;s compliance with such contested Imposition, Lien, Legal Requirements or
Insurance Requirements, as the case may be.
