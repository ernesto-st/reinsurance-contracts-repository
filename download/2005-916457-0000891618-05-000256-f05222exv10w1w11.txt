                                    RECITALS

            A. Borrower is the direct, 100% owner of Mankato Energy Center, LLC
("MEC"), the owner of a combined cycle electric generating facility, capable of
generating approximately 375 MW of electric power, to be located in Blue Earth
County, Minnesota (the "Mankato Project").

            B. Borrower is also the direct 100% owner of both FEC-GP and FEC-LP.
FEC-GP is the sole 1%-owning general partner of Freeport Energy Center, LP
("FEC" and together with MEC, the "Project Companies"), and FEC-LP is the sole
99%-owning limited partner of FEC, the owner of a 250 MW cogeneration facility
to be located on an 8-acre site inside the Plant B industrial complex owned by
The Dow Chemical Company in Freeport, Texas (the "Freeport Project").

            C. Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide a portion of the
construction and term financing for the Mankato Project and the Freeport Project
(together, the "Projects"), which proceeds Borrower shall on-lend to the Project
Companies for the development and construction of the Projects.

            D. The Lenders are willing to provide such financing upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the other Credit
Documents.

            E. The credit facilities provided hereunder will be secured by,
among other things, the Freeport Project and the Mankato Project and guaranteed
by the Project Companies; and the Lenders would not be willing to extend such
credit facilities to Borrower, and allow Borrower to on-lend the proceeds
thereof to the Project Companies, without being provided such security and such
guaranties.

                                    AGREEMENT

            In consideration of the agreements herein and in the other Credit

time to time during the Construction Loan Availability Period such loans as

aggregate principal amount which, when added to such Lender's Proportionate
Share of the aggregate principal amount of all prior Construction Loans made
under this Agreement, does not exceed such Lender's Construction Loan

Construction Loan, which shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof; provided that such minimum

                  (v) a certification by Borrower that, as of the date such
requested Construction Loan is proposed to be made, the Construction Loan
proposed to be made on such date, when added together with all other
Construction Loans made under this Agreement, does not either (A) exceed the
Total Construction Loan Commitment or (B) cause Construction Loans applied to
Project Costs of MEC to exceed the Initial MEC Allocated Portion or Construction
Loans applied to Project Costs of FEC to exceed the Initial FEC Allocated
Portion; and

                  (vi) the amount of the requested Construction Loan that shall
be designated to constitute part of the MEC Allocated Portion and the FEC
Allocated Portion.

            Borrower shall request no more than one Construction Loan per month.
Borrower shall give each Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing to Administrative
Agent so as to provide not less than the Minimum Notice Period applicable to

of Construction Loan Borrowing shall be delivered in the manner provided in
Section 11.1.

            (c) Construction Loan Interest. Subject to Section 2.6.3, Borrower
shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Construction Loan from
the date of Borrowing of such Construction Loan until the maturity or prepayment
thereof at the following rates per annum:

                  (i) With respect to the principal portion of such Construction
Loan which is, and during such periods as such Construction Loan is, a Base Rate

change from time to time as the Base Rate shall change) plus the applicable Rate
Margin minus 0.75%.

                  (ii) With respect to the principal portion of such
Construction Loan which is, and during such periods as such Construction Loan
is, a LIBOR Construction Loan, at a rate per annum, at all times during each
Interest Period for such LIBOR Construction Loan, equal to the LIBO Rate for
such Interest Period plus the applicable Rate Margin.

                                        3

<PAGE>

            (d) Construction Loan Principal Payments. Borrower shall repay to
Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, in full on the
Construction Loan Maturity Date the unpaid principal amount of all Construction
Loans made by such Lender which will not be Term-Converted to Term Loans at such
time as is provided in Section 2.1.2(a). Borrower may not re-borrow the
principal amount of any Construction Loan so repaid.

            (e) Cancellation and Return of Construction Notes. Upon payment in
full or Term-Conversion in full of the aggregate principal amount of the
Construction Loans and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, each Lender
shall promptly mark as canceled any Construction Notes issued to it under

Notes to Borrower.

            2.1.2 Term Loan Facility.

            (a) Availability. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of
Borrower set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make to Borrower on
the Term Period Commencement Date, at the request of Borrower, a term loan under
this Section 2.1.2 (individually a "Term Loan" and, collectively, the "Term
Loans") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount
of outstanding Construction Loans made by such Lender. Each Lender shall make
its Term Loan by converting the principal amount of outstanding Construction
Loans made by such Lender to a Term Loan.

            (b) Notice of Term-Conversion. Borrower shall request
Term-Conversion by delivering to Administrative Agent a written notice in the
form of Exhibit C-2, appropriately completed (the "Notice of Term-Conversion"),
which specifies, among other things:

                  (i) the principal portion of the requested Term Loans which
shall bear interest as provided in (A) Section 2.1.2(c)(i) (individually, a
"Base Rate Term Loan" and, collectively, the "Base Rate Term Loans") or (B)
Section 2.1.2(c)(ii) (individually, a "LIBOR Term Loan" and, collectively, the
"LIBOR Term Loans");

                  (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the requested Term
Loans, which shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of all Construction
Loans outstanding on the Term Period Commencement Date (which amount shall be
calculated immediately prior to Term-Conversion, after giving effect to the
Punchlist Drawing (if any), the Dow Change Order Drawing (if any), the Dow
Performance Test Drawing (if any), the True-Up Drawing (if any), and the
application of all liquidated damages and other amounts required to be applied
to the prepayment of Construction Loans pursuant to the Depositary Agreements);

                  (iii) the proposed date of Term-Conversion (which shall be a
Banking Day on or before the Construction Loan Maturity Date); and

                  (iv) in the case of any requested Term Loan to be made as a
LIBOR Term Loan, the initial Interest Period requested therefor (which shall be
an Interest Period contemplated by Section 2.1.3(c)).

                                        4

<PAGE>

            Borrower shall deliver the Notice of Term-Conversion to
Administrative Agent so as to provide at least the Minimum Notice Period
applicable to Loans of the Type requested upon Term-Conversion; provided that
not later than 10 Banking Days prior to delivery of the Notice of
Term-Conversion, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent a draft of such
Notice of Term-Conversion and evidence documenting that the conditions to
Term-Conversion set forth in Section 3.3 will be satisfied by the proposed date
of Term-Conversion. The Notice of Term-Conversion may be modified or revoked by
Borrower through the Banking Day prior to the Minimum Notice Period, and shall
thereafter be irrevocable. The Notice of Term-Conversion shall be delivered in
the manner provided in Section 11.1.

            (c) Term Loan Interest. Subject to Section 2.6.3, Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan from the date of
Borrowing of such Term Loan until the maturity or prepayment thereof at one of
the following rates per annum:

                  (i) With respect to the principal portion of such Term Loan
which is, and during such periods as such Term Loan is, a Base Rate Term Loan,
at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (such rate to change from time to
time as the Base Rate shall change) plus the applicable Rate Margin minus 0.75%.

                  (ii) With respect to the principal portion of such Term Loan
which is, and during such periods as such Term Loan is, a LIBOR Term Loan, at a
rate per annum during each Interest Period for such LIBOR Term Loan equal to the
LIBO Rate for such Interest Period plus the applicable Rate Margin.

            (d) Term Loan Principal Payment. Beginning on the Initial Principal
Repayment Date and on each Principal Repayment Date thereafter, Borrower shall
repay to Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan made by such Lender in installments in
accordance with the repayment schedule set forth on Exhibit I, with any
remaining unpaid principal, interest, fees and costs due and payable on the Term
Loan Maturity Date. Borrower may not re-borrow the principal amount of any Term
Loan so repaid. Upon scheduled repayment of the principal of Term Loans, the
Allocated Portions shall be reduced in accordance with the scheduled
amortization thereof as set forth in the Base Case Project Projections.

            (e) Initial Principal Repayment Date Prior to Term Period
Commencement Date. If the Initial Principal Repayment Date occurs prior to the
Term Period Commencement Date, then Construction Loans in the required amount
shall be repaid first from any funds in the Borrower Revenue Account. After
application of all such funds, if there remains any required payment, then to
the extent that Administrative Agent reasonably concludes that reducing the
Total Construction Loan Commitment would not cause a failure to satisfy the
condition set forth in Section 3.2.16, then the Total Construction Loan
Commitment shall be reduced by up to such required amount, and to the extent of
such reduction, the payment will be deemed made.

            2.1.3 Interest Provisions Relating to All Loans.

            (a) Applicable Interest Rate. Subject to Section 2.6.3, the
applicable basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any
Construction Loan or Term Loan shall be selected by Borrower initially at the
time a Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing or Notice of Term-Conversion is
given pursuant to Section 2.1.1 or 2.1.2, as the case may be, and with respect
to a Security Fund LC Loan, by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a notice
in the form of Exhibit C-7, appropriately completed to notify the Lenders of the
Interest Period. The basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any
Loan may be changed from time to time as specified in a Notice of Conversion of
Loan Type delivered pursuant to Section 2.1.6. If on any day a Loan is
outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered to
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying
the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day
such Loan shall bear interest determined by reference to the Base Rate. Borrower
shall not request, and the Lenders shall not be obligated to make, LIBOR Loans
at any time an Event of Default exists.

            (b) Interest Payment Dates. Borrower shall pay accrued interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Loan (i) in the case of each Base Rate Loan,
on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, (ii) in the case of each LIBOR
Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period related to such LIBOR Loan and,
with respect to Interest Periods longer than three months, the last Banking Day
of each third month in which such LIBOR Loan is outstanding, and (iii) in all
cases, upon repayment or prepayment (to the extent thereof and including any
optional prepayments or Mandatory Prepayments), upon conversion from one Type of
Loan to another Type of Loan and at maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise).

            (c) LIBOR Loan Interest Periods.

                  (i) The initial and subsequent Interest Periods for LIBOR
Loans shall be a maximum of one month until the date which falls four months
after the Closing Date (or such earlier date as may otherwise be agreed to by
Administrative Agent and Borrower). Thereafter, each subsequent Interest Period
selected by Borrower for all LIBOR Loans shall be one, three or six months.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in either of the two preceding
sentences, (A) any Interest Period which would otherwise end on a day which is
not a Banking Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Banking Day unless
such next Banking Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such
Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding Banking Day, (B) any
Interest Period which begins on the last Banking Day of a calendar month (or on
a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month
at the end of such Interest Period) shall end on the last Banking Day of a
calendar month, (C) Borrower may not select Interest Periods which would leave a
greater principal amount of Loans subject to Interest Periods ending after a
date upon which Loans are or may be required to be repaid (including the
Construction Loan Maturity Date, the Term Loan Maturity Date and each Principal
Repayment Date) than the principal amount of Loans scheduled to be outstanding
after such date and for purposes of this clause, Borrower shall assume that all
Security Fund LC Loans will be repaid on the next Principal Repayment Date, (D)
unless Term-Conversion has occurred, any Interest Period for a Construction Loan
which would otherwise end after the

                                        6

<PAGE>

Construction Loan Maturity Date shall end on the Construction Loan Maturity
Date, (E) any Interest Period for a Term Loan which would otherwise end after
the Term Loan Maturity Date shall end on the Term Loan Maturity Date, (F) LIBOR
Loans for each Interest Period shall be in the minimum amount of $500,000 or an
integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (G) Borrower may not at any
time have outstanding more than six different Interest Periods relating to LIBOR
Loans, and (H) Borrower shall select Types and Interest Periods for Construction
Loans and Term Loans corresponding to the "types" and "interest periods" used
for floating rate payments in the Interest Rate Agreements so as to create, to
the greatest extent possible, a complete hedge.

                  (ii) Borrower may contact Administrative Agent at any time
prior to the end of an Interest Period for a quotation of Interest Rates in
effect at such time for given Interest Periods and Administrative Agent shall
promptly provide such quotation. Borrower may select an Interest Period
telephonically or by electronic mail within the time periods specified in
Section 2.1.6, which selection shall be irrevocable on and after commencement of
the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Borrower shall confirm such telephonic or
electronic mail notice to Administrative Agent by facsimile on the day such
notice is given by delivery to Administrative Agent of a written notice in
substantially the form of Exhibit C-3, appropriately completed (a "Confirmation
of Interest Period Selection"). Borrower shall promptly deliver to
Administrative Agent the original of the Confirmation of Interest Period
Selection initially delivered by facsimile. If Borrower fails to notify
Administrative Agent of the next Interest Period for any LIBOR Loans in
accordance with this Section 2.1.3(c)(ii), such Loans shall automatically
convert to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the current Interest Period
therefor. Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable (and, in any case,
within two Banking Days after delivery of the Confirmation of Interest Period
Selection) notify Borrower of each determination of the Interest Rate applicable
to each Loan.

            (d) Interest Computations. All computations of interest on Base Rate
Loans shall be based upon a year of 365 days or, in the case of a leap year, 366
days, shall be payable for the actual days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day), and shall be adjusted in accordance with any changes in
the Base Rate to take effect on the beginning of the day of such change in the
Base Rate. All computations of interest on LIBOR Loans shall be based upon a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). Borrower agrees that all computations by
Administrative Agent of interest shall be conclusive and binding in the absence
of manifest error.

            2.1.4 Promissory Notes. The obligation of Borrower to repay the
Loans made by a Lender and to pay interest thereon at the rates provided herein
shall, upon the written request of such Lender, be evidenced by promissory notes
in the form of Exhibit B-1 (individually, a "Construction Note" and,
collectively, the "Construction Notes"), Exhibit B-2 (individually, a "Term
Note" and, collectively, the "Term Notes") and Exhibit B-6 (individually, a
"Security Fund LC Loan Note" and, collectively, the "Security Fund LC Loan
Notes"), each payable to the order of such requesting Lender and in the
principal amount of such Lender's Construction Loan Commitment, Term Loan
Commitment and Security Fund LC Commitment, respectively. Borrower authorizes
each such requesting Lender to record on the schedule annexed to such

                                        7

<PAGE>

Lender's Note or Notes, the date and amount of each Loan made by such requesting
Lender, and each payment or prepayment of principal thereunder and agrees that
all such notations shall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters noted;
provided that in the event of any inconsistency between the records or books of
Administrative Agent and any Lender's records or Notes, the records of
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest
error. Borrower further authorizes each such requesting Lender to attach to and
make a part of such requesting Lender's Note or Notes continuations of the
schedule attached thereto as necessary. No failure to make any such notations,
nor any errors in making any such notations, shall affect the validity of
Borrower's obligations to repay the full unpaid principal amount of the Loans or
the duties of Borrower hereunder or thereunder. Upon the payment in full in cash
of the aggregate principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on,
the Loans, or in the case of Construction Notes, upon Term-Conversion, the
Lenders holding such Notes shall promptly mark the applicable Notes cancelled
and return such cancelled Notes to Borrower.

            2.1.5 Loan Funding.

            (a) Notice. Each Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing, Notice of
Term-Conversion and Notice of Conversion of Loan Type shall be delivered to
Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.1.1(b), 2.1.2(b) and 2.1.6,
respectively. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
contents of each Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing, Notice of
Term-Conversion and Notice of Conversion of Loan Type.

            (b) Pro Rata Loans. All Loans shall be made on a pro rata basis by
the Lenders in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares of such
Loans, with each Borrowing to consist of a Loan by each Lender equal to such
Lender's Proportionate Share of such Loan.

            (c) Lender Funding. Each Lender shall, before 1:00 p.m. on the date
of each Borrowing of a Construction Loan or Term Loan, make available to
Administrative Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in Dollars
to the account of Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose, such Lender's Proportionate Share of the Construction Loan or Term Loan
(as the case may be) to be made on such date. The failure of any Lender to make
the Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be) to be made by it as part
of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder
to make its Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be) on the date of
such Loan. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
make the Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be) to be made by such
other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

            (d) Failure of Lender to Fund. Unless Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by any Lender prior to the applicable date of a Borrowing of
a Construction Loan or Term Loan that such Lender does not intend to make
available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Proportionate
Share of the Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be) requested on
such date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount
available to Administrative Agent on such date in accordance with the prior
paragraph and Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion and in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount on such
date. If such

                                        8

<PAGE>

corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by
such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand (and, in any event, within two Banking Days from
the applicable date of such Borrowing) from such Lender together with interest
thereon, for each day from the applicable date of such Borrowing until the date
such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for the
first two Banking Days after such date. If such Lender pays such amount to
Administrative Agent, then such amount (excluding any interest paid to
Administrative Agent thereon) shall constitute such Lender's Proportionate Share
of such Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be) included in such
Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be). If such Lender does not pay
such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor
or within two Banking Days from the applicable date of such Borrowing of a
Construction Loan or Term Loan (as the case may be), Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify Borrower and Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding
amount to Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from
the applicable date of such Borrowing until the date such amount is paid to
Administrative Agent, at the rate then payable under this Agreement for Base
Rate Loans. Nothing in this Section 2.1.5(d) shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to fulfill its obligations hereunder or to prejudice
any rights that Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default
by such Lender hereunder.

            (e) Construction Accounts. No later than 2:00 p.m. on the date
specified in each Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing, if the applicable
conditions precedent listed in Article 3 have been satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms thereof and, subject to Section 2.1.5(d), to the
extent Administrative Agent shall have received the appropriate funds from the
Lenders, Administrative Agent shall make available the Construction Loans
requested in such Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing (as may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.6) in Dollars and in immediately available funds, at
Administrative Agent's New York Branch, and shall deposit or cause to be
deposited the proceeds of such Construction Loans into the Construction
Accounts.

            2.1.6 Conversion of Loans. Borrower may convert Loans from one Type
of Loan to another Type of Loan; provided, however, that (a) any conversion of
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be effective on, and only on, the first
day after expiration of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans, and (b) Loans
shall be converted only in amounts of $500,000 and increments of $100,000 in
excess thereof. Borrower shall request such a conversion by delivering to
Administrative Agent a written notice in the form of Exhibit C-4, appropriately
completed (a "Notice of Conversion of Loan Type"), which contains or specifies,
among other things:

                  (i) the Loans, or portion thereof, which are to be converted;

                  (ii) the Type of Loans into which such Loans, or portion
thereof, are to be converted;

                  (iii) if such Loans are to be converted into LIBOR Loans, the
initial

                                        9

<PAGE>

Interest Period selected by Borrower for such Loans (which Interest Period shall
be selected in accordance with Section 2.1.3(c));

                  (iv) the proposed date of the requested conversion (which
shall be a Banking Day and otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.1.6); and

                  (v) a certification by Borrower that no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

Borrower shall so deliver each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type so as to
provide at least the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Any Notice of Conversion
of Loan Type may be modified or revoked by Borrower through the Banking Day
prior to the Minimum Notice Period, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. Each
Notice of Conversion of Loan Type shall be delivered in the manner provided in
Section 11.1. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
contents of each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type.

            2.1.7 Prepayments.

            (a)   Terms of All Prepayments.

                  (i) Upon the prepayment of any Loan (whether such prepayment
is an optional prepayment under Section 2.1.7(b) or a Mandatory Prepayment),
Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender which
made such Loan and/or Hedge Bank, as applicable, (A) all accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment on the amount of such Loan prepaid, (B) all accrued fees
to the date of such prepayment relating to the amount of such Loan being
prepaid, (C) to the extent required by the terms of the applicable Interest Rate
Agreement, all Hedge Breaking Fees owed by Borrower to such Hedge Bank as a
result of such prepayment, and (D) if such prepayment is the prepayment of a
LIBOR Loan on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR
Loan, all Liquidation Costs incurred by such Lender as a result of such
prepayment (pursuant to the terms of Section 2.9).

                  (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, but only in respect of any
Mandatory Prepayment, Borrower shall have the right, by giving five Banking
Days' notice to Administrative Agent, in lieu of prepaying a LIBOR Loan on a day
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan, to deposit or
cause Administrative Agent to deposit into an account to be held by Depositary
Agent (which account shall be subjected to the Lien of the Collateral Documents
in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Collateral Agent) an amount equal to the
LIBOR Loans to be prepaid. Such funds shall be held in such account until the
expiration of the Interest Period applicable to the LIBOR Loan to be prepaid at
which time the amount deposited in such account shall be used to prepay such
LIBOR Loan and any interest accrued on such amount shall be deposited into the
Borrower Revenue Account. The deposit of amounts into such account shall not
constitute a prepayment of Loans and all Loans to be prepaid using the proceeds
from such account shall continue to accrue interest at the then applicable
interest rate for such Loans until actually prepaid. All amounts in such account
shall only be invested in Permitted Investments as directed by and at the
expense and risk of Borrower.

                                       10

<PAGE>

                  (iii) Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, all
prepayments of Term Loans shall be applied to reduce the remaining payments
required under Section 2.1.2(d) in inverse order of maturity. Prepayment of Term
Loans with proceeds of the Purchase Option or Put Option pursuant to Section 3.6
of the Borrower Depositary Agreement shall be applied as described in such
section. Any prepayments made pursuant to Sections 3.5.4(f) and 3.7.1 of the
applicable Project Company Depositary Agreement shall be applied to reduce the
Allocated Portion for the Project with respect to which such prepayments have
been received. Prepayment of Term Loans with proceeds of Construction Contractor
Performance LDs pursuant to Section 3.7 of the applicable Project Company
Depositary Agreement and Section 3.8 of the Borrower Depositary Agreement shall
be applied to all maturities of the Term Loans ratably. Borrower may not
re-borrow the principal amount of any Construction Loan or Term Loan which is
prepaid. In connection with any prepayment of loans made pursuant to Section
3.4.2(c) of the Borrower Depositary Agreement, the Allocated Portions shall be
reduced in proportion to their size relative to the aggregate Term Loan.

            (b) Optional Prepayments. Subject to Section 2.1.7(a), Borrower may,
at its option and without premium or penalty, upon five Banking Days' notice to
Administrative Agent, prepay (i) any Construction Loans in whole or from time to
time in part in minimum amounts of $1,000,000 or an incremental multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof (provided that such minimum amounts shall not apply
to a prepayment of all outstanding Construction Loans), (ii) any Term Loans in
whole or from time to time in part in minimum amounts of $1,000,000 or an
incremental multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (provided that such minimum
amounts shall not apply to a prepayment of all outstanding Term Loans), or (iii)
any Security Fund LC Loans in whole or from time to time in part in minimum
amounts of $1,000,000 or an incremental multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof
(provided that such minimum amounts shall not apply to a prepayment of all
outstanding Security Fund LC Loans); provided, however, that as a condition to
Borrower's right to make any prepayment of Construction Loans, Borrower shall
reduce the Total Construction Loan Commitment in accordance with Section 2.3.3
of this Agreement by such amount that the Available Construction Loan Commitment
equals zero after giving effect to such prepayment. In connection with any
optional prepayments, Borrower shall terminate or partially terminate Hedge
Transactions such that the notional amount under all of the Hedge Transactions
does not exceed, in the aggregate, the principal amount of Loans outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such prepayment. In connection with any
optional prepayments, Borrower may at the time of such prepayment specify the
portions by which Allocated Portions shall be reduced thereby, and absent such
specification, the Allocated Portions shall be reduced in proportion to their
size relative to the aggregate Term Loan.

            (c) Mandatory Prepayments. Borrower shall prepay (or cause to be
prepaid) Loans to the extent required by Section 11.23, Sections 3.2.2(d),
3.4.2(c) (second sentence), 3.4.2(e), 3.6 or 3.8 of the Borrower Depositary
Agreement, Sections 2.2(b), 3.5.4(e), 3.5.4(f) or 3.7.1(b) of the Project
Company Depositary Agreements (by virtue of requiring transfer of funds to the
Mandatory Prepayment Account), Section 3.1.6(b) of the FEC Depositary Agreement,
or any other provision of any Credit Document which expressly requires such
prepayment (such prepayment, a "Mandatory Prepayment").

                                       11

<PAGE>

            2.1.8 Register. Administrative Agent shall maintain, at its address
referred to in Section 11.1, a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, the Commitments and Loans of each Lender from time to
time and the name of each Lender which holds a Note, as well as a record of
which payments or prepayments have been applied to which Allocated Portions from
time to time (the "Register"). The Register shall be available for inspection by
Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. Administrative Agent shall record in the Register (a)
the Commitments and the Loans from time to time of each Lender, (b) the interest
rates applicable to all Loans and the effective dates of all changes thereto,
(c) the Interest Period for each LIBOR Loan, (d) the date and amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower
to each Lender hereunder, (e) each repayment or prepayment in respect of the
principal amount of the Loans of each Lender, (f) the amount of any sum received
by Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof, (g) on each Principal Repayment Date or any other time
any principal of the Loans is paid or prepaid, the Allocated Portion to which
any such principal payment or prepayment is being applied, as well as the
resulting revised Allocated Portions, and (h) such other information as
Administrative Agent may determine is necessary for the administering of the
Loans and this Agreement. Any such recording shall be conclusive and binding in
the absence of manifest error; provided that neither the failure to make any
such recordation, nor any error in such recordation, shall affect any Lender's
Commitment or Borrower's Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans or
otherwise; and provided further that in the event of any inconsistency between
the Register and any Lender's records, the Register shall govern absent manifest
error.

      2.2   SECURITY FUND LC FACILITY.

            2.2.1 Issuance of the Security Fund LC. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date the LC Issuer shall
issue a letter of credit in the form of Exhibit B-5 (the "Security Fund LC") for
the account of Borrower and for the benefit of NSP, in the initial stated amount
of $18,250,000. The Security Fund LC shall be made available solely in lieu of
the "HGC" portion of the Security Fund pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Power
Purchase Agreement. If such section requires or permits that the stated amount
of the Security Fund LC be modified, based on the Sponsor's Credit Rating (as
defined in the Power Purchase Agreement) changing, Borrower shall request of LC
Issuer (and, if a reduction, NSP) to effect such change, and LC Issuer shall
effect such change, it being understood that the stated amount of the Security
Fund LC shall never be increased to exceed $23,500,000 (if prior to the Facility
Acceptance Date for the Mankato Project), or $19,200,000 (if following the
Facility Acceptance Date for the Mankato Project).

            2.2.2 Security Fund LC Loans. To the extent provided in Section
2.2.5, each Lender severally agrees to advance to LC Issuer, for the account of
Borrower, such Lender's Proportionate Share of the full amount of any Drawing
Payment under the Security Fund LC. Upon such advance, the Drawing Payment shall
be deemed to constitute a loan made by such Lender to Borrower in the amount
advanced (a "Security Fund LC Loan"). All Security Fund

                                       12

<PAGE>

LC Loans shall be repaid in accordance with Section 3.2.2 of the Borrower
Depositary Agreement, with any remaining unpaid principal, interest, fees and
costs due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date. Borrower may not re-borrow
the principal amount of any Security Fund LC Loan so repaid.

            2.2.3 Security Fund LC Loan Interest. Borrower shall pay interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Security Fund LC Loan from the date of the
applicable Drawing Payment until the maturity or repayment thereof at the
following rates per annum:

                  (a) with respect to the principal portion of such Security
Fund LC Loan which is, and during such periods as such Security Fund LC Loan is,
a Base Rate Security Fund LC Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
(such rate to change from time to time as the Base Rate shall change) plus the
applicable Rate Margin minus 0.75%; and

                  (b) with respect to the principal portion of such Security
Fund LC Loan which is, and during such periods as such Security Fund LC Loan is,
a LIBOR Security Fund LC Loan, at a rate per annum during each Interest Period
for such LIBOR Security Fund LC Loan equal to the LIBO Rate for such Interest
Period plus the applicable Rate Margin.

            2.2.4 Reduction and Reinstatement of Stated Amount. The Stated
Amount of the Security Fund LC shall be reduced by the amount of Drawing
Payments made in respect thereof. After a draw upon the Security Fund LC, where
the terms of Section 11.1(E) of the Power Purchase Agreement (as in effect on
the Closing Date) require the Stated Amount to thereafter be increased, without
further condition or consent of the Lenders, the Stated Amount of the Security
Fund LC shall be increased in the required amount by the LC Issuer issuing to
NSP an amendment in the form attached to the Security Fund LC, any such
increases not to exceed the Unutilized Security Fund LC Commitment.

            2.2.5 Lender Participation. Each Lender severally agrees to
participate with LC Issuer in the extension of credit arising from the issuance
of the Security Fund LC in an amount equal to such Lender's Proportionate Share
of the Total Security Fund LC Commitment, and the issuance of the Security Fund
LC shall be deemed a confirmation to LC Issuer of such participation in such
amount. LC Issuer may request the Lenders to pay to LC Issuer their respective
Proportionate Shares of all or any portion of any Drawing Payment made or to be
made by LC Issuer under the Security Fund LC by contacting each Lender and
Administrative Agent telephonically (promptly confirmed in writing) at any time
after LC Issuer has received notice of or request for such Drawing Payment, and
specifying the amount of such Drawing Payment, such Lender's Proportionate Share
thereof, and the date on which such Drawing Payment is to be made or was made.
Upon receipt of any such request for payment from LC Issuer, each Lender shall
pay to LC Issuer such Lender's Proportionate Share of the unreimbursed portion
of such Drawing Payment, together with interest thereon at a per annum rate
equal to the Federal Funds Rate, as in effect from time to time, from the date
of such Drawing Payment to the date on which such Lender makes payment. Each
Lender's obligation to make each such payment to LC Issuer shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence or continuance of

                                       13

<PAGE>
any Inchoate Default or Event of Default, or the failure of any other Lender to
make any payment under this Section 2.2.5, and each Lender further agrees that
each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
reduction whatsoever. Nothing in this Section 2.2.5 shall limit or affect the
obligation of the LC Issuer to make any Drawing Payment pursuant to the Security
Fund LC.

      2.3   TOTAL COMMITMENTS.

            2.3.1 Security Fund Letter of Credit. The initial stated amount of
the Security Fund LC shall be as set forth in Section 2.2.1, and any increases
in the stated amount thereof shall not exceed at any time the Unutilized
Security Fund LC Commitment.

            2.3.2 Loan Commitment Amounts.

            (a) Total Construction Loan Commitment. Notwithstanding anything
that may be construed to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate principal
amount of all Construction Loans made by the Lenders shall not exceed the lesser
of (i) $466,500,000 and (ii) if such total amount is reduced by Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.3.3, such lower amount (such amount, so reduced from time
to time, the "Total Construction Loan Commitment").

            (b) Total Term Loan Commitment. Notwithstanding anything that may be
construed to the contrary in this Agreement, the aggregate principal amount of
all Term Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the aggregate amount of
Construction Loans outstanding on the Term-Period Commencement Date after giving
effect to any Punchlist Drawing, any Dow Change Order Drawing, any Dow
Performance Test Drawing and any True-Up Drawing (such amount, as reduced from
time to time, the "Total Term Loan Commitment").

            2.3.3 Reductions and Cancellations. Borrower may, from time to time
upon five Banking Days written notice to Administrative Agent, permanently
reduce (without premium or penalty), by an amount of $1,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or cancel in its entirety the Total
Construction Loan Commitment, subject to the provisions of this Section 2.3.3.
Borrower may not reduce the Total Security Fund LC Commitment or the Unutilized
Security Fund LC Commitment. Borrower may not reduce or cancel the Total
Construction Loan Commitment if, after giving effect to such reduction or
cancellation, (a) the aggregate principal amount of all Construction Loans then
outstanding would exceed the Total Construction Loan Commitment, (b) the
Available Construction Funds would not, in the reasonable judgment of
Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer, exceed remaining Project
Costs (including budgeted contingency (or the appropriate part thereof) and
anticipated Liquidation Costs and anticipated Hedge Breaking Fees arising from
any prepayment related to such reduction or cancellation), or (c) such reduction
or cancellation would cause an Inchoate Default, Event of Default or have a
Material Adverse Effect. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent any
Commitment Fees then due in respect of the canceled portion of the applicable
Commitment upon any cancellation and, from the effective date of any
cancellation or reduction, the Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of
the Available Construction

                                       14

<PAGE>

Loan Commitment as so canceled or reduced. Once reduced or canceled, the Total
Construction Loan Commitment may not be increased or reinstated. Any reductions
pursuant to this Section 2.3.3 shall be applied ratably to each Lender's
respective Commitments in accordance with Section 2.7.1.

      2.4   FEES.

            2.4.1 Administrative Agent's Fees. Borrower shall pay to
Administrative Agent solely for Administrative Agent's account the fees and
other amounts described in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter.

            2.4.2 Commitment Fees.

            (a) Construction Loan Commitment Fees. On each Quarterly Payment
Date on and until the Construction Loan Maturity Date (or, if the Total
Construction Loan Commitment is canceled prior to such date, on the date of such
cancellation), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of
the Lenders, accruing from the Closing Date or the first day of such quarter, as
the case may be, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") for such quarter (or
portion thereof) then ending equal to the product of (i) the daily average
unutilized Construction Loan Commitment for such quarter (or portion thereof)
multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
that calendar quarter and the denominator of which is 360 multiplied by (iii)
0.50%, payable quarterly in arrears through Term-Conversion.

            (b) Unutilized Security Fund LC Commitment Fee. On each Quarterly
Payment Date, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders, accruing from the Closing Date or the first day of the Payment Period,
as the case may be, a commitment fee for such quarter (or portion thereof) then
ending equal to the product of (i) the daily average Unutilized Security Fund LC
Commitment for such quarter (or portion thereof) multiplied by (ii) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in that calendar quarter and the
denominator of which is 360 multiplied by (iii) 0.50%, payable quarterly in
arrears.

      2.5   SECURITY FUND LC FEES.

            2.5.1 Security Fund LC Fee. On each Quarterly Payment Date, Borrower
shall pay to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, a Security
Fund LC fee (the "Security Fund LC Fee") for each Payment Period (or portion
thereof) then ending, equal to the product of (a) the daily average Stated
Amount of the Security Fund LC for such Payment Period (or portion thereof)
multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
such Payment Period (or portion thereof) and the denominator of which is 360,
multiplied by (c) the applicable Rate Margin.

                                       15

<PAGE>

            2.5.2 Fronting Fee. On each Quarterly Payment Date, Borrower shall
pay to Administrative Agent, solely for LC Issuer's account, a letter of credit
fronting fee for the corresponding Payment Period (or portion thereof) equal to
the product of (a) the daily average Stated Amount of the Security Fund LC
multiplied by (b) 0.20% multiplied by (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in that calendar quarter and the denominator of which is 360.

      2.6   OTHER PAYMENT TERMS.

            2.6.1 Place and Manner. Except as otherwise provided in the
Arrangement Fee Letter, the Administrative Agent Fee Letter or any other
provision contained in any of the Credit Documents, Borrower shall make all
payments due to any Lender, Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent hereunder
to Administrative Agent, for the account of such Lender, Collateral Agent or
Administrative Agent (as the case may be), to the account in the name of Loan
Servicing, Account No. 01-88179-2145-00, ABA No. 026-008-073, Reference: Calpine
Steamboat Holdings, LLC, or such other account as Administrative Agent shall
notify Borrower from time to time, in Dollars and in immediately available funds
not later than 12:00 noon on the date on which such payment is due. Any payment
made after such time on any day shall be deemed received on the Banking Day
after such payment is received. Administrative Agent shall disburse to each
Lender or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) each such payment received by
Administrative Agent for such Lender or Collateral Agent (as the case may be),
such disbursement to occur on the day such payment is received if received by
12:00 noon or if otherwise reasonably possible, or otherwise on the next Banking
Day.

            2.6.2 Date. Whenever any payment due hereunder shall fall due on a
day other than a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Banking Day, and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of
interest or fees, as the case may be, without duplication of any interest or
fees so paid in the next subsequent calculation of interest or fees payable.

            2.6.3 Default Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default,
the outstanding principal amount of all Loans and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, any accrued but unpaid interest payments thereon
and any accrued but unpaid fees, and other amounts hereunder, shall thereafter
bear interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under
applicable Bankruptcy Laws) payable upon demand, and the Security Fund LC Fees
shall be increased, at a rate that is (a) 2% per annum in excess of the interest
rate and Security Fund LC Fees then otherwise payable under this Agreement with
respect to the applicable Loans and Security Fund LC, or (b) in the case of any
such fees and other amounts, at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the
interest rate then otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans
(the "Default Rate"); provided that, in the case of LIBOR Loans, upon the
expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time any such increase in
interest rate is effective, such LIBOR Loans shall thereupon become Base Rate
Loans and shall thereafter bear interest payable upon

                                       16

<PAGE>

demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate then
otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans.

            2.6.4 Net of Taxes, Etc.

            (a) Taxes. Any and all payments to or for the benefit of
Administrative Agent or any Lender by Borrower hereunder or under any other
Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or
withholding, setoff or counterclaim of any kind whatsoever and in such amounts
as may be necessary in order that all such payments, after deduction for or on
account of any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (excluding net income and
franchise taxes, which include taxes imposed on or measured by the net income,
net profits or capital of Administrative Agent or such Lender by any
jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein
as a result of a connection between such Lender and such jurisdiction or
political subdivision, unless such connection results solely from such Lender's
executing, delivering or performing its obligations or receiving a payment
under, or enforcing, this Agreement or any Note) (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"), shall be equal to the amounts otherwise
specified to be paid under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. If any
Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder or under any other Credit Document to Administrative Agent or
any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.6.4),
Administrative Agent or such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make (or
cause to be made) such deductions, and (iii) Borrower shall pay (or cause to be
paid) the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. In addition,
Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp, recording or documentary
taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (not
including income or franchise taxes) that arise under the laws of the United
States of America, the State of New York, the State of Texas or the State of
Minnesota from any payment made hereunder or under any other Credit Document or
from the execution or delivery or otherwise with respect to this Agreement or
any other Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

            (b) Tax Indemnity. Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for and hold
it harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.6.4) paid by any Lender, or any liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted; provided that
Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any Lender for any penalties,
interest or expenses relating to Taxes or Other Taxes arising from such Lender's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Lender agrees to give written
notice to Borrower of the assertion of any claim against such Lender relating to
such Taxes or Other Taxes as promptly as is practicable after being notified of
such assertion, and in no event later than 180 days after the

                                       17

<PAGE>

principal officer of such Lender responsible for administering this Agreement
obtains knowledge thereof; provided that any Lender's failure to notify Borrower
of such assertion within such 180 day period shall not relieve Borrower of its
obligation under this Section 2.6.4 with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes,
penalties, interest or expenses arising prior to the end of such period, but
shall relieve Borrower of its obligations under this Section 2.6.4 with respect
to Taxes or Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses between the end of such
period and such time as Borrower receives notice from such Lender as provided
herein. Payments by Borrower pursuant to this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days from the date such Lender makes written demand therefor
(submitted through Administrative Agent), which demand shall be accompanied by a
certificate describing in reasonable detail the basis thereof.

            (c) Notice. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by
Borrower, Borrower shall furnish to Administrative Agent, at its address
referred to in Section 11.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof or, if such receipt is not obtainable, other evidence
of such payment by Borrower reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.
Borrower shall compensate each Lender for all reasonable losses and expenses
sustained by such Lender as a result of any failure by Borrower to so furnish
such copy of such receipt.

            (d) Conduit Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 2.6.4, if a Lender is a conduit entity participating
in a conduit financing arrangement (as defined in Section 7701(l) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder) with respect to any payments
made by Borrower under this Agreement and under any Note, Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay additional amounts to such Lender pursuant to this Section
2.6.4 to the extent that the amount of Taxes exceeds the amount that would have
otherwise been payable were such Lender not a conduit entity participating in a
conduit financing arrangement.

            (e) Reimbursement by Lenders. If any Lender receives an
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 2.6.4(b) and if such Lender is able,
in its sole opinion, to apply or otherwise take advantage of any refund or tax
credit arising out of or in conjunction with any Taxes or Other Taxes which give
rise to such indemnification, such Lender shall, to the extent that in its sole
opinion it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such
refund or credit and without any other adverse tax consequences for such Lender,
reimburse to Borrower at such time as such tax refund or credit shall have
actually been received by such Lender such amount as the Lender shall, in its
sole opinion, have determined to be attributable to the relevant Taxes or Other
Taxes and as will leave such Lender in no better or worse position than it would
have been in if the payment of such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been required.
Nothing in this Section 2.6.4(e) shall oblige any Lender to disclose to Borrower
or any other Person any information regarding its tax affairs or tax
computations, or shall interfere with Lender's absolute discretion to arrange
its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit. In particular, no Lender shall
be under any obligation to claim relief from its corporate profits or similar
tax liability in credits or deductions available to it and, if it does claim,
the extent, order and manner in which it does so shall be at its absolute
discretion.

                                       18

<PAGE>

            (f) Survival of Obligations. The obligations of Borrower under this
Section 2.6.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of Borrower's Obligations.

            2.6.5 Application of Payments. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein or in the other Credit Documents, payments made under this
Agreement or the other Credit Documents and other amounts received by
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent or the Lenders under
this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall first be applied to any fees,
costs, charges or expenses payable to Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent,
Depositary Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Credit Documents,
next to any accrued but unpaid interest then due and owing, and then to
outstanding principal then due and owing or otherwise to be prepaid (in each
case, such application to be made on a pro rata basis among such applicable
Persons).

            2.6.6 Withholding Exemption Certificates. Administrative Agent on
the Closing Date, each Lender upon becoming a Lender and each Person to which
any Lender grants a participation (or otherwise transfers its interest in this
Agreement) agree that they will deliver to Administrative Agent and Borrower
either (a) if such Lender or Person is a United States person (other than a
corporation established under the laws of the United States or any political
subdivision thereof), an executed copy of a United States Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9, or (b) if such Lender or Person is not a corporation
established under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision
thereof, two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case may be
(certifying therein an entitlement to an exemption from, United States
withholding taxes) plus, in the case of a Lender or a Person using the so-called
"portfolio interest exemption," a duly completed and executed non-bank
certificate in the form of Exhibit J, if applicable. Each Lender which delivers
to Borrower and Administrative Agent a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI pursuant to the
preceding sentence further undertakes to deliver to Borrower and Administrative
Agent further copies of the Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable
forms, or other manner of certification or procedure, as the case may be, on or
before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or within a
reasonable time after gaining knowledge of the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent forms previously delivered by it to Borrower, and
such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by Borrower,
certifying in the case of a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes, unless in any such cases an event (including
any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which
any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent a Lender from duly completing and delivering
any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises Borrower that it is not
capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax. Borrower shall not be obligated, however, to pay any
additional amounts in respect of United States federal income tax pursuant to
Section 2.6.4 (or make an indemnification payment pursuant to Section 2.6.4) to
any Lender (including any entity to which any Lender sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement) if

                                       19

<PAGE>

the obligation to pay such additional amounts (or such indemnification) would
not have arisen but for a failure of such Lender to comply with its obligations
under this Section 2.6.6.

      2.7   PRO RATA TREATMENT.

            2.7.1 Borrowings, Commitment Reductions, Etc. Except as otherwise
provided herein, (a) each Borrowing consisting of Construction Loans, Term
Loans, Security Fund LC Loans or each Drawing Payment under the Security Fund LC
and each reduction of the Total Construction Loan Commitment, Total Term Loan
Commitment or Total Security Fund LC Commitment shall be made or allocated among
the Lenders pro rata according to their respective Proportionate Shares of such
Loans or Commitments, as the case may be, (b) each payment of principal of and
interest on Construction Loans, Term Loans or Security Fund LC Loans shall be
made or shared among the Lenders holding such Loans or Commitments pro rata
according to their respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans or
Commitments held by such Lenders, and (c) each payment of Commitment Fees shall
be shared among the Lenders pro rata according to (i) their respective
Proportionate Shares of the Commitments to which such fees apply, and (ii) in
the case of each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement hereunder after
the Closing Date, the date upon which such Lender so became a party hereunder.

            2.7.2 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
setoff, or otherwise) on account of Loans owed to it, in excess of its
Proportionate Share of payments on account of such Loans obtained by all Lenders
entitled to such payments, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other
Lenders such participation in the Loans, as the case may be, as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably
with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from
such Lender shall be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the
purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together
with an amount equal to such other Lender's Proportionate Share (according to
the proportion of (a) the amount of such other Lender's required repayment to
(b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or
other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total
amount so recovered. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.7.2 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

      2.8   CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

            2.8.1 Inability to Determine Rates. If, on or before the first day
of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Loans, (a) Administrative Agent determines
that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period cannot be adequately and reasonably
determined due to the unavailability of

                                       20

<PAGE>

funds in or other circumstances affecting the London interbank market, or (b)
Lenders holding aggregate Proportionate Shares of 33-1/3% or more of the
Commitments shall advise Administrative Agent that (i) the rates of interest for
such LIBOR Loans do not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
of making or maintaining such Loans, or (ii) deposits in Dollars in the London
interbank market are not available to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by
each such Lender in good faith in writing to Administrative Agent and to
Borrower) in the ordinary course of business in sufficient amounts to make
and/or maintain their LIBOR Loans, then Administrative Agent shall immediately
give notice of such condition to Borrower. After the giving of any such notice
and until Administrative Agent shall otherwise notify Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such condition no longer exist, Borrower's right to
request the making of or conversion to, and the Lenders' obligations to make or
convert to, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. Any LIBOR Loans outstanding at the
commencement of any such suspension shall be converted at the end of the then
current Interest Period for such Loans into Base Rate Loans unless such
suspension has then ended.

            2.8.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption
of any Governmental Rule, any change in any Governmental Rule or the application
or requirements thereof (whether such change occurs in accordance with the terms
of such Governmental Rule as enacted, as a result of amendment, or otherwise),
any change in the interpretation or administration of any Governmental Rule by
any Governmental Authority, or compliance by any Lender or Borrower with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law, but if not having
the force of law, being of a type with which a Lender customarily complies) of
any Governmental Authority (a "Change of Law") shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan, then such Lender
shall immediately notify Administrative Agent and Borrower of such Change of
Law. Upon receipt of such notice, (a) Borrower's right to request the making of
or conversion to, and the Lender's obligations to make or convert to, LIBOR
Loans shall be suspended for so long as such condition shall exist, and (b)
Borrower shall, at the request of such Lender, either (i) pursuant to Section
2.1.6, convert any then outstanding LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans at the end
of the current Interest Periods for such Loans, or (ii) immediately repay LIBOR
Loans pursuant to Section 2.1.7 or convert LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans if
such Lender shall notify Borrower that such Lender may not lawfully continue to
fund and maintain such Loans. Any conversion or prepayment of LIBOR Loans made
pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to the last day of an Interest Period
for such Loans shall be deemed a prepayment thereof for purposes of Section 2.9.

            2.8.3 Increased Costs. If, after the date of this Agreement, any
Change of Law:

            (a) shall subject any Lender or LC Issuer (the term "Lender" as used
below in this Section to include LC Issuer) to any tax, duty or other charge
with respect to any LIBOR Loan or Commitment in respect thereof, or shall change
the basis of taxation of payments by Borrower to any Lender on such a Loan or
with respect to any such Commitment (except for Taxes, Other Taxes or changes in
the rate of taxation on the overall net income of any Lender); or

                                       21

<PAGE>

            (b) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement (without duplication of any reserve requirement
included within the applicable Interest Rate through the definition of "Reserve
Requirement") against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for
the account of, advances or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds by any
Lender for any LIBOR Loan; or

            (c) shall impose on any Lender any other condition directly related
to any LIBOR Loan or Commitment in respect thereof;

and the effect of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, issuing, creating, renewing, participating in (subject to the
limitations in Section 9.13) or maintaining any such LIBOR Loan or Commitment in
respect thereof or to reduce any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder,
then Borrower shall from time to time, within 10 days after demand by such
Lender, pay to such Lender additional amounts sufficient to reimburse such
Lender for such increased costs or to compensate such Lender for such reduced
amounts. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such
increased costs or reduced amounts and the basis for determination of such
amount, submitted by such Lender to Borrower, shall, in the absence of manifest
error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower for purposes of this Agreement.

            2.8.4 Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that (a) any
Change of Law after the date of this Agreement increases the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, or the Lending Office of
such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender (a "Capital Adequacy
Requirement"), and (b) the amount of capital maintained by such Lender or such
Person which is attributable to or based upon the Loans, the Commitments or this
Agreement must be increased as a result of such Capital Adequacy Requirement
(taking into account such Lender's or such Person's policies with respect to
capital adequacy), then Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Person, within
10 days after delivery of demand by such Lender or such Person, such amounts as
such Lender or such Person shall reasonably determine are necessary to
compensate such Lender or such Person for the increased costs to such Lender or
such Person of such increased capital. A certificate of such Lender or such
Person, setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of any such increased
costs, delivered to Borrower by such Lender or such Person shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower for purposes of this
Agreement.

            2.8.5 Notice; Participating Lenders' Rights. Each Lender shall
notify Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that
will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.8, as
promptly as practicable, and in no event later than 180 days after the principal
officer of such Lender responsible for administering this Agreement obtains
knowledge thereof; provided that any Lender's failure to notify Borrower within
such 180 day period shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation under this
Section 2.8 with respect to claims arising prior to the end of such period, but
shall relieve Borrower of its obligations under this Section 2.8 with respect to
the time between the end of such period and such time as Borrower receives
notice from the indemnitee as provided herein. No Person purchasing from a
Lender a participation in any Commitment (as opposed to an assignment) shall be
entitled to any payment from or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to Section 2.8.3
or Section 2.8.4 which would

                                       22

<PAGE>

be in excess of the applicable proportionate amount (based on the portion of the
Commitment in which such Person is participating) which would then be payable to
such Lender if such Lender had not sold a participation in that portion of the
Commitment.

      2.9   FUNDING LOSSES.

            If Borrower shall (a) repay or prepay any LIBOR Loans on any day
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans (whether an
optional prepayment or a Mandatory Prepayment), (b) fail to borrow any LIBOR
Loans in accordance with a Notice of Construction Loan Borrowing delivered to
Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any
applicable conditions or otherwise) after such Notice of Construction Loan
Borrowing has become irrevocable, (c) fail to convert any Loans into LIBOR Loans
in accordance with a Notice of Conversion of Loan Type delivered to
Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any
applicable conditions or otherwise) after such Notice of Conversion of Loan Type
has become irrevocable, (d) fail to continue a LIBOR Loan in accordance with a
Confirmation of Interest Period Selection delivered to Administrative Agent, (e)
fail to convert any Construction Loans into Term Loans in accordance with a
Notice of Term Conversion delivered to Administrative Agent (whether as a result
of a failure to satisfy any applicable conditions or otherwise), or (f) fail to
make any prepayment in accordance with any notice of prepayment delivered to
Administrative Agent, then Borrower shall, within 10 days after demand by any
Lender, reimburse such Lender for all reasonable costs and losses incurred by
such Lender as a result of such repayment, prepayment or failure ("Liquidation
Costs"). Borrower understands that such costs and losses may include losses
incurred by a Lender as a result of funding and other contracts entered into by
such Lender to fund LIBOR Loans (other than non-receipt of the margin applicable
to such LIBOR Loans). Each Lender demanding payment under this Section 2.9 shall
deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for and the amount of costs and losses for which demand is made. Such a
certificate so delivered to Borrower shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding as to the amount of such loss for purposes of this
Agreement.

      2.10  ALTERNATE OFFICE; MINIMIZATION OF COSTS.

            2.10.1 To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall
designate an alternative Lending Office with respect to its LIBOR Loans and
otherwise take any reasonable actions to reduce any liability of Borrower to any
Lender under Section 2.6.4, 2.8.3, 2.8.4 or 2.9, or to avoid the unavailability
of any Type of Loans under Section 2.8.2 so long as (in the case of the
designation of an alternative Lending Office) such Lender, in its sole
discretion, determines that (a) such designation is not disadvantageous to such
Lender and (b) such actions would eliminate or reduce liability to such Lender.
Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any
Lender in connection with any such designation or actions within 10 Banking Days
of demand thereof to Borrower.

                                       23

<PAGE>

            2.10.2 If and with respect to each occasion that a Lender either
makes a demand for compensation pursuant to Section 2.6.4, 2.8.3 or 2.8.4 or is
unable for a period of three consecutive months to fund LIBOR Loans pursuant to
Section 2.8.2 or such Lender wrongfully fails to fund a Loan, then Borrower may,
upon at least five Banking Days' prior irrevocable written notice to each of
such Lender and Administrative Agent, in whole permanently replace the Loans and
Commitments of such Lender; provided that Borrower shall replace such Loans and
Commitments with the Loans and Commitments of a commercial bank reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent, and with respect to the Security Fund LC
Commitment, reasonably satisfactory to the LC Issuer. Such replacement Lender
shall upon the effective date of replacement purchase the Borrower's Obligations
hereunder owed to such replaced Lender for the aggregate amount thereof and
shall thereupon for all purposes become a "Lender" hereunder. Such notice from
Borrower shall specify an effective date for the replacement of such Lender's
Loans and Commitments, which date shall not be later than the fourteenth day
after the day such notice is given. On the effective date of any replacement of
such Lender's Loans and Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.10.2, Borrower
shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender (a) any fees
due to such Lender to the date of such replacement, (b) the principal of and
accrued interest on the principal amount of outstanding Loans held by such
Lender to the date of such replacement (such amount to be represented by the
purchase of the Borrower's Obligations hereunder of such replaced Lender by the
replacing Lender and not as a prepayment of such Loans), and (c) the amount or
amounts due to such Lender pursuant to each of Sections 2.6.4, 2.8.3 and 2.8.4,
as applicable, and any other amount then payable hereunder to such Lender.
Borrower will remain liable to such replaced Lender for any Liquidation Costs
that such Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of the purchase of such
Lender's Loans (unless such Lender has defaulted on its obligation to fund a
Loan hereunder). Upon the effective date of the purchase of any Lender's Loans
owed to such Lender and termination of such Lender's Commitments pursuant to
this Section 2.10.2, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder. No such
termination of any such Lender's Commitments and the purchase of such Lender's
Loans pursuant to this Section 2.10.2 shall affect (i) any liability or
obligation of Borrower or any other Lender to such terminated Lender, or any
liability or obligation of such terminated Lender to Borrower or any other
Lender, which accrued on or prior to the date of such termination, or (ii) such
terminated Lender's rights hereunder in respect of any such liability or
obligation.

            2.10.3 Upon written notice to Administrative Agent, any Lender may
designate a Lending Office other than the Lending Office most recently
designated to Administrative Agent and may assign all of its interests under the
Credit Documents and its Notes (if any) to such Lending Office; provided that
such designation and assignment do not at the time of such designation and
assignment increase the reasonably foreseeable liability of Borrower under
Section 2.6.4, 2.8.3 or 2.8.4 or make an Interest Rate option unavailable
pursuant to Section 2.8.2.

<PAGE>

            The obligation of each Lender to enter into this Agreement and to
make the initial Construction Loans under this Agreement and of the LC Issuer to
issue the Security Fund LC is subject to the prior satisfaction of each of the
following conditions (unless waived in writing by Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Lenders) (the date such conditions precedent are so satisfied or
waived being referred to as the "Closing Date"):

            3.1.1 Resolutions. Delivery to the Lead Arrangers of a copy of one
or more resolutions or other authorizations, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lenders, of each Borrower Party, each other Affiliate of
Borrower that is a party to an Operative Document as of the Closing Date (each
such Affiliate, an "Affiliated Major Project Participant" and, together with
each Borrower Party, the "Calpine Entities") certified by a Responsible Officer
of each such Calpine Entity as being in full force and effect on the Closing
Date, authorizing, as applicable and among other things, the Borrowings herein
provided for, the granting of the Liens under the Collateral Documents, the
contribution of equity to the Project Companies and the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Operative Documents and any

materials to be paid for with the proceeds of the requested Construction Loan or
disbursement of non-Loan proceeds, as applicable.

            (a) All Applicable Permits, required to have been obtained by the

and the Independent Engineer to assure (i) restoration of such Project to
substantially the same operating and performance parameters (including

action, suit, proceeding or investigation shall have been instituted or
threatened in writing against Borrower, the Benefiting Project Company, the
applicable Major Project Participants or the applicable Project which could

            No Construction Loans shall Term-Convert unless the following
conditions shall have been satisfied or waived in writing by Administrative
Agent with consent of the Majority Lenders (the date such conditions are so
satisfied or waived being referred to as the "Term Period Commencement Date"):

            3.3.1 Credit Event Conditions. The conditions set forth in Section
3.2, with the exception of Sections 3.2.5-3.2.9 and 3.2.16, shall have been
satisfied as of the date of Term-Conversion.

            3.3.2 Payment of Obligations. Borrower shall have paid to
Administrative Agent the principal amount of the Construction Loans outstanding
which will not be Term-Converted to Term Loans as provided in Section 2.1.2,
plus all interest due and owing through such date on such Construction Loans and

Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the Lenders hereunder or under any
other Credit Document.

            3.3.3 Punchlist Drawing; Dow Change Order Drawing; Dow Performance
Test Drawing; True-Up Drawing.

            (a) Punchlist Drawing. Prior to Term-Conversion, Borrower shall have
made a drawing up to any then-remaining Available Construction Loan Commitment
(the "Punchlist Drawing") in an amount equal to, when aggregated with any
amounts then on deposit (or being simultaneously deposited) in the respective
Construction Accounts immediately prior to such Punchlist Drawing, the amount
necessary to fund in full the payments set forth in Section 3.1.3 of the Project
Company Depositary Agreements for Punchlist and other items necessary to achieve
Final Completion of both Projects. The amounts drawn for Punchlist items
pursuant to this Section 3.3.3(a) shall be deposited into the applicable Project
Company Construction Account.

            (b) Dow Change Order Drawing. If, after giving effect to the making
of the Punchlist Drawing (if any), (i) there remains any Available Construction
Loan Commitment on

                                       37

<PAGE>

the Term Period Commencement Date and (ii) Dow has elected less than $5,000,000
of changes pursuant to Section 2.3.2 of the Capacity Sales Agreement, then
Borrower, at its election, may draw additional Construction Loans at or prior to
Term-Conversion (the "Dow Change Order Drawing"), in an amount up to the lesser
of (A) $5,000,000 minus the cost of changes which Dow did elect pursuant to such
section, and (B) $4,000,000. Such amount shall be deposited into Borrower's
Revenue Account.

            (c) Dow Performance Test Drawing. Solely in the event that any
performance tests at the Freeport Project have been deferred pursuant to
Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of the Capacity Sales Agreement (a "Dow Test
Deferral"), then if, after giving effect to the making of the Punchlist Drawing
(if any) and Dow Change Order Drawing (if any), there remains any Available
Construction Loan Commitment, then Borrower shall draw additional Construction
Loans on the Term Period Commencement Date in an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) the Available Construction Loan Commitment and (ii) the Dow Performance Test
Exposure. The amount of such drawing (the "Dow Performance Test Drawing Amount"
shall be deposited into the First Step Construction Sub-Account pursuant to
Section 3.1.1(h) of the FEC Depositary Agreement.

            (d) True-Up Drawing. If, after giving effect to the making of the
Punchlist Drawing (if any), the Dow Change Order Drawing (if any), and the Dow
Performance Test Drawing (if any), (i) there remains any Available Construction
Loan Commitment and (ii) the Debt to Equity Ratio (as determined in accordance
with Section 5.10(b)) is less than the Target Debt to Equity Ratio, then
Borrower, at its election, may draw additional Construction Loans on the Term
Period Commencement Date (the "True-Up Drawing") in an amount up to the lesser
of (i) the amount of the then-remaining Available Construction Loan Commitment,
and (ii) an amount which, after giving effect to the making of the Punchlist
Drawing (if any), the Dow Change Order Drawing (if any), and the Dow Performance
Test Drawing (if any), yields the Target Debt to Equity Ratio. Such amount shall
be deposited into the Borrower Revenue Account. After the True-Up Drawing, any
remaining Construction Loan Commitment shall be cancelled.

            3.3.4 Completion. Completion with respect to each Project shall have
occurred and Borrower shall have delivered to Administrative Agent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, a certification that
Completion with respect to each Project has occurred.

            3.3.5 Annual Budget. Administrative Agent shall have received the
Annual Operating Budget for each Project as required under Section 5.14.3 for
the period from the Term Period Commencement Date through the end of the
calendar year in which Term-Conversion is to occur; provided that if such period
is less than three months, Administrative Agent shall have also received the
Annual Operating Budget for each Project for the first full calendar year
thereafter. In the event that either such Annual Operating Budget does not, in
Administrative Agent's reasonable opinion acting in consultation with the
Independent Engineer, properly reflect the operation of the applicable Project
during such calendar year as a result of the actual date of Term-Conversion
being different from the date anticipated therefor and set forth in such

                                       38

<PAGE>

Annual Operating Budget, Administrative Agent shall have received an amendment
to such Annual Operating Budget properly reflecting the actual date of
Term-Conversion upon written request to Borrower for the same.

            3.3.6 Debt Service Reserve Account. On the Term Period Commencement
Date, the amount on deposit in or credited to the Debt Service Reserve Account,
together with the stated amount of any Qualified Letter of Credit available for
payment to Administrative Agent for disbursement to the Debt Service Reserve
Account, shall be not less than 50% of the DSR Required Balance, and each
Project Company has available to it in its O&M Account or in use as working
capital the amount of working capital required under the applicable Depositary
Agreement.

            3.3.7 Term Notes. Borrower shall have delivered duly executed Term
Notes to each Lender, if any Lender shall have requested such Term Notes in
writing pursuant to Section 2.1.4 or 9.14.

            3.3.8 Delivery of Documents. Administrative Agent shall have
received, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent,
such date-down opinions, resolutions, certificates and other evidence as
Administrative Agent may reasonably request in writing to ensure Administrative
Agent's reasonable satisfaction with the matters covered in Sections 3.1.8 (with
respect solely to Borrower Parties), 3.1.6 (with respect to any Credit Document
or Project Document not previously delivered) and 3.1.10.

            3.3.9 Sufficient Funds for Initial Principal Repayment Date. In the
event that Term-Conversion takes place less than three months prior to the
Initial Principal Repayment Date, Borrower shall have demonstrated to
Administrative Agent's reasonable satisfaction that amounts retained in the
Revenue Accounts after Term-Conversion plus anticipated Project Revenues prior
to the Initial Principal Repayment Date will be sufficient to make the payments
of principal and interest due on the Initial Principal Repayment Date.

      3.4 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO USE OF PROCEEDS OUTSIDE OF INITIAL ALLOCATED
PORTIONS.

            Prior to "Substantial Completion" under the MEC Construction
Contract and funding of the Punchlist Drawing for the Mankato Project, Borrower
may not draw any Construction Loan in an amount which would cause a violation of
the Initial Allocated Portion requirements set forth in Section 2.1.1(a), unless
the following conditions shall have been satisfied or waived in writing by
Administrative Agent with consent of the Majority Lenders:

            3.4.1 The Initial Allocated Portion of the Project Company requiring
additional funds shall have been fully expended.

            3.4.2 The Independent Engineer shall have certified that the
remaining Commitments are sufficient for Completion of both Projects, and the
Administrative Agent shall have provided consent for the additional draw based
upon the Independent Engineer's certification.

                                       39

<PAGE>

      3.5   NO APPROVAL OF WORK.

                  The making of any Loan hereunder shall in no event be deemed
an approval or acceptance by Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, the Lenders
or any other Secured Party of any work, labor, supplies, materials or equipment
furnished or supplied with respect to the Projects.

      3.6   ADJUSTMENT OF DRAWDOWN REQUESTS.

                  In the event Administrative Agent determines that any item
listed in a Drawdown Certificate as a Project Cost is not properly included in
such Drawdown Certificate, Administrative Agent may in its reasonable discretion
cause to be made a Loan or Loans in the amount requested in such Drawdown
Certificate less the amount of such item or may reduce the amount of Loans made
pursuant to any subsequent Drawdown Certificate. In the event that Borrower
prevails in any dispute as to whether such Project Costs were properly included
in such Drawdown Certificate, Loans in the amount requested but not initially
made shall forthwith be made.

                                    ARTICLE 4

meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

      4.8   ERISA.

funding standards of ERISA and the Code for each ERISA Plan, (ii) each such Plan
is in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code, and (iii) neither any Calpine Entity nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to the PBGC or an ERISA Plan or
Multiemployer Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums

            There are no Permits under existing Legal Requirements as the
Projects are currently designed that are or will become Applicable Permits other
than the Permits listed in Exhibit G-1 (as such Exhibit may be supplemented by

any Permit after the Closing Date). Except as disclosed in Exhibit G-1 (as so
supplemented), each Permit listed in Part I of Exhibit G-1 is in full force and
effect and is not subject to any current legal proceeding or to any Unsatisfied
Condition that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and all applicable appeal periods with respect thereto have expired. Each Permit
listed in Part II of Exhibit G-1 is of a type that is routinely granted upon
submission of a timely application and demonstration that the Projects comply
with applicable standards and Legal Requirements. No Permit listed in Part II is
required under applicable Legal Requirements or Project Documents to be obtained
before the time contemplated to be obtained by the applicable Borrower Party or
Dow. No fact or circumstance exists, to any Borrower Party's knowledge, which
makes it likely that any Permit identified in Part II of Exhibit G-1 shall not
be timely obtainable by the applicable Borrower Party or Dow before it becomes
an Applicable Permit without expense in excess of amounts provided therefor in
the then-current Project Budget or the then-current Annual Operating Budget, as
the case may be, and without delay materially in excess of the time provided
therefor in the Project Schedule (if applicable). Each Borrower Party and Dow is
in compliance with all Applicable Permits except to the extent such
noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

      4.13  PROJECT DOCUMENTS.

            4.13.1 Copies of all of the Major Project Documents and Major
Equipment Contracts executed on or prior to such date have been delivered to
Administrative Agent. Since the Closing Date, except as has been disclosed to

            4.13.2 To Borrower's knowledge, except as disclosed to
Administrative Agent in writing at or prior to the time the representation and
warranty in this Section 4.13.2 is being made, the representations and
warranties of the Major Project Participants contained in the Operative

respects except where the untruth of such representation and warranty could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      4.14  DISCLOSURE.

            Neither this Agreement nor any certificate or other documentation
(other than the Project Budgets, the Annual Operating Budgets or the Base Case
Project Projections) furnished or verified by a Borrower Party to the Lead

Credit Documents or the design, construction, description or operation of the
Projects, contained (at the time of delivery or verification thereof) any untrue

<PAGE>

Collateral Agent, or the Lenders by or on behalf of any Borrower Party on or
prior to the Closing Date in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

      4.15  PRIVATE OFFERING BY BORROWER.

            Assuming that each Lender is acquiring its Notes for investment
purposes only, and not for purposes of resale or distribution thereof except for
assignments or participations as provided in Sections 9.13 and 9.14, no
registration of such Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
under the securities laws of the States of Texas, Minnesota or New York is
required in connection with the offering, issuance and sale of such Notes
hereunder. No Borrower Party or anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will
take, any action which would subject the issuance or sale of any Notes to
Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

      4.16  TAXES.

            (a) Each Borrower Party has timely filed, or caused to be filed, all
federal, state and local tax returns and reports that it is required to file,
has paid all taxes, material assessments, utility charges, fees and other
governmental charges it is required to pay to the extent due (other than those
taxes that it is contesting in good faith and by appropriate proceedings in
accordance with the requirements of Section 5.20). Borrower knows of no proposed
tax assessment against any Borrower Party or any other Calpine Entity which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than those
proposed tax assessments that any Borrower Party is contesting in good faith and
by appropriate proceedings in accordance with the requirements of Section 5.20).
In either case, to the extent such taxes, assessments, charges and fees are not
due, the applicable Calpine Entity has established reserves that are adequate
for the payment thereof in conformity with GAAP.

            (b) At all times since its formation, each Borrower Party has been
an entity with a single owner (with the exception of FEC which has two owners)
that is disregarded as separate from its owner for federal tax purposes. No Form
8832 has ever been filed with respect to any Borrower Party as other than a
disregarded entity and no such election shall have been made.

            (c) No Borrower Party has liability for the taxes of any Person
(other than such Borrower Party) (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee
or successor, (iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.

            (d) No Borrower Party intends to treat the Loans (including the
incurrence thereof) as being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4).

      4.17  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.

                                       51

electricity, steam, capacity or ancillary services therefrom or the entering
into any Operative Document in respect of the Projects or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, be subject to, or not exempt from, regulation
under the FPA or PUHCA or under state laws and regulations respecting the rates
or the financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities, except that
(a) MEC is subject to the compliance requirements under PUHCA applicable to an
Exempt Wholesale Generator and an owner of an Eligible Facility, (b) each of MEC
and CES is a "public utility" subject to FERC jurisdiction under the FPA with
authority to sell wholesale electric power at market based rates, and with all

services at market based rates, (c) FEC is subject to the requirements under
PURPA and the regulations of FERC promulgated thereunder, as amended from time
to time, necessary to be a Qualifying Facility, (d) FEC is subject to state laws
and regulations respecting the rates or the financial or organizational

Collateral Documents, with respect to MEC and the Mankato Project may be subject
to Section 32 of PUHCA and Section 203, 204 and/or 205 of the FPA. Except to the
extent provided in the first sentence of this Section 4.17, no Borrower Party
will be deemed by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be subject
to financial, organizational or rate regulation as an "electric utility",
"electric corporation", "electrical company", "public utility", "holding
company", or "public utility holding company" or any similar Person under any
applicable Governmental Rule then in effect.

      4.18  REGULATION U, ETC.

            No Borrower Party is engaged principally, or as one of its principal
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of "buying",
"carrying" or "purchasing" margin stock (each as defined in Regulations T, U or
X of the Federal Reserve Board), and no part of the proceeds of the Loans or the
Project Revenues will be used by any Borrower Party for the purpose of "buying",
"carrying" or "purchasing" any such margin stock or for any other purpose which
violates the provisions of the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.

      4.19  BUDGETS; PROJECTIONS.

            Borrower has prepared the Project Budgets, the Annual Operating
Budgets and the Base Case Project Projections and is responsible for developing
the assumptions on which such Project Budgets, Annual Operating Budgets and the
Base Case Project Projections are based; and such Project Budgets, Annual
Operating Budgets and the Base Case Project Projections (a) as of the date
delivered, updated or supplemented are based on reasonable assumptions
(including as to all legal and factual matters material to the estimates set
forth therein), (b) as of the date delivered, updated or supplemented are
consistent in all material respects with the provisions of the Project Documents
executed on or prior to such date, and (c) as of the date delivered, updated or

            In the case of each financial statement of each Borrower Party
(other than the financial statements delivered by any Borrower Party pursuant to
Sections 3.1.16(a) and (e)) and accompanying information delivered by each
Borrower Party under the Credit Documents (insofar as financial statements
relate to each such Borrower Party), each such financial statement and
information has been prepared in conformity with GAAP and fairly presents, in
all material respects, the financial position (on a consolidated and, where
applicable, consolidating basis) of each Borrower Party, as the case may be,
described in such financial statements as at the respective dates thereof and

applicable, consolidating basis) of each Borrower Party, as the case may be,
described therein for each of the periods then ended, subject, in the case of
any such unaudited financial statements, to changes resulting from audit and
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure. Except for
obligations under the Operative Documents to which it is a party, each Borrower
Party does not (and will not following the funding of the initial Loans) have
any contingent obligations, unmatured liabilities, contingent liability or
liability for taxes, long-term lease or forward or long-term commitment required
to be shown under GAAP that is not reflected in the foregoing financial
statements or the notes thereto and which in any such case is material in
relation to the business, results of operations, properties, financial condition
or prospects of each Borrower Party.

            4.22.2 All of the Collateral (other than the Accounts, the
membership interests in any Borrower Party, general intangibles and the Siemens
Turbines) is, or when installed pursuant to the Project Documents will be,

      4.23  TITLE AND LIENS.

                                       53
<PAGE>

            Borrower has good, legal and valid title to the Collateral in which
it grants the Collateral Agent a Lien. FEC has good and indefeasible title to
the Collateral in which it grants the Collateral Agent a Lien and a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest in the FEC Site and its interest in the
Easements, in each case free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances or other
exceptions to title other than Permitted Liens. MEC has good, marketable and
insurable fee simple interest in the Collateral in which it grants the
Collateral Agent a Lien, in each case free and clear of all Liens, encumbrances
or other exceptions to title other than Permitted Liens. The Lien of the
Collateral Documents constitutes a valid and subsisting first priority lien of
record on all the FEC Mortgaged Property described in the FEC Deed of Trust and
MEC Mortgage described in the MEC Mortgage and a first priority perfected
security interest in all the personal property described in the Collateral
Documents, subject to no Liens except Permitted Liens.

      4.24  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

            Except as disclosed in Exhibit G-5:

            (a) Each Borrower Party owns, possesses or has entered into
contracts with others who possess all licenses, permits, franchises,
authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names,
or rights thereto, that are necessary for the operation of its business, without
known conflict with the rights of others.

            (b) No product of any Borrower Party infringes in any material
respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright,
service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person.

            (c) There is no violation by any Person of any right of any Borrower
Party with respect to any patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name
or other right owned or used by any Borrower Party.

            (d) There exists no pending or threatened claim or litigation
against or affecting any Borrower Party contesting its right to sell or use any
such product, process, method, substance, part or other material.

      4.25  COLLATERAL.

            The respective liens and security interests granted to Collateral
Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) pursuant to the Collateral
Documents (a) constitute as to personal property included in the Collateral a
valid security interest, and (b) constitute as to the FEC Mortgaged Property and
the MEC Mortgaged Property included in the Collateral a valid lien and security
interest in the FEC Mortgaged Property and the MEC Mortgaged Property,
respectively. The security interest granted to Collateral Agent (for the benefit
of the Secured Parties) pursuant to the Collateral Documents in the Collateral
consisting of personal property will be perfected (i) with respect to any
property that can be perfected by filing, upon the filing of financing
statements in the filing offices identified in Exhibit D-9, (ii) with respect to
any property that can be perfected by control, upon execution of the Control
Agreements and the Depositary Agreements, and (iii) with respect to any property
(if any) that can be perfected by possession,

                                       54
<PAGE>

upon Collateral Agent receiving possession thereof, and in each case such
security interest will be, as to Collateral perfected under the UCC or otherwise
as aforesaid, superior and prior to the rights of all third Persons now existing
or hereafter arising whether by way of mortgage, lien, security interests,
encumbrance, assignment or otherwise, except (i) Title Exceptions and Permitted
Liens described in clauses (a) and (e) of the definition of "Permitted Liens",
and (ii) to the extent required by Governmental Rule, those matters described in
clauses (b), (c) and (g) of the definition of "Permitted Liens". Except to the
extent possession of portions of the Collateral is required for perfection, all
such action as is necessary has been taken to establish and perfect Collateral
Agent's rights in and to the Collateral in existence on such date to the extent
Collateral Agent's security interest can be perfected by filing, including any
recording, filing, registration, giving of notice or other similar action. As of
the Closing Date, no filing, recordation, re-filing or re-recording other than
those listed on Exhibit D-9 hereto is necessary to perfect and maintain the
perfection of the interest, title or Liens of the Collateral Documents, and on
the Closing Date all such filings or recordings will have been made to the
extent Collateral Agent's security interest can be perfected by filing. Each
Borrower Party has properly delivered or caused to be delivered, or provided
control, to Collateral Agent or Depositary Agent with respect to all Collateral
that permits perfection of the Lien and security interest described above by
possession or control.

such intention, it will promptly notify

                                       56

(or any successor sections), and the Administrative Agent and such Lender or
Lenders, as applicable, may file such Internal Revenue Service forms or maintain

            5.8.2 Each Project Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent
within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter after the Project Commercial
Operation Date with respect to the Freeport Project and the Facility Acceptance
Date with respect to the Mankato Project, a summary operating report with
respect to each Project, which shall include, with respect to the period most
recently ended, the information set forth on the Template Operating Report, as
further described in the annotations thereto.

            5.8.3 Each Project Company shall provide to Administrative Agent
promptly upon request such reports, statements, lists of property, accounts,
budgets, forecasts and other information concerning its Project and, to the
extent reasonably available, the Major Project Participants and at such times as
Administrative Agent shall reasonably require, including such reports and
information as are reasonably required by the Independent Consultants.

            5.8.4 Each Project Company shall within 30 days after each annual
policy renewal date, deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate,
substantially in the form of Exhibit L, and otherwise in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent in

                                       63
<PAGE>

consultation with the Insurance Consultant, certifying that the insurance
requirements of Exhibit K have been implemented and are being complied with in
all material respects.

            5.8.5 If in any year either Project Company's gross merchant
revenues (defined as gross revenues deriving from merchant sales, minus the cost
of fuel and other direct expenses) amount to less than 80% of the Project's
gross merchant revenues set forth in the Base Case Project Projections, then at
Borrower's expense, the Administrative Agent may commission the Power Market
Consultant or any replacement thereto, to perform a market study for the market
in which the Project is located.

      5.9  EXISTENCE, CONDUCT OF BUSINESS, PROPERTIES, ETC.

            Except as otherwise expressly permitted under this Agreement, each
Borrower Party shall (a) maintain and preserve its existence as a Delaware
limited liability company in the case of Borrower, a Delaware limited
partnership in the case of FEC, a Delaware limited liability company in the case
of FEC-GP, a Delaware limited liability company in the case of FEC-LP, and a
Delaware limited liability company in the case of MEC, and all material rights,
privileges and franchises necessary in the normal conduct of its business, (b)
subject to Section 5.2.2, perform (to the extent not excused by force majeure
events or the nonperformance of the other party and not subject to a good faith
dispute) all of its material contractual obligations under the Major Project
Documents to which it is party or by which it is bound, (c) maintain and, in the
case of FEC, cause Dow to maintain, all Applicable Permits, except to the extent
that any such failure to maintain could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (d) at or before the time that any Permit becomes
an Applicable Permit, obtain such Permit.

      5.10  DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO; DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO.

            (a) Following Term-Conversion, no later than 10 Banking Days after
each Principal Repayment Date, Borrower shall calculate and deliver to
Administrative Agent the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Calculation Period
for such Principal Repayment Date. The calculations of Debt Service Coverage
Ratios hereunder shall be used in determining the application and distribution
of funds pursuant to Section 6.6, and Section 3.3 of the Borrower Depositary
Agreement.

            (b) No later than five Banking Days prior to the making of any
True-Up Drawing pursuant to Section 3.3.3(d), or any distribution pursuant to
Section 3.1.5 of the FEC Depositary Agreement, Borrower shall calculate and
deliver to Administrative Agent the Debt to Equity Ratio (after giving effect to
the making of the Punchlist Drawing (if any), the Dow Change Order Drawing, (if
any) and the Dow Performance Test Drawing (if any)), together with such written
information as is necessary for Administrative Agent to verify the Debt to
Equity Ratio. Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower in writing of any
suggested corrections, changes or adjustments to such calculations within three
Banking Days after receipt. Borrower shall incorporate all such corrections,
changes or adjustments as are required

                                       64

<PAGE>

to accurately reflect the Debt to Equity Ratio, and (if necessary) shall
promptly recalculate and resubmit to Administrative Agent such calculations.

      5.11  INDEMNIFICATION.

            5.11.1 Each Borrower Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Lead Arranger, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, LC Issuer, and each
Lender, and in their capacities as such, their respective officers, directors,
shareholders, controlling Persons, employees, agents and servants (collectively,
the "Indemnitees") from and against and reimburse the Indemnitees for:

            (a) any and all claims, obligations, liabilities, losses, damages,
injuries (to Person, property, or natural resources), penalties, stamp or other
similar taxes, actions, suits, judgments, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees) of whatever kind or nature, whether or not well
founded, meritorious or unmeritorious, demanded, asserted or claimed against any
such Indemnitee (collectively, "Subject Claims") in any way relating to, or
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the other Operative
Documents to which it is a party, except for claims by a Calpine Entity against
an Indemnitee that are in whole or in part successful;

            (b) any and all Subject Claims arising in connection with the
Release or presence of any Hazardous Substances at either Project, whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable, including all costs of removal, investigation,
remediation and disposal of such Hazardous Substances, all reasonable costs
required to be incurred in (i) determining whether such Project is in
compliance, and (ii) causing such Project to be in compliance, with all
applicable Legal Requirements, all reasonable costs associated with claims for
damages to Persons or property, and reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees
and court costs; and

            (c) any and all Subject Claims in any way relating to, or arising
out of or in connection with any claims, suits or liabilities against any
Borrower Party or any of its Affiliates to the extent related to the Projects or
the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents.

            5.11.2 The foregoing indemnities shall not apply with respect to an
Indemnitee, to the extent arising as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee, but shall continue to apply to other Indemnitees.

            5.11.3 The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive foreclosure
of the Collateral Documents and satisfaction or discharge of Borrower's
obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents to which it is a
party, and shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies of the Lead
Arrangers, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and any Lender.

                                       65
<PAGE>

            5.11.4 In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought
against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall notify the applicable Borrower
Party of the commencement thereof, and such Borrower Party shall be entitled, at
its expense, acting through counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee, to
participate in, and, to the extent that such Borrower Party desires, to assume
and control the defense thereof. Such Indemnitee shall be entitled, at its
expense, to participate in any action, suit or proceeding the defense of which
has been assumed by such Borrower Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
Borrower Party shall not be entitled to assume and control the defenses of any
such action, suit or proceedings if and to the extent that, in the reasonable
opinion of such Indemnitee and its counsel, such action, suit or proceeding
involves the potential imposition of criminal liability upon such Indemnitee or
a conflict of interest between such Indemnitee and such Borrower Party or
between such Indemnitee and another Indemnitee (unless such conflict of interest
is waived in writing by the affected Indemnitees), and in such event (other than
with respect to disputes between such Indemnitee and another Indemnitee) such
Borrower Party shall pay the reasonable expenses of such Indemnitee in such
defense.

            5.11.5 If a Borrower Party has assumed the defense of any action,
suit or proceeding pursuant to Section 5.11.4, such Borrower Party shall
promptly report to such Indemnitee on the status of such action, suit or
proceeding as material developments shall occur and from time to time as
requested by such Indemnitee (but not more frequently than every 60 days). Such
Borrower Party shall deliver to such Indemnitee a copy of each document filed or
served on any party in such action, suit or proceeding, and each material
document which such Borrower Party possesses relating to such action, suit or
proceeding.

            5.11.6 Notwithstanding each Borrower Party's rights hereunder to
control certain actions, suits or proceedings:

            (a) if any Indemnitee reasonably determines that failure to
compromise or settle any Subject Claim made against such Indemnitee is
reasonably likely to subject such Indemnitee to civil, criminal or
administrative penalties, to result in the loss, suspension or impairment of a
license or Permit held by such Indemnitee or to cause material damage to such
Indemnitee's reputation, such Indemnitee shall be entitled to compromise or
settle such Subject Claim; and

            (b) if the Majority Lenders reasonably determine that failure to
compromise or settle any Subject Claim made against such Indemnitee is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, Administrative Agent shall
provide the applicable Borrower Party with written notice of a proposed
compromise or settlement of such claim specifying in detail the nature and
amount of such proposed settlement or compromise. Such Borrower (and any other
relevant Calpine Entity) shall be deemed to have approved such proposed
compromise or settlement unless, within 30 days after the date such Borrower
receives such notice of intended compromise or settlement, such Borrower
provides the Lenders with a written legal analysis from counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Majority Lenders reasonably concluding that, based on the
magnitude of the Subject Claim, the legal basis for such Subject Claim, or the
cost of defending such Subject Claim, the amount of such proposed settlement or
compromise is not

                                       66
<PAGE>

within a reasonable range of settlements or compromises for such Subject Claim,
and indicating, based on such factors, such counsel's view as to the appropriate
amount of a reasonable settlement or compromise for such Subject Claim (the
"Settlement Amount"). If the Lenders receive such legal analysis required by
this Section 5.11.6 within such 30-day period, then (i) the Majority Lenders may
elect to settle or compromise such Subject Claim and such Borrower Party shall
be responsible for the payment of all amounts of such compromise or settlement
up to 125% of the Settlement Amount, (ii) such Indemnitee shall be responsible
for payment of all amounts of such compromise or settlement in excess of such
125% limit, and (iii) such compromise or settlement shall be binding upon the
Borrower Party. If the Borrower Party does not provide such legal analysis
within such period, or if such legal analysis is not reasonable, in the
reasonable determination of the Majority Lenders, then such Indemnitee may
settle or compromise such Subject Claim (and such Borrower Party shall cause any
other relevant Calpine Entity to agree to the same) and shall be fully
indemnified by such Borrower Party therefor. The Lenders shall not otherwise
settle or compromise any such Subject Claim other than at their own expense.

            5.11.7 Upon payment of any Subject Claim by the applicable Borrower
Party pursuant to this Section 5.11 or other similar indemnity provisions
contained herein to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, such Borrower Party, without
any further action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such
Indemnitee may have relating thereto, and such Indemnitee shall cooperate with
such Borrower Party and such Borrower Party's insurance carrier and give such
further assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable such Borrower Party
vigorously to pursue such claims.

            5.11.8 Any amounts payable by a Borrower Party pursuant to this
Section 5.11 shall be regularly payable within 30 days after such Borrower Party
receives an invoice for such amounts from any applicable Indemnitee, and if not
paid within such 30-day period shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

            5.11.9 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
such Borrower Party shall not, in connection with any one legal proceeding or
claim, or separate but related proceedings or claims arising out of the same
general allegations or circumstances, in which the interests of the Indemnitees
do not materially differ, be liable to the Indemnitees (or any of them) under
any of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.11 for the fees and expenses
of more than one separate firm of attorneys (which firm shall be selected by the
affected Indemnitees, or upon failure to so select, by Administrative Agent).

            5.11.10 If, for any reason whatsoever, the indemnification provided
under this Section 5.11 is unavailable to any Indemnitee or is insufficient to
hold it harmless to the extent provided in this Section 5.11, then provided such
payment is not prohibited by or contrary to any applicable Governmental Rule,
Legal Requirement or public policy, such Borrower Party shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of the Subject Claim in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of
such Borrower Party and its Affiliates on the one hand, and such Indemnitee on
the other hand, in the matters contemplated by this Agreement as well as the
relative fault of such Borrower Party (and its

                                       67
<PAGE>

Affiliates) and such Indemnitee with respect to such Subject Claim, and any
other relevant equitable considerations.

            5.11.11 Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall constitute a release by a
Borrower Party of any claims that it has as a result of a breach or a default by
any of the Secured Parties of their respective obligations under this Agreement
or any other Credit Document.

      5.12  EXEMPTION FROM REGULATION.

            Each applicable Project Company shall take or cause to be taken all
necessary or appropriate actions so that (a) (i) MEC will be an Exempt Wholesale
Generator and (ii) the Mankato Project will be an Eligible Facility at all times
hereunder, (b) the Freeport Project will be a Qualifying Facility at all times
hereunder, (c) except to the extent provided in the first sentence of Section
4.17, each Project shall not be subject to, or shall be exempt from, financial
or organizational regulation as a "public utility company" or "public utility
holding company" under PUHCA or financial, organizational or rate regulation as
a public utility under the laws of the State of Minnesota in the case of MEC or
Texas in the case of FEC, as presently constituted and as construed by the
courts of Minnesota and Texas, respectively, (d) MEC will be authorized to sell
electricity at market-based rates, with all waivers of regulations and blanket
authorizations as are customarily granted by FERC to entities with market-based
rate authority, and (e) FEC shall not be subject to regulation as a "public
utility" under the FPA.

      5.13  CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECTS.

            (a) Each Project Company shall cause its Project to be constructed
and equipped substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, the
then-current Project Budget, the Construction Contracts and the other Major
Project Documents, as any of the same may be amended from time to time pursuant
to Section 6.12.

            (b) Each Project Company shall terminate, as applicable, either the
FEC Construction Contract or the MEC Construction Contract under the terms
provided for therein or in the applicable Consent, upon receipt of notice from
Administrative Agent upon direction of the Majority Lenders and after
consultation with the applicable Project Company that (i) there has been an
Event of Default (as defined in the applicable Construction Contract) by CCMCI
in the performance of its obligations under such Construction Contract, or (ii)
there has been a Bankruptcy Event of CCMCI or Sponsor and, as a result thereof,
in the opinion of the Majority Lenders, there exists the reasonable possibility
that CCMCI will not be able to perform all of its obligations under such
Construction Contract in a manner consistent with the terms thereof and of the
other Operative Documents (including Section 5.13(a) hereof). Upon any such
termination of a Construction Contract, the applicable Project Company shall
replace CCMCI as construction contractor with an entity approved by the Majority
Lenders, under a construction contract approved by the Majority Lenders.

      5.14  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PROJECTS; ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET.

            5.14.1 Each Project Company shall keep its Project, or cause the
same to be kept, in an operating condition consistent with the standard of care
set forth in the O&M Agreements, all Applicable Permits, Legal Requirements and
the Operative Documents, and make or cause to be made all repairs (structural
and non-structural, extraordinary or ordinary) necessary to keep the Projects in
such condition.

            5.14.2 Each Project Company shall operate its Project, or cause the
same to be operated, in a manner consistent with Prudent Utility Practices and
in compliance with the terms of the Power Purchase Agreement, including any MAPP
requirements as defined and described therein, in the case of the Mankato
Project and with the terms of the Dow Agreements, including any ERCOT
requirements as described therein, in the case of the Freeport Project.

            5.14.3 On or before the date that is 60 days prior to the later to
occur of the anticipated Facility Acceptance Date and the anticipated Project
Commercial Operation Date and thereafter 60 days prior to the beginning of each
subsequent calendar year, each Project Company shall submit an operating plan
and a budget, detailed by month, of anticipated revenues and anticipated
expenditures under all applicable Waterfall Levels, and, with respect to the
budget submitted for MEC, anticipated expenditures from the MEC Major
Maintenance Reserve Account, each such budget to include Debt Service, the
projected Debt Service Coverage Ratio, proposed dividend distributions, Major
Maintenance, reserves and all anticipated O&M Costs (including reasonable
allowance for contingencies) applicable to the applicable Project for the
ensuing calendar year (or, in the case of the initial Annual Operating Budgets,
partial calendar year) and, in the case of Major Maintenance in accordance with
Section 5.14.5, to the conclusion of the second full calendar year thereafter
(each such annual operating plan and budget, including the initial Annual
Operating Budgets, an "Annual Operating Budget"). Each Annual Operating Budget
for each Project shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Administrative
Agent acting in consultation with the Independent Engineer, such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld. Failure by Administrative Agent to approve or
disapprove any such draft Annual Operating Budget within 30 days after receipt
thereof shall be deemed to be an approval by Administrative Agent of such draft
as the final Annual Operating Budget for such Project. Borrower and each Project
Company shall consider in good faith Administrative Agent's suggestions in
preparation of a final Annual Operating Budget for each Project. Borrower shall,
or shall cause each Project Company to, prepare a final Annual Operating Budget
for each Project no less than 30 days in advance of the later to occur of the
anticipated Facility Acceptance Date and the Project Commercial Operation Date,
and each subsequent calendar year. The O&M Costs in each Annual Operating Budget
which are subject to escalation limitations in the Project Documents shall not,
absent extraordinary circumstances, be increased by more than the amounts
provided in such Project Documents.

            5.14.4 Each Project Company shall operate, or cause to be operated,
and maintain its Project, within amounts for (a) any Operating Budget Category
not to exceed 110%

                                       69
<PAGE>

(on a year-to-date basis), and (b) for all Operating Budget Categories not to
exceed 105% (on a year-to-date basis), in each case of the amounts budgeted
therefor as set forth in the then-current Annual Operating Budget for the
applicable Project as approved or deemed approved by Administrative Agent;
provided, however, that (i) subject to Section 6.12, each Project Company may
propose an amendment to the Annual Operating Budget for such Project for
Administrative Agent's approval if at any time either Project Company cannot
comply with clause (a) or (b) above (and Administrative Agent shall consider
each such amendment in good faith and shall not unreasonably withhold its
consent to the approval of any such amendment), and (ii) the 110% limitation
shall not apply to Variable O&M Costs to the extent that such Variable O&M Costs
result from the dispatch of the applicable Project at levels in excess of the
levels contemplated by the then-current Annual Operating Budget for such
Project. Pending approval of any Annual Operating Budget or amendment thereto in
accordance with the terms of this Section 5.14.4, each Project Company shall use
its best efforts to operate and maintain its Project, or cause such Project to
be operated and maintained, within the then-current Annual Operating Budget for
such Project (it being acknowledged that if a particular calendar year's Annual
Operating Budget for such Project has not been approved by the time periods
provided in Section 5.14.3, then the then-current Annual Operating Budget for
such Project shall be deemed to be the Annual Operating Budget in effect for
such Project prior to the delivery of the final Annual Operating Budget for such
Project pursuant to Section 5.14.3); provided that the amounts specified therein
shall be increased or decreased to the extent specified in the MEC O&M/Major
Maintenance Agreement.

            5.14.5 Borrower shall also include in each Annual Operating Budget a
reassessment of (a) the Major Maintenance Reserve Requirement for the Mankato
Project, determined as provided in the definition of "Major Maintenance Reserve
Requirement" in the MEC Depositary Agreement, (b) the anticipated scheduling,
probable cost and a reasonably detailed description of each anticipated item of
Major Maintenance, through the next major turbine overhaul cycle for each
Project (the "Major Maintenance Plan"), and (c) the anticipated amounts which
will be on deposit in the MEC Major Maintenance Reserve Account and FEC Major
Maintenance Reserve Account during each year of the Major Maintenance Plan.
Borrower shall cause each Project Company to cause its Project to perform (or
cause to be performed) all Major Maintenance on its respective Project
substantially in accordance with the then-current Major Maintenance Plan and in
all material respects in accordance with the provisions of the Operative
Documents. The Major Maintenance Plan, including without limitation the
assumptions made in connection with calculating the Mankato Project's Major
Maintenance Reserve Requirement, shall be subject to approval by the
Administrative Agent in consultation with the Independent Engineer, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

      5.15  PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

            5.15.1 Each Project Company shall cause its Project to maintain in
full force and effect, perform (subject to Section 5.2) the obligations of the
applicable Project Company under, preserve, protect and defend the material
rights of such Project Company under and, subject to Section 5.13(b), take all
reasonable action necessary to prevent termination (except by expiration

                                       70
<PAGE>

in accordance with its terms) of each and every Major Project Document,
including (where each such Project Company in the exercise of its business
judgment deems it proper) prosecution of suits to enforce any material right of
such Project Company thereunder and enforcement of any material claims with
respect thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower shall enforce all of
its rights under the Completion Undertaking Agreements and the Undertaking
Support LCs (to the extent the Undertaking Support LCs are held by Borrower) and
the Project Companies shall enforce all of their rights under the Construction
Contract Guaranties.

            5.15.2 From time to time, Borrower shall, and shall cause each
Borrower Party to, execute, acknowledge, record, register, deliver and/or file
all such notices, statements, instruments and other documents (including any
memorandum of lease or other agreement, financing statement, continuation
statement, certificate of title or estoppel certificate), relating to the Loans
stating the interest and charges then due and any known Events of Default or
Inchoate Defaults, and take such other steps as may be necessary or advisable to
render fully valid and enforceable under all applicable laws the rights, liens
and priorities of the Secured Parties with respect to all Collateral and other
security from time to time furnished under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents or intended to be so furnished, in each case in such form and at such
times as shall be reasonably requested by Collateral Agent, and pay all
reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incident to
compliance with this Section 5.15.2.

            5.15.3 If any Borrower Party shall at any time acquire any real
property or leasehold or other interest in real property not covered by the FEC
Deed of Trust or the MEC Mortgage, then promptly upon such acquisition, execute,
deliver and record a supplement to such Deed of Trust, reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to Collateral Agent, subjecting the real property or
leasehold or other interests to the Lien and security interest created by such
Deed of Trust. If reasonably requested by Collateral Agent, such Borrower Party
shall obtain an appropriate endorsement or supplement to, as applicable, the
Title Policy or the Term Title Policy insuring the Lien of the Secured Parties
in such additional property, subject only to Permitted Liens and other
exceptions to title approved by Collateral Agent.

            5.15.4 Upon the request of Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent,
the applicable Borrower Party shall execute and deliver all documents as shall
be necessary or that Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may
be) shall reasonably request in connection with the rights and remedies of
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) and the Lenders
under the Operative Documents, and perform such other reasonable acts as may be
necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents.

            5.15.5 The applicable Borrower Party shall take such action,
including the execution and filing of all such documents and instruments, as may
be necessary to effect and continue the appointment of Corporation Service
Company as its agent for service of process in full force and effect, or if
necessary by reason of any fact or condition relating to such agent, to replace
such agent (but only after having given notice and evidence thereof to
Administrative Agent).

                                       71
<PAGE>

      5.16  ADDITIONAL CONSENTS.

            Upon the reasonable request of Administrative Agent, with respect to
(a) any Major Project Document (including any Additional Project Document)
entered into after the Closing Date and (b) any Major Project Document entered
into by a Replacement Obligor pursuant to Article 7, in each case, the
applicable Project Company shall cause the applicable counterparty or
Replacement Obligor, as applicable, to execute and deliver to Administrative
Agent a Consent in substantially the form of Exhibit E-1, with such changes as
are reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.

      5.17  DRAWSTOP FUNDS.

            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
during any period when Loans are not available to Borrower as a result of a
failure to meet any of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 3 hereof
or Article 3 of the Borrower Depositary Agreement, Sponsor pays Project Costs
through direct or indirect cash equity contributions provided to or on behalf of
Borrower (such amounts used to pay such Project Costs, as certified by the
Independent Engineer and confirmed by Administrative Agent, the "Drawstop
Funds"), then, at such time as such conditions shall be met and Construction
Loans shall become available to Borrower, Borrower shall be entitled to make a
Borrowing of Construction Loans in the amount of the Drawstop Funds, but in no
event in excess of the Available Construction Loan Commitment, and shall be
permitted to reimburse Sponsor for such excess cash equity contributions.

      5.18  MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE.

            Borrower shall cause each Project Company to maintain or cause to be
maintained on its behalf in effect at all times the types of insurance required
pursuant to Exhibit K, in the amounts and on the terms and conditions specified
therein, from the quality of insurers specified in such Exhibit or other
insurance companies of recognized responsibility reasonably satisfactory to
Administrative Agent.

      5.19  TAXES, OTHER GOVERNMENT CHARGES AND UTILITY CHARGES.

            Subject to the second sentence of this Section 5.19 and except for
Permitted Liens, each Borrower Party shall timely file all tax returns and pay,
or cause to be paid, as and when due and prior to delinquency, all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges of any kind that may at any time be
lawfully assessed or levied against or with respect to any Borrower Party or
either Project, including sales and use taxes and real estate taxes, all utility
and other charges incurred in the operation, maintenance, use, occupancy and
upkeep of each Project, and all assessments and charges lawfully made by any
Governmental Authority for public improvements that may be secured by a Lien on
each Project. Borrower Parties may contest in good faith any such taxes,
assessments and other charges and, in such event, may permit the taxes,
assessments or other charges so contested to remain unpaid during any period,
including appeals, when Borrower Parties are in good faith contesting the same,
so long as (a) reserves to the extent required by GAAP have been established in
an amount sufficient to pay any such

                                       72
<PAGE>

taxes, assessments or other charges, accrued interest thereon and potential
penalties or other costs relating thereto, or other adequate provision for the
payment thereof shall have been made and maintained at all times during such
contest, (b) enforcement of the contested tax, assessment or other charge is
effectively stayed for the entire duration of such contest, and (c) any tax,
assessment or other charge determined to be due, together with any interest or
penalties thereon, is promptly paid after resolution of such contest.

      5.20  EVENT OF EMINENT DOMAIN.

            If an Event of Eminent Domain shall occur with respect to any
Collateral, Borrower shall cause each Project Company (in the case of the
Freeport Project, insofar as consistent with Dow's rights under the Dow
Agreements), to (a) diligently pursue all its rights to compensation against the

after the initial Construction Loan, Borrower shall enter into one or more
Interest Rate Agreements with one or more Lenders (or Affiliates thereof) for
the period commencing on the date of such Interest Rate Agreements and ending on
the Term Loan Maturity Date, in a notional amount equal to at least 50% of the
anticipated amount of Loans projected to be outstanding during such period
(which anticipated amount (a) shall be determined by reference to the Base Case
Project Projections, (b) shall take into account any scheduled or projected
repayments or prepayments of Loans contemplated thereunder, and (c) shall
otherwise be determined in consultation with the Administrative Agent). Borrower
shall at all times comply with and maintain in full force and effect through the
end of such period such Interest Rate Agreements.

            5.21.2 Hedge Breaking Fees. To the extent required pursuant to the
terms of the Hedge Transactions, Borrower shall pay all costs, fees and expenses
incurred by Borrower in connection with any unwinding, breach or termination of
such Hedge Transactions ("Hedge Breaking Fees"), all to the extent provided in
and as calculated pursuant to the applicable Interest Rate Agreements.

            5.21.3 Security. Each Interest Rate Agreement provided by a Lender
(or an Affiliate thereof) hereunder, including all Hedge Transactions

<PAGE>

hereby secured by any Collateral Documents, pari passu with the Loans. The
parties hereto agree that, for purposes of any sharing of Collateral under the
Collateral Documents, any Hedge Bank, in its capacity as a counterparty or
intermediary to the Interest Rate Agreements, shall be deemed to have made a
Loan to Borrower in an amount equal to the unpaid amount of any Hedge Breaking
Fees owed by Borrower to such Hedge Bank, under any such Hedge Transaction on
the date that an Early Termination Date (as defined in the applicable Interest
Rate Agreement) occurs. For purposes of any such Collateral sharing such Hedge
Bank shall be deemed a Lender under the Collateral Documents to the extent of
such deemed Loan. For purposes of voting on matters under this Agreement, such
Hedge Bank shall be deemed a Lender and hold votes to the extent specified in
the definition of "Proportionate Share."

      5.22  ADDITIONAL PERMITS.

theretofore disclosed in writing to Administrative Agent), Borrower shall
provide written notice of such Applicable Permit to Administrative Agent.

      5.23  SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY.

            5.23.1 Borrower shall conduct its business solely in its own name
through its duly authorized directors, officers or agents so as not to mislead
others as to the identity of the company with which those others are concerned,
and particularly will avoid the appearance of conducting business on behalf of
any other entity or that its assets or the assets of any other entity are
available to pay the creditors of such other entity. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, all oral and written communications of Borrower,
including, without limitation, letters, invoices, purchase orders, contracts and
statements, will be made solely in the name of Borrower.

            5.23.2 Borrower shall maintain records and books of account separate
from those of all other entities.

            5.23.3 Borrower shall obtain proper authorization from its managers

from its own funds.

            5.23.5 The resolutions, agreements and other instruments underlying

      5.25  CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER DOW AGREEMENTS.

            In the event that the circumstances arise that are described in
Section 5.6 of the FEC Ground Lease, Borrower shall cause FEC to take such
actions, and to fully exercise its rights under such section, as may be
necessary to obtain adequate real estate rights, Permits, and contract rights so
that if Dow were to fail, FEC would have exercised all reasonable efforts toward
being able to operate the Freeport Project independently of Dow.

      5.26  PROJECT REPRESENTATIVE.

            Borrower shall cause each Project Company to designate one or more
individuals who will be responsible for protecting the interests of such Project
Company in all contract discussions and negotiations, with Affiliates of the

owner of the applicable Project.

            MEC and Borrower have advised the Lenders and each of the Lenders
understands and agrees that the waterline path currently proposed for the
Mankato Project may be relocated during the course of development and
construction of the Mankato Project, and, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or the MEC Mortgage to the contrary, the Lenders agree that MEC may,
in accordance with MEC's business judgment, relocate the waterline provided
that, in such event, MEC shall provide the Lenders with a survey of the new
waterline easement(s) that complies with the requirements of Section 3.1.21 and

execute an agreement modifying the MEC Mortgage to extend the lien of the MEC
Mortgage to the new waterline easement(s) and to release the lien of the MEC
Mortgage from the former waterline easement(s).

Administrative Agent's reasonable satisfaction as of the date of any such
disposition with the matters covered by Sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.6(a), 3.1.8

a Project Document requested by a Project Company and approved in writing in
advance of such modification by Administrative Agent acting at the direction of
the Required Lenders, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld),
revoked, canceled or not renewed by the issuing agency or other Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction (or otherwise ceases to be in full force and
effect) and within 30 days thereafter such Project Company is not able to
demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Required Lenders that such
modification of, revocation of, cancellation of, failure to renew, or failure to
maintain in full force and effect such Permit could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            7.1.13 Unenforceability of Credit Documents. At any time after the
execution and delivery thereof, any material provision of any Credit Document
shall cease to be in full force and effect (other than by reason of the
satisfaction in full of the Borrower Parties' Obligations or any other
termination of a Credit Document in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof)
or any Credit Document shall be declared null and void by a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction.

            7.1.14 Misstatements; Omissions. Any representation or warranty made
or deemed made by any Borrower Party in any Credit Document to which such Person
is a party or in any separate statement, certificate or document delivered to
the Lead Arrangers, Administrative Agent, Depositary Agent, Collateral Agent, or
any Lender hereunder or under any other Credit Document to which such Person is
a party, shall be untrue or misleading in any material respect as of the time
made; provided that, in respect of unintentional misrepresentations which are
capable of being remedied and are made or deemed made after the Closing Date,
and the untruth of which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, any such unintentional misrepresentation shall not be deemed to

the occurrence thereof.

            7.1.15 Project Document Defaults.

            (a) Project Companies. Either Project Company shall be in breach of,
or in default of, any material obligation under a Major Project Document and
such breach or default shall reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect and shall not be remediable or, if remediable, shall continue unremedied
for the lesser of (i) a period of 30 days, or (ii) such period of time (without
giving effect to any extension given to Collateral Agent under any applicable
Consent with respect thereto) under such Major Project Document which such
Project Company has available to it in which to remedy such breach or default;
provided that if (A) extending such cure period does not exacerbate such
Material Adverse Effect, (B) such breach cannot be cured within such 30 day
period (or such lesser period of time, as the case may be), (C) such breach is
susceptible of cure within 90 days after such breach or default, (D) such
Project Company is proceeding with diligence and in good faith to cure such
breach, (E) the existence of such breach or default has not had and could not
after considering the nature of the cure, be reasonably expected to give rise to
termination by the counterparty to the Major Project Document which is subject
to breach or to otherwise have exacerbated the Material Adverse Effect, and (F)
Administrative Agent shall have received an officer's certificate signed by a
Responsible Officer to the effect of clauses (A)-(E) above and stating what
action such Project Company is taking to cure such breach, then such 30 day cure
period (or such lesser period of time, as the case may be) shall be extended to
such date, not to exceed a total of 90 days, as shall be necessary for such
Project Company diligently to cure such breach.

            (b) Third Party. Any Person other than either Project Company shall
be in breach of, or in default under, a Major Project Document and such breach
or default shall reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(i) shall not be remediable or (ii) if remediable, shall continue unremedied for
a period of 30 days from the time a Project Company obtains knowledge of such
breach or default; provided that if (A) such breach cannot be cured within such
30 day period, (B) such breach or default is susceptible of cure within 90 days,
(C) the breaching Person or the applicable Project Company is proceeding with
diligence and in good faith to cure such breach, and (D) extending the cure
period would not exacerbate the Material Adverse Effect, then such 30 day cure
period shall be extended to such date, not to exceed a total of 90 days, as
shall be necessary for such breaching Person diligently to cure such breach;
provided, further, that no Event of Default shall occur as a result of any such
action if such Project Company obtains a Replacement Obligor for the affected
party within the 90 day cure period referred to in this paragraph (or within the
30 day cure period, if no extension is given); provided, further, that no
Inchoate Default or Event of Default shall occur as a result of an "Event of
Default" under Section 16.2.2(a) of the MEC Construction Contract (relating to
"inadequate progress") unless the MEC Construction Contract is terminated as a
result thereof; and provided, further, in the case of any default or event of
default under any Major Project Document which is the basis for the making of a
drawing under either Contractor Undertaking LC pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i)(C)
or 2.2(c)(ii) of either Completion Undertaking Agreement (or application of
proceeds of any Contractor Undertaking LC under similar circumstances as
provided in Section 2.3 of either Completion Undertaking Agreement), such
default or event of default under such Major Project Document shall be

                                       93
<PAGE>

deemed cured and any related Inchoate Default or Event of Default hereunder
shall no longer exist following such drawing or application of funds.

            (c) Third Party Consents. (i) Any Person other than any Borrower
Party shall disaffirm or repudiate in writing its material obligations under any
Consent, (ii) any representation or warranty made in any Consent by Dow, NSP,
CCMCI, Operator or Sponsor (for so long as CCMCI's obligations under the
Construction Contracts remain outstanding) shall be untrue or misleading in any
material respect as of the time made and such untrue or misleading
representation or warranty could reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect the rights of the Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties thereunder or
to otherwise result in a Material Adverse Change, or (iii) Dow, NSP, CES, CCMCI,
Operator or Sponsor (for so long as CCMCI's obligations under the Construction
Contracts remain outstanding) shall breach any material covenant in a Consent
and such breach or default shall not be remediable or, if remediable, shall
continue unremedied for a period of 30 days from the time of such breach or
default; provided that if (A) such breach cannot be cured within such 30 day
period, (B) such breach is susceptible of cure within 90 days, (C) the breaching
party is proceeding with diligence and in good faith to cure such breach, and
(D) the existence of such breach has not had and could not after considering the
nature of the cure, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
then such 30 day cure period shall be extended to such date, not to exceed a
total of 90 days, as shall be necessary for such third party diligently to cure
such breach; provided, further, that no Event of Default shall occur as a result
of any such action if (1) the applicable Project Company obtains a Replacement
Obligor for the affected party with respect to the contract or contracts to
which such Consent relates, and (2) such Replacement Obligor executes a Consent
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent, each within the 90 day cure
period referred to in this paragraph (or within the 30 day cure period, if no
extension is given) and such action does not have prior to so obtaining such
Replacement Obligor a Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) Termination. Any material provision in any Major Project
Document shall for any reason cease to be valid and binding on any party thereto
(other than any Borrower Party) except upon fulfillment of such party's
obligations thereunder, or shall be declared null and void; provided that no
Event of Default shall occur as a result of such breach or default if (i) such
provision is restored or replaced by a replacement provision in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent within a period of 90
days thereafter, or (ii) such applicable Borrower Party obtains a Replacement
Obligor for the affected party within 90 days thereafter and, in either case,
such breach or default has not had and does not have prior to so obtaining such
replacement provision or Replacement Obligor, a Material Adverse Effect.

            7.1.16 Power Purchase Agreement and Capacity Sales Agreement. (a)
NSP shall have exercised its "step-in" rights pursuant to Section 12.7 of the
Power Purchase Agreement, (b) Sponsor shall reject or disavow its obligations
under the guaranty portion of the Security Fund, and (c) (i) any valid draw or
claim on the guaranty portion of the Security Fund by NSP pursuant to Section
12.7 of the Power Purchase Agreement shall fail to be timely honored in full,
and (ii) in the event that the Security Fund LC is increased as required under
Section 11.1(E) of the Power Purchase Agreement and contemplated by Section
2.2.4, Borrower

                                       94
<PAGE>

has not provided cash collateral in the amount of any such increase. For
purposes of the previous sentence, "cash collateral" includes amounts in the
Borrower Revenue Account prior to Term-Conversion.

            7.1.17 MEC Facility Acceptance. The Facility Acceptance Date is not
achieved by three months after the Facility Acceptance Milestone, as such date
may have been extended for force majeure or other reason under the Power
Purchase Agreement.

            7.1.18 FEC Commercial Operation. Commercial Operation is not
achieved or deemed achieved by three months after the date of the FEC Milestone
for achieving Commercial Operation of the FEC Phase 3 Work for the Freeport
Project, as such date may have been extended for force majeure or other reason
under the Capacity Sales Agreement.

            7.1.19 Guaranties. The Borrower Party party thereto shall fail to
perform any of its material obligations under Section 2 of each of the MEC
Guaranties, the FEC Guaranty, the FEC-GP Guaranty or the FEC-LP Guaranty.

            7.1.20 Shortfall of Proceeds of Purchase Option or Put Option. As
further described in Section 3.6 of the Borrower Depositary Agreement, the
proceeds of the Purchase Option or Put Option, when applied (together with any
other amounts made available to prepay the FEC Allocated Portion, any amounts
then on deposit in the Accounts established under the FEC Depositary Agreement
and an amount equal to the FEC Allocated Portion Percentage of any amounts then
on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account) to prepay Term Loans, are
insufficient to reduce the outstanding principal of Term Loans by the amount of
the FEC Allocated Portion.

      7.2   REMEDIES.

            Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, and the Lenders may, at the
election of the Majority Lenders, without further notice of default, presentment
or demand for payment, protest or notice of non-payment or dishonor, or other
notices or demands of any kind, all such notices and demands (other than notices
expressly required by the Credit Documents) being waived, exercise any or all of
the following rights and remedies, in any combination or order that the Majority
Lenders may elect, in addition to such other rights or remedies as the Secured
Parties may have hereunder, under the Collateral Documents or at law or in
equity:

            7.2.1 No Further Loans or Letter of Credit. Cancel all Commitments,
refuse, and Administrative Agent, LC Issuer and the Lenders shall not be
obligated, to continue any Loans, make any additional Loans (other than Security
Fund LC Loans), issue, renew, or extend the Security Fund LC, or make any
payments, or permit the making of payments, from any Account or any Loan
proceeds or other funds held by Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under
the Credit Documents or on behalf of Borrower; provided that in the case of an
Event of Default occurring under Section 7.1.2 with respect to Borrower, all
such Commitments shall be cancelled and terminated without further act of
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, or any Secured Party.

                                       95
<PAGE>

            7.2.2 Cure by Agents. Without any obligation to do so, make
disbursements or Loans to or on behalf of Borrower or disburse amounts from the
Construction Account to cure (a) any Event of Default or Inchoate Default
hereunder, and (b) any default and render any performance under any Project
Document as the Majority Lenders in their sole discretion may consider necessary
or appropriate, whether to preserve and protect the Collateral or the Secured
Parties' interests therein or for any other reason. All sums so expended,
together with interest on such total amount at the Default Rate (but in no event
shall the rate exceed the maximum lawful rate), shall be repaid by Borrower to
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, on demand and
shall be secured by the Credit Documents, notwithstanding that such expenditures
may, together with amounts advanced under this Agreement, exceed the aggregate
amount of the Total Construction Loan Commitment.

            7.2.3 Acceleration. Declare and make all or a portion of the sums of
accrued and outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest remaining
under this Agreement, together with all unpaid fees, costs (including
Liquidation Costs and Hedge Breaking Fees) and charges due hereunder or under
any other Credit Document, immediately due and payable and require Borrower
immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which Borrower hereby expressly waives, to pay Administrative Agent or
the Secured Parties an amount in immediately available funds equal to the
aggregate amount of any outstanding Obligations of Borrower; provided that, in
the event of an Event of Default occurring under Section 7.1.2 with respect to
Borrower, all such amounts shall become immediately due and payable without
further act of Administrative Agent, LC Issuer, Collateral Agent, or the Secured
Parties.

            7.2.4 Cash Collateral; Letters of Credit. Apply or execute upon any
amounts on deposit in any Account, other than the Construction Sub-Account under
the MEC Depositary Agreement or the Third Step Construction Sub-Account under
the FEC Depositary Agreement, or any proceeds or any other moneys of Borrower on
deposit with Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent or any
Secured Party in the manner provided in the UCC and other relevant statutes and
decisions and interpretations thereunder with respect to cash collateral; or
draw upon any Collateral Replacement LC held by Collateral Agent as security.
Without limiting the foregoing, each of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent
and Depositary Agent shall have all rights and powers with respect to the Loan
proceeds, draws upon any Collateral Replacement LC, the Accounts and the
contents of the Accounts as it has with respect to any other Collateral and may
apply, or cause the application of, such amounts to the payment of interest,
principal, fees, costs, charges or other amounts due or payable to
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Depositary Agent or the Secured Parties
with respect to the Loans in such order as the Majority Lenders may elect in
their sole discretion. Borrower shall not have any rights or powers with respect
to such amounts.

            7.2.5 Possession of Projects. Enter into possession of either or
both Projects and perform any and all work and labor necessary to complete the
Projects substantially according to the Plans and Specifications or to operate
and maintain the Projects, and all sums expended by Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent or Depositary Agent in so doing, together with interest on such
total amount at the Default Rate, shall be repaid by Borrower to Administrative
Agent,

                                       96
<PAGE>

Collateral Agent or Depositary Agent, as the case may be, upon demand and shall
be secured by the Credit Documents, notwithstanding that such expenditures may,
together with amounts advanced under this Agreement, exceed the aggregate amount
of the Total Construction Loan Commitment.

            7.2.6 Remedies Under Credit Documents. Exercise, and direct
Administrative Agent, Depositary Agent, or Collateral Agent (as the case may be)
to exercise, any and all rights and remedies available to it under any of the
Credit Documents, including judicial or non-judicial foreclosure or public or
private sale of any of the Collateral pursuant to the Collateral Documents.
Furthermore, if Administrative Agent requests that certain actions be taken and
a Project Company fails to take the requested actions within five Banking Days,
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as applicable) may enforce in its own
name or in such Project Company's name, such rights of the Project Company, all
as more particularly provided in the Security Agreement and the other Credit
Documents.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                               SCOPE OF LIABILITY

            Except as set forth in this Article 8, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement or the other Credit Documents to the contrary, the Lenders, the
Hedge Banks and the LC Issuer shall have no claims with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents against Sponsor or any of
its Affiliates (other than Borrower Parties), shareholders, officers, directors
or employees (collectively, the "Nonrecourse Persons") and the Lenders', the
Hedge Banks' and the LC Issuer's recourse against Borrower Parties and the
Nonrecourse Persons shall be limited to the Collateral, the Projects, all
Project Revenues, all Loan proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, Eminent Domain
Proceeds, and all income or revenues of the foregoing as and to the extent
provided herein and in the Collateral Documents; provided that the foregoing
provision of this Article 8 shall not (a) constitute a waiver, release or
discharge of any of the indebtedness, or of any of the terms, covenants,
conditions, or provisions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document and the
same shall continue (but without personal liability to the Nonrecourse Persons)
until fully paid, discharged, observed, or performed, (b) limit or restrict the
right of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or any Secured Party (or any
assignee, beneficiary or successor to any of them) to name any Borrower Party or
any other Person as a defendant in any action or suit for a judicial foreclosure
or for the exercise of any other remedy under or with respect to this Agreement
or any other Collateral Document or Credit Document, or for injunction or
specific performance, so long as no judgment in the nature of a deficiency
judgment shall be enforced against any Nonrecourse Person, except as set forth
in this Article 8, (c) in any way limit or restrict any right or remedy of
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or any Secured Party (or any assignee or
beneficiary thereof or successor thereto) with respect to, and each of the
Nonrecourse Persons shall remain fully liable to the extent that it would
otherwise be liable for its own actions with respect to, any fraud, willful
misrepresentation (which shall not include innocent or negligent
misrepresentation), or misappropriation of Project Revenues, Loan proceeds,
Insurance Proceeds, Eminent Domain Proceeds or any other earnings, revenues,
rents, issues, profits or proceeds from or of the Collateral, that should or
would have been paid as provided herein or paid or delivered to Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent or

                                       97

any Secured Party (or any assignee or beneficiary thereof or successor thereto)
towards any payment required under this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
(d) affect or diminish or constitute a waiver, release or discharge of any
specific written obligation, covenant, or agreement in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents made by any of the
Nonrecourse Persons or any security granted by the Nonrecourse Persons in
support of the obligations of such Persons under any Collateral Document or
Project Document (or as security for the obligations of Borrower Parties), or
the Group Pledge and Security Agreement, or (e) limit the liability of (i) any
Person who is a party to any Project Document or has issued any certificate or
other statement in connection therewith with respect to such liability as may
arise by reason of the terms and conditions of such Project Document (but
subject to any limitation of liability in such Project Document), certificate or
statement, or (ii) any Person rendering a legal opinion pursuant to this
Agreement (including Section 3.1.8, 3.2.11, 3.3.8 or 7.1.11), in each case under
this clause (e) relating solely to such liability of such Person as may arise
under such referenced agreement, instrument or opinion. The limitations on
recourse set forth in this Article 8 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, the termination of all Commitments and the Interest Rate Agreements
to which any Secured Party is a party and the indefeasible payment in full in
cash and performance in full of the Borrower's Obligations hereunder and under
the other Operative Documents.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                              AGENTS; SUBSTITUTION

      9.1   APPOINTMENT, POWERS AND IMMUNITIES.

            9.1.1 Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes (a) Administrative
Agent to act as its agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and
(b) Collateral Agent to act as its collateral agent hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents, in each case with such powers as are expressly delegated
to Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) by the terms of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Neither Administrative Agent nor
Collateral Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities except those
expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document, or be a
trustee or a fiduciary for any Secured Party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, neither Administrative Agent nor Collateral Agent
shall be required to take any action which is contrary to this Agreement or any
other Credit Documents or any Legal Requirement or exposes Administrative Agent
or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) to any liability. Each of the Lead
Arrangers, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any of their
respective Affiliates shall not be responsible to any other Secured Party for
(i) any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by each
Borrower Party or its Affiliates contained in this Agreement, the other Credit
Documents or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Lead Arrangers, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent,
or any Secured Party under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, any

                                       98
<PAGE>

Notes or any other document referred to or provided for herein, or (iii) any
failure by any Borrower Party or its Affiliates to perform their respective
obligations hereunder or thereunder. Each of Administrative Agent and Collateral
Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact, and neither shall be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

            9.1.2 None of Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, the Lead
Arrangers and their respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be
responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith,
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) Administrative Agent may treat the
payee of any Note as the holder thereof until Administrative Agent receives
written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in
form satisfactory to Administrative Agent, (b) each of Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith by them in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts, (c) none of Collateral Agent, Administrative
Agent and the Lead Arrangers makes any warranty or representation to any Secured
Party for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection
with any Operative Document, (d) none of Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent
and the Lead Arrangers shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any
Operative Document on the part of any party thereto, to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of any Borrower Party or any other Person or
to ascertain or determine whether a Material Adverse Effect exists or is
continuing, and (e) none of Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arrangers shall be responsible to any Secured Party for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any
Operative Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto. Except as otherwise provided under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall take such
action with respect to the Credit Documents as shall be directed by the Majority
Lenders or, if expressly so provided, the Required Lenders.

            9.1.3 None of the Co-Syndication Agents, Underwriters,
Co-Documentation Agents and Co-Book Runners shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement, other than
those applicable to all Secured Parties and those set forth in Section 5.11 and
this Article 9. The Lead Arrangers shall only have those rights, powers,
obligations, liabilities, responsibilities and duties set forth in Section 3.1,
Section 5.11, this Article 9 and Section 11.1. Without limiting the foregoing,
none of the Lead Arrangers, Underwriters, Co-Syndication Agents,
Co-Documentation Agents and Co-Book Runners shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Secured Party. Each Secured Party hereby makes
the same acknowledgments with respect to the Lead Arrangers, Underwriters,
Co-Syndication Agents, Co-Documentation Agents and Co-Book Runners as it makes
with respect to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in this Article
9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that the
Co-Syndication Agents, Underwriters, Co-Documentation Agents and Co-Book Runners
hold such titles in name only, and that such

                                       99
<PAGE>

titles confer no additional rights or obligations relative to those conferred on
any Secured Party hereunder.

      9.2   RELIANCE.

            Each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any certificate, notice or other document (including any cable,
telegram, facsimile, electronic mail or telex) believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or
Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants and other experts selected by it. As to any other matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement, neither Collateral Agent nor
Administrative Agent shall be required to take any action or exercise any
discretion, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting upon
instructions of the Majority Lenders or, where expressly provided, the Required
Lenders or all Lenders (except that neither Collateral Agent nor Administrative
Agent shall be required to take any action which exposes Collateral Agent or
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) to personal liability or which is
contrary to this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any Legal Requirement).
Each of Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent shall in all cases (including
when any action by Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
alone is authorized hereunder, if Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) elects in its sole discretion to obtain instructions from the
Majority Lenders) be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder or under any other Credit Document in accordance with the instructions
of the Majority Lenders (or, where so expressly stated, the Required Lenders or
all Lenders), and such instructions of the Majority Lenders (or Required Lenders
or all Lenders, where applicable) and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Secured Parties.

      9.3   NON-RELIANCE.

            Each Lender represents that it has, independently and without
reliance on the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of the financial condition and affairs of
the Calpine Entities and its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Lead Arrangers,
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement. Each of Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent
and any Lender shall not be required to keep informed as to the performance or
observance by any Calpine Entity or its Affiliates under this Agreement or any
other document referred to or provided for herein or to make inquiry of, or to
inspect the properties or books of any Calpine Entity or its Affiliates.

      9.4   DEFAULTS; MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.

            None of the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent and Administrative
Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any
Inchoate Default, Event of

                                      100
<PAGE>

Default or Material Adverse Change, unless such Person has received a notice
from a Lender or any Borrower Party, referring to this Agreement, describing
such Inchoate Default, Event of Default or Material Adverse Change and
indicating that such notice is a notice of the occurrence of such default or
Material Adverse Change (as the case may be). If Administrative Agent receives
such a notice of the occurrence of an Inchoate Default, Event of Default or
Material Adverse Change, Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the
Lenders. Each of Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Inchoate Default, Event of Default or Material
Adverse Change as is provided in Article 3, Article 7 or the terms of the Credit
Documents, or if not provided for in Article 3, Article 7 or such Credit
Documents, as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall be reasonably
directed by the Majority Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall have received such directions,
each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Inchoate Default, Event of Default or Material Adverse Change as it
shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

      9.5   INDEMNIFICATION.

            Without limiting the Obligations of each Borrower Party hereunder,
each Lender agrees to indemnify the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent and
Administrative Agent and their respective officers, directors, shareholders,
controlling Persons, employees, agents and servants, ratably in accordance with
their Proportionate Shares for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, Collateral
Agent or such Person in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents (to the extent Borrower
has not paid any such amounts pursuant to Section 5.11); provided, however, that
no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from
Administrative Agent's, the Lead Arrangers', Collateral Agent's or any such
Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Administrative Agent or any
such Person shall be fully justified in refusing to take or to continue to take
any action hereunder or under any other Credit Document unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent or any such
Person promptly upon demand for its Proportionate Share of any out-of-pocket
expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by Administrative Agent, the Lead
Arrangers, Collateral Agent or any such Person in connection with the
preparation, execution, administration or enforcement of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Operative Documents, to the
extent that Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent or any
such Person is not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrower.

      9.6   SUCCESSOR AGENT.

                                      101
<PAGE>

            Each of Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by giving 15 days' written notice thereof to the Secured Parties and
Borrower. Each of Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent may be removed
involuntarily only for a material breach of its respective duties and
obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents or for gross
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the performance of its
respective duties hereunder or under the other Credit Documents and then only
upon the affirmative vote of the Required Lenders (excluding Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent (as the case may be) from such vote and
Administrative Agent's and Collateral Agent's (as the case may be) Proportionate
Share (if any) of the Commitments from the amounts used to determine the portion
of the Commitments necessary to constitute the required Proportionate Share of
the remaining Lenders). Upon any such resignation or removal of either
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the
right, with the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be). If no successor Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be) shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's or Collateral Agent's (as the case may be) giving of
notice of resignation or the Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be), the retiring Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent (as the case may be) may, on behalf of the Secured
Parties, with the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be) hereunder, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender
shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be)
under the Operative Documents by a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be), such successor Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent (as the case may be) shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent
or Collateral Agent (as the case may be), and the retiring Administrative Agent
or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be)
only under the Credit Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's or
Collateral Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent (as the case may be), the provisions of this Article 9 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case may be) under the
Operative Documents.

      9.7   AUTHORIZATION.

            Each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent is hereby
authorized by the Secured Parties to execute, deliver and perform each of the
Credit Documents to which Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as the case
may be) is or is intended to be a party, and each Lender agrees to be bound by
all of the agreements of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent contained in
the Credit Documents. Each of Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent is
further authorized by the Secured Parties to release Liens on property that
Borrower is permitted to sell or transfer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or the other Credit Documents and to

                                      102
<PAGE>

enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of curing any formal
defect, inconsistency, omission or ambiguity in this Agreement or any Credit
Document to which it is a party.

      9.8   OTHER ROLES.

            With respect to its Commitment, the Loans made by it and any Note
issued to it, each of the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent
and LC Issuer in its individual capacity shall have the same rights and powers
under the Operative Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not a Lead Arranger, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or LC
Issuer. The term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include each of the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent, Administrative
Agent and LC Issuer in its individual capacity. Each of the Lead Arrangers,
Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, LC Issuer and their respective
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower
Party or any other Person, without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
For the avoidance of doubt Collateral Agent may act as Depositary Agent
notwithstanding any potential or actual conflict of interest presented by the
foregoing and any Borrower Party. Each of the Lenders hereby waives any claim
against each of the Lead Arrangers, Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent, LC
Issuer and any of their respective Affiliates based upon any conflict of
interest that such Person may have with regard to acting as an agent, arranger
or issuing bank hereunder and acting in such other roles.

      9.9   AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS.

            Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.9, unless otherwise
specified in this Agreement or another Credit Document, the Majority Lenders (or
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent upon written direction or consent of
the Majority Lenders) and any Borrower Party may enter into agreements, waivers
or supplements hereto for the purpose of adding, modifying or waiving any
provisions to the Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the
Lenders or any Borrower Party hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Inchoate
Default or Event of Default; provided, however, that no such supplemental
agreement shall, without the consent of all of the Lenders:

            (a) increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder;
or

            (b) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of "Majority
Lenders" or "Required Lenders"; or

            (c) amend this Section 9.9; or

            (d) release any Collateral (other than immaterial portions thereof
or as expressly permitted pursuant to the Credit Documents) from the Lien of any
of the Collateral Documents; or

                                      103
<PAGE>

            (e) extend the Construction Loan Maturity Date or the Term Loan
Maturity Date or reduce the principal amount of any outstanding Loans or Notes
or reduce the rate or change the time of payment of interest due on any Loan;
provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to
amend the definition of "Default Rate" contained in Section 2.6.3 or to waive
any obligation of Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate; or

            (f) reduce the amount or extend the payment date for any amount due,
whether principal or interest; or

            (g) subordinate the Loans to any other Debt.

            No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement affecting the rights or obligations of Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, LC Issuer or the Lead Arrangers shall be effective without the
written consent of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, LC Issuer or the Lead
Arrangers, as the case may be.

      9.10  WITHHOLDING TAX.

            If the forms or other documentation required by Section 2.6.6 are
not delivered to Administrative Agent, then Administrative Agent may withhold
from any interest payment to any Lender not providing such forms or other
documentation, an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

            9.10.1 If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the
United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Administrative Agent
did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any
Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly
executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Administrative Agent of a
change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason), then such Lender shall
indemnify Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or
indirectly, by Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and
interest, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses,
allocated staff costs, and any out of pocket expenses. Borrower shall not be
responsible for any amounts paid or required to be paid by a Lender under this
Section 9.10.1.

            9.10.2 If any Lender sells, assigns, grants participation in, or
otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement, the purchaser, assignee,
participant or transferee, as applicable, shall comply and be bound by the terms
of Section 2.6.6 and this Section 9.10 as though it were such Lender.

      9.11  GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO PAYMENTS.

            Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender,
subject to the terms of any separate agreement between Administrative Agent and
such Lender, its pro rata share of each payment of principal and interest
payable to the Lenders on the Loans and of fees hereunder received by
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders and of any other

                                      104
<PAGE>

amounts owing under the Loans. The payments made for the account of each Lender
shall be made, and distributed to it, for the account of (a) its domestic
lending office in the case of payments of principal of, and interest on, its
Base Rate Loans, (b) its domestic or foreign lending office, as each Lender may
designate in writing to Administrative Agent, in the case of LIBOR Loans, and
(c) its domestic lending office, or such other lending office as it may
designate for the purpose from time to time, in the case of payments of fees and
other amounts payable hereunder. Lenders shall have the right to alter
designated lending offices upon five Banking Days prior written notice to
Administrative Agent and Borrower.

      9.12  SUBSTITUTION OF LENDER.

            Should any Lender fail to make a Loan in violation of its
obligations under this Agreement (a "Non-Advancing Bank"), Administrative Agent
shall (a) in its sole discretion fund the Loan on behalf of the Non-Advancing
Bank, or (b) cooperate and consult with Borrower or any other Lender to find
another Person that shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent and that shall
be willing to assume the Non-Advancing Bank's obligations under this Agreement
(including the obligation to make the Loan which the Non-Advancing Bank failed
to make but without assuming any liability for damages for failing to have made
such Loan or any previously required Loan). Subject to the provisions of the
next following sentence, such Person shall be substituted for the Non-Advancing
Bank hereunder upon execution and delivery to Administrative Agent of an
agreement acceptable to Administrative Agent by such Person assuming the
Non-Advancing Bank's obligations (including its Commitments) under this
Agreement, and all interest and fees which would otherwise have been payable to
the Non-Advancing Bank shall thereafter be payable to such Person. Nothing in
(and no action taken pursuant to) this Section 9.12 shall relieve the
Non-Advancing Bank from any liability it might have to Borrower or to the other
Lenders as a result of its failure to make any Loan.

      9.13  PARTICIPATION.

            9.13.1 Sales of Participation. Nothing herein provided shall prevent
any Lender from selling a participation in one or more of its Commitments (or
Loans made hereunder); provided that (a) no such sale of a participation shall
alter such Lender's or Borrower's obligations hereunder, and (b) any agreement
pursuant to which any Lender may grant a participation in its rights with
respect to its Commitment (or Loans made hereunder) shall provide that, with
respect to such Commitment (or Loans made hereunder), subject to the following
proviso, such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to exercise
the rights of such Lender, and enforce the obligations of Borrower relating to
such Commitment (or Loans made hereunder), including the right to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document and the right to take action to have the Obligations
hereunder (or any portion thereof) declared due and payable pursuant to Article
7; provided, however, that such agreement may provide that the participant may
have rights to approve or disapprove decreases in Commitments, interest rates or
fees, lengthening of maturity of any Loans, extend the payment date for any
amount due under Article 2 or release of

                                      105
<PAGE>

any material Collateral. No recipient of a participation in any Commitment or
Loans of any Lender shall have any rights under this Agreement or shall be
entitled to any reimbursement for Taxes, Other Taxes, increased costs or reserve
requirements under Section 2.6 or 2.8 or any other indemnity or payment rights
against Borrower (but shall be permitted to receive from the Lender granting
such participation a proportionate amount which would have been payable to the
Lender from whom such Person acquired its participation).

            9.13.2 Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a
special purpose funding vehicle (a "SPC"), identified as such in writing from
time to time by the Granting Bank to Administrative Agent and Borrower, the
option to provide to Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting
Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that (a) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any
SPC to make any Loan, and (b) if a SPC elects not to exercise such option or
otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall
be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a
Loan by a SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the
same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain
with the Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it
will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against,
such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings under the laws of the United States or any state thereof. In
addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
9.13, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of,
Borrower, Administrative Agent or and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting
Bank or to any financial institutions (consented to by Borrower and
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity or credit support to or for the
account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans, and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This Section 9.13.2
may not be amended without the written consent of all SPCs having outstanding
Loans or Commitments hereunder.

      9.14  TRANSFER OF COMMITMENT.

            Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary (but subject to
Section 9.13.2), any Lender, after receiving Administrative Agent's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and (so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), after consulting with
Borrower as to the identity of the applicable assignee, may from time to time,
at its option, sell, assign, transfer, negotiate or otherwise dispose of a
portion of one or more of its Commitments (including, for purposes of this
Section 9.14, Loans made hereunder) (including the Lender's interest in this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents) to any Lender; provided, however, that
no Lender (including any assignee of any Lender) may

                                      106
<PAGE>

assign any portion of its Commitment (including Loans) (a) in an amount less
than $5,000,000 (unless to another Lender), or (b) in an amount which leaves the
assigning Lender with a Commitment (including Loans) of less than $5,000,000 (in
each case based on the original principal amount of the Commitment assigned)
after giving effect to such assignment and all previous assignments (except that
a Lender may be left with no Commitment or Loans if it assigns its entire
Commitment); and provided, further, that any Lender may assign all or any
portion of its Commitments to an Affiliate of such Lender without the consent of
any Person. In the event of any such assignment, (i) the assigning Lender's
Proportionate Share shall be reduced and its obligations hereunder released by
the amount of the Proportionate Share assigned to the new Lender, (ii) the
parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver an appropriate agreement
evidencing such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Borrower, (iii)
the parties to the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, excluding
Borrower, shall collectively pay to Administrative Agent an administrative fee
of $3,500, (iv) at the assigning Lender's option, Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such new Notes in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit
B-2, as requested, in a principal amount equal to such new Lender's Commitment,
but only if it shall also be executing and exchanging with the assigning Lender
a replacement note for any Note in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by
the assigning Lender, if any; provided that Borrower shall have received for
cancellation the existing Note held by such assigning Lender, and (v)
Administrative Agent shall amend Exhibit H to reflect the Proportionate Shares
of the Lenders following such assignment. Thereafter, such new Lender shall be
deemed to be a Lender and shall have all of the rights and duties of a Lender
(except as otherwise provided in this Article 9), in accordance with its
Proportionate Share, under each of the Credit Documents.

      9.15  LAWS.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 9, no sale,
assignment, transfer, negotiation or other disposition of the interests of any
Lender hereunder or under the other Credit Documents shall be allowed if it
would require registration under the federal Securities Act of 1933, as then
amended, any other federal securities laws or regulations or the securities laws
or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. Borrower shall, from time to time
at the request and expense of Administrative Agent, execute and deliver to
Administrative Agent, or to such party or parties as Administrative Agent may
designate, any and all further instruments as may in the opinion of
Administrative Agent be reasonably necessary or advisable to give full force and
effect to such sale, assignment, transfer, negotiation or disposition which
would not require any such registration.

      9.16  ASSIGNABILITY AS COLLATERAL.

            Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement or
any other Credit Document to the contrary, any Lender may assign all or any
portion of the Loans or Notes held by it to the Federal Reserve Bank and the
United States Treasury as collateral security; provided that any payment in
respect of such assigned Loans or Notes made by Borrower to or for the account
of the assigning or pledging Lender in accordance with the terms of this

                                      107
<PAGE>

Agreement shall satisfy Borrower's obligations hereunder in respect of such
assigned Loans or Notes to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall
release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

      9.17  NOTICES TO LENDERS.

            The Administrative Agent promptly shall deliver all material
documents, instruments and notices that it receives hereunder and under the
other Operative Documents to each Lender. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or the other Credit Documents, the Borrower shall not be required to
deliver any documents, instruments or notices directly to the Lenders.

      9.18  COLLATERAL AGENT.

            The Collateral Agent shall:

            9.18.1 forward promptly to Administrative Agent any notice delivered
to the Collateral Agent pursuant to any Consent;

            9.18.2 have the right, but not the obligation, to (a) refuse any
item for credit to any Account except as required by the terms of the Credit
Documents, (b) refuse to honor any request for transfer in relation to any
Account that is not consistent with the Credit Documents, (c) charge to any
Account all applicable charges related to maintaining such Accounts, and (d) pay
fees, interest and other charges owing by Borrower as provided herein and in the
other Operative Documents;

            9.18.3 except as otherwise provided herein and in the Depositary
Agreements (including by the provision of standing instructions therein), take
all actions and make all determinations with respect to the Collateral, the
Security Documents (including as to the advisability of taking additional steps
to perfect, or cause the perfection of, any security interest) and the other
Credit Documents to which it is a party as directed in writing by Administrative
Agent (acting in accordance with Section 9.9); and

            9.18.4 have the right at any time to seek clarification and
instructions concerning the administration of the Credit Documents from
Administrative Agent, legal counsel selected by it in good faith with reasonable
care or any court of competent jurisdiction and shall be fully protected in
relying upon such instructions.

                             INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS

      10.1  REMOVAL AND FEES.

            Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, may remove from
time to time, any one or more of the Independent Consultants and, after
consulting with Borrower as to an appropriate Person, appoint replacements as
Administrative Agent may choose. Notice of any

                                      108
<PAGE>

replacement Independent Consultant shall be given by Administrative Agent to
Borrower, the Lenders and to the Independent Consultant being replaced. All
reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Consultants (whether the
original ones or replacements) shall be paid by Borrower pursuant to agreements
reasonably acceptable to Borrower; provided that no such acceptance shall be
required at any time an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

      10.2  DUTIES.

            Each Independent Consultant shall be contractually obligated to (a)
on or before the Closing Date, the Lead Arrangers, and (b) thereafter,
Administrative Agent to carry out the activities required of it in this
Agreement and as otherwise requested by the Lead Arrangers or Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) and shall be responsible solely to the Lead Arrangers
or Administrative Agent (as the case may be). Borrower acknowledges that it will
not have any cause of action or claim against any Independent Consultant
resulting from any decision made or not made, any action taken or not taken or
any advice given by such Independent Consultant in the due performance in good
faith of its duties to the Lead Arrangers or Administrative Agent (as the case
may be), except to the extent arising from such Independent Consultant's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

      10.3  INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS' CERTIFICATES.

            (a) Until the receipt by Administrative Agent of certificates
satisfactory to Administrative Agent from each Independent Consultant whom
Administrative Agent considers necessary or appropriate certifying Completion of
a Project or Final Completion, Borrower shall provide such documents and
information to the Independent Consultants as any of the Independent Consultants
may reasonably consider necessary in order for the Independent Consultants to
deliver to Administrative Agent the following:

                  (i) certificates of the Insurance Consultant, Independent
Engineer and Power Market Consultant delivered on and dated as of the Closing
Date as described in Sections 3.1.9, 3.1.11 and 3.1.12, respectively, and
containing the matters set out therein;

                  (ii) after the Closing Date, all certificates to be delivered

                  (iii) monthly after the Closing Date, a full report and status
of the progress of each Project to that date, a complete assessment of Project
Costs to Final Completion and such other information and certification as
Administrative Agent may reasonably require from the Independent Engineer from

reasonably consider necessary in order for the Independent Consultants to
deliver annually to Administrative Agent

                                      109

other information and certification as Administrative Agent may reasonably
require from time to time.

remedy of the Secured Parties, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any

therein, or of or in any similar breach or default or unsatisfied condition
precedent thereafter occurring, nor shall any waiver of any single Event of
Default, Inchoate Default, Material Adverse Change or other breach or default or
unsatisfied condition precedent be deemed a waiver of any other Event of

unsatisfied condition precedent theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver,
permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties of any Event of

declaratory relief in any way related to this Agreement or in collecting any sum
which becomes due on the Notes or under the Credit Documents and (b)
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, and the Lenders for their reasonable

Reference is hereby made to the FEC Deed of Trust and the MEC Mortgage and the

obligations of Borrower and the rights of Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent
and the other Secured Parties with respect to such security.

                                      114
<PAGE>

special or punitive damages or any indirect or consequential loss whatsoever in
respect of any breach or wrongful conduct (whether or not the claim therefor is
based on contract, tort or duty imposed by law), in connection with, arising out
of or in any way related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the other Operative Documents or any act or omission or event occurring in
connection therewith, and each Borrower Party hereby waives, releases and agrees
not to sue upon any such claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and
whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor, in each case, except to
the extent such claim is based on gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Person.

      11.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

            ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, COLLATERAL AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE HEDGE
BANKS, THE LC ISSUER AND BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF

AGENT, COLLATERAL AGENT, THE LENDERS, THE HEDGE BANKS, THE LC ISSUER, OR
BORROWER. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR BORROWER, ADMINISTRATIVE

            Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Hedge
Banks, the LC Issuer and Borrower agree that any legal action or proceeding by
or against Borrower or with respect to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Notes, or any other Credit Document may be brought in or removed to the courts
of the State of New York, in and for the County of New York, or of the United
States of America for the Southern District of New York, as Administrative Agent
may elect. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Lenders, the Hedge
Banks, the LC Issuer, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Borrower
accept, for themselves and in respect of their property, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Hedge Banks, the LC Issuer and Borrower
irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned

Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Hedge Banks, the LC
Issuer and Borrower hereby waive any

                                      115
<PAGE>

require the payment of interest or other charges by Borrower or any other Person
in excess of the amount which the holders of the Notes may lawfully charge under
applicable usury laws. In the event that the Lenders shall collect moneys which
are deemed to constitute interest which would increase the effective interest
rate to a rate in excess of that permitted to be charged by applicable Legal
Requirements, all such sums deemed to constitute interest in excess of the legal
rate shall, upon such determination, at the option of the Lenders, be returned
to Borrower or credited against the principal balance then outstanding.

the agreements of the Lenders set forth in Sections 9.1, 9.5, 9.8, 9.10.1 and
11.22 shall survive the payment and performance of the Loans and the other
Obligations and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn hereunder, and the

      11.21 PATRIOT ACT NOTICE.

            Each Lender, the Collateral Agent (for itself and not on behalf of
any other Person, including any Lender), the Administrative Agent (for itself
and not on behalf of any other Person, including any Lender) and LC Issuer (for
itself and not on behalf of any other Person, including any Lender) hereby
notifies Borrower, Sponsor and each other Borrower Party that, pursuant to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act (2001 H.R. 3162 (signed into law October 26,
2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies Borrower, Sponsor and each other Borrower Party which information
includes the name, address, the tax identification number and other identifying
information that will allow such Lender, the Collateral Agent, the
Administrative Agent or the LC Issuer, as applicable, to identify Borrower,
Sponsor and each other Borrower Party in accordance with the Act.

      11.22 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.

            Each Lender and each Agent agrees (on behalf of itself and each of
its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives) to keep
confidential any nonpublic information supplied to it by Borrower or any other
Calpine Entity; provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any
such information: (a) to the extent such information is required to be disclosed
by any Governmental Rule or judicial or administrative process, or to any
Governmental Authority in connection with a tax audit or dispute or otherwise,
(b) to counsel for any of the Lenders or any Agent, (c) to banking, securities
exchange or other regulatory or supervisory authorities, auditors or accountants
having proper jurisdiction and authority to require such disclosure, (d) to any
Agent or any other Lender, (e) to any entity in connection with a securitization
or proposed securitization of, among other things, all or a part of any amounts
payable to or for the benefit of any Lender or its Affiliates under the Credit
Documents so long as such entity first executes and delivers to Administrative
Agent a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit M, (f) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any of the other
Credit Documents, including without limitation upon the occurrence of any Event
of Default and any enforcement or collection proceedings resulting therefrom or
in connection with the negotiation of any restructuring or "work-out", whether
or not consummated, of the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement or the
obligations of any Borrower Party or Major Project Participant under any other
Operative Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Credit Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, so long as such Borrower Party or Major Project Participant first
executes and delivers to the respective Lender and Borrower a confidentiality
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit M, (g) to the Independent
Engineer, the Power Marketing Consultant, the Insurance Consultant or to other
experts engaged

                                      117
<PAGE>

by Administrative Agent or any Lender in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby so long as
such expert first executes and delivers to Administrative Agent and Borrower a
confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit M, or (h) to any
assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) so long as such
assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) first executes
and delivers to the respective Lender and Borrower a confidentiality agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit M. In no event shall any Lender,
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent be obligated or required to return any
materials furnished by any Borrower Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 11.22, the foregoing obligation of confidentiality
shall not apply to any such information that (i) was known to any Lender or
Agent prior to the time it received such confidential information from any
Borrower Party or its respective Affiliates, or (ii) becomes part of the public
domain independently of any act of any Lender or Agent not permitted hereunder
(through publication or otherwise), or (iii) is received by any Lender or any
Agent, as applicable, without restriction as to its disclosure or use, from a
Person other than a Calpine Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein or in any other agreement to which the parties hereto are parties
or by which they are bound, any obligations of confidentiality contained herein
and therein, as they relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Loan Transactions"), shall not apply to the federal tax structure or
federal tax treatment of the Loan Transactions, and each party hereto (and any
employee, representative, or agent of any party hereto) may disclose to any and
all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the federal tax structure and
federal tax treatment of the Loan Transactions. The preceding sentence is
intended to cause the Loan Transactions not to be treated as having been offered
under conditions of confidentiality for purposes of Section 1.6011-4(b)(3) (or
any successor provision) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
6011 of the Code and shall be construed in a manner consistent with such
purpose. In addition, each party hereto acknowledges that it has no proprietary
or exclusive rights to any tax concept, tax matter or tax idea related to the
Loan Transactions. In addition, each party hereto acknowledges that it has no
proprietary or exclusive rights to any tax concept, tax matter or tax idea
related to the Loan Transactions. In addition, each Lender and each Agent
acknowledges that the Dow Documents contain various provisions on
confidentiality and each Lender and each Agent agree to be bound by the terms
thereof, including Article XIX (Confidential and Proprietary Information) of the
Capacity Sales Agreement to the extent applicable to the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement; provided that in connection with exercise of
remedies under the Credit Documents, each Lender and each Agent's obligations
under this sentence as to potential transferees of the Collateral shall be
limited to requiring the transferee to execute a confidentiality agreement.

      11.23 RELEASE OF PROJECT.

            At Borrower's option upon notice to Administrative Agent, without
the consent or approval of Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other
Person, the Collateral and the Undertaking Support LC corresponding to either
Project will be released, one of the two Siemens Turbines or substitute cash and
letter of credit pursuant to the Borrower Security Agreement will be released
and related Subordinated Note deemed cancelled, the Guaranties corresponding to
such Project shall terminate, the Intercompany Note corresponding to such
Project shall be

                                      118
<PAGE>

deemed paid in full, and the financing continue in reliance on the single
remaining Project, provided that (a) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio after
giving effect to such Project release shall be a minimum of 1.60x and an average
of 1.70x through the Term Loan Maturity Date; and (b) the Term Loan will be
prepaid such that the Term Loan balance on the Term Loan Maturity Date will be
no more than 90% of the loan balance at scheduled Term Loan maturity in the Pro
Forma Project Projections. If the Purchase Option or Put Option is exercised,
the proceeds, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) all of such proceeds, and
(ii) such amount as shall result in satisfaction of the criteria set forth in
clause (a) and clause (b) above, shall be applied to prepay the Loans (other
than the Security Fund LC Loans). The above tests will not be applied to a
prepayment related to an exercise of the Put Option or Purchase Option. Upon
exercise of either such option, the Collateral and Undertaking Support LC and
such Siemens Turbine or substitute cash and letter of credit corresponding to
the Freeport Project will be released and related Subordinated Note deemed
cancelled. Any proceeds from an exercise of the Put Option or Purchase Option,
in excess of the amounts required to be applied to a prepayment of the Loans
(other than the Security Fund LC Loans) to the levels as set forth in clauses
(a) and (b) will be released upon Term-Conversion, and until then held in the
Borrower Revenue Account as security for the Obligations of Borrower, or to the
extent received after Term-Conversion, released immediately to Sponsor without
condition.

      11.24 PROJECT EXPANSION.

            Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other Credit Document (including Section 9.9 hereof), upon approval (in
their sole discretion) by Lenders holding at least 80% of Proportionate Shares,
any Borrower Party at its option may obtain secured financing for an expansion
of either or both Projects to accommodate an additional combustion turbine and
related equipment. No Lender commits hereby or shall be construed by any other
term of any Credit Document to have committed to finance any such expansion.
