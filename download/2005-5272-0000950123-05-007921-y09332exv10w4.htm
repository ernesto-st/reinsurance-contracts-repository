Restrictive Covenant Agreement (defined below) and the remaining provisions of this Section&nbsp;IV, an

Employee&#146;s service with the Company (but no less than six nor more than 24&nbsp;years) (any such amount
shall be referred to in this Plan as the &#147;Severance&#148;). The Severance shall be payable in equal
installments (each, a &#147;Severance Installment&#148;) over a number of months equal to the six- to
24-month severance multiple described above (the &#147;Severance Period&#148;), in accordance with the
Company&#146;s normal payroll practices and commencing with the second of the Company&#146;s standard payroll
dates falling after such termination; provided, that, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator
(as defined in Section&nbsp;VII of the Plan, below), the Severance may be payable in a single lump sum
payment following termination of employment; and provided, further, that, if necessary to avoid the
application of Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), to the
Severance, the Eligible Employee shall not receive any Severance Installment until the first
scheduled payroll date that occurs more than six months following the date of termination of
employment (the &#147;First Payment Date&#148;), and, on the First Payment Date, the Company shall pay the
Eligible Employee an amount equal to the sum of all Severance Installments that would have been
payable in respect of the period preceding the First Payment Date but for the delay imposed on
account of the aforementioned Section&nbsp;409A;

spouse and dependents, if any, until the earlier of the expiration of the Severance Period and the
date the Eligible Employee is eligible to receive such benefits from a subsequent employer. During
the period that the Eligible Employee and any spouse or dependents are receiving benefits pursuant
to this Section&nbsp;IV.C, the Eligible Employee will be required to pay the costs of such coverage on
the same basis as when the Eligible Employee was actively employed (without taking account of the
pre-tax nature, if applicable, of such payments while the Eligible Employee was actively employed).
Coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 shall not commence until
the expiration of the Severance Period; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Additional service credit and credit for additional age in an amount equal to the number of
months in the Severance Period, under the Company&#146;s employee pension plans, except for under any
plan that is qualified or intended to be qualified under the provisions of Section&nbsp;401 of the Code,
for purposes of benefit accrual, matching contributions, vesting and eligibility for retirement.
For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts provided in Section&nbsp;IV.B of this Plan shall be included in
the calculation of any benefits to an Eligible Employee under any employee pension plan of the
Company that is not qualified or intended to be qualified under the provisions of Section&nbsp;401 of
the Code. Eligible Employees are not entitled to receive any payments pursuant to any such
non-qualified pension plan of the Company until the expiration of the Severance Period.

duties with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than any such failure resulting
from the Eligible Employee&#146;s incapacity due to physical or mental illness) for a period of 10&nbsp;days
after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Eligible Employee by the
Company, which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that the Eligible
Employee has not substantially performed the Eligible Employee&#146;s duties, (ii)&nbsp;the Eligible
Employee&#146;s malfeasance or misconduct, (iii)&nbsp;the Eligible Employee&#146;s knowing and material violation
of a material provision of the Company&#146;s Code of Conduct or the Director, Executive Officer and

or entry of a plea of guilty or no contest by the Eligible Employee with respect to, a felony or
any lesser crime of which fraud or dishonesty is a material element.

(or in such other manner acceptable to the Plan Administrator). The request for an appeal must be
filed with the Plan Administrator in person or by messenger, in either case, evidenced by written
receipt or by first-class postage-paid mail and return receipt requested, to the Plan

nevertheless agrees and hereby acknowledges that (A)&nbsp;such provisions do not impose a greater
restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interests of the Company, (B)
such provisions contain reasonable limitations as to time and scope of activity to be restrained,

burdensome to the Employee. In consideration of the foregoing and in light of the Employee&#146;s
education, skills and abilities, the Employee agrees that he shall not assert that, and it should
not be considered that, any provisions of Section&nbsp;VI.A. otherwise are void, voidable or
unenforceable or should be voided or held unenforceable.

the restrictions contained in this Section&nbsp;VI.A to be reasonable, if a judicial determination is
made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction
contained in this Section&nbsp;VI.A or elsewhere in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction
against the Employee, the provisions of the Agreement shall not be rendered void but shall be
deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such
court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of
competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and
such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the
enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
