                           deliver the Assets specified in the Withdrawal Notice
                           to, or for the account of, the Beneficiary or any
                           Designee; and

                  (b)      reduce any non-cash Assets to cash as instructed by
                           the Beneficiary.

         5.2      The Beneficiary hereby covenants with the Settlor that it
                  shall make withdrawals from the Trust Fund and use and apply
                  any Assets withdrawn from the Trust Fund only to pay or
                  reimburse the Beneficiary for the unpaid or unreimbursed
                  portion of the Settlor's share of the Obligations previously
                  paid by Beneficiary after netting any such amounts against
                  amounts owed to the Settlor by the Beneficiary regardless of
                  the source of such obligation and after demand on Settlor for
                  such amount has been dishonored.

         5.3      The Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to
                  determine that any Assets withdrawn from the Trust Fund
                  pursuant to Sub-Clause 5.1 of this Trust Agreement will be
                  used and applied in the manner contemplated by Sub-Clause 5.2.

         5.4      When the Trustee is directed to deliver Assets against
                  payment, delivery will be made in accordance with the
                  procedures applicable to the Asset class, or if none are
                  provided by the market for such Asset class, then within five
                  (5) Business Days. Assets in the Trust Fund shall be valued
                  according to their current fair market value.

         5.5      No Assets shall be withdrawn from the Trust Fund or used in
                  any manner for paying compensation to, or reimbursing expenses
                  of, or indemnifying, the Trustee except for indemnification
                  provided by the Settlor to the Trustee under Sub-Clause 10.2.2
                  and as provided for in sub-Clause 9.3.

         5.6      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement,
                  all Income in respect of Assets in the Trust Fund shall be for
                  the benefit of the Settlor and shall be deposited by the
                  Trustee in the Income Account. The Settlor may give the
                  Trustee Proper Instructions to deliver all or any portion of
                  the Income Account to the Settlor or as it instructs.

         5.7      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if the Trustee
                  has received Proper Instructions from the Settlor stating that
                  there has been an Event of Insolvency or a claim under the
                  Policy is outstanding, the Trustee shall provide a copy of
                  such Proper Instructions to the Beneficiary forthwith and set
                  aside such part of the Assets of the Trust Fund as is stated
                  in the Proper Instructions to be required to settle the
                  amounts due under the Policy or which the Settlor instructs
                  should be set aside pending determination of the amount due
                  under the Policy following an Event of Insolvency or a claim
                  under the Policy, unless objected to in writing by the
                  Beneficiary to the Settlor and Trustee within five (5)
                  Business Days of delivery by the Trustee to the Beneficiary of
                  the Settlor's Proper Instructions, and if so objected to, then
                  as jointly instructed by the Settlor and the Beneficiary or as
                  directed by an arbitration award entered in accordance with
                  procedures set out in Clause 24 that is no longer subject to
                  appeal. Except as provided for in Section 5.8, the Assets set
                  aside shall not be available for a Withdrawal Request until
                  Trustee receives joint instructions from Beneficiary and
                  Settlor or as directed by an arbitration award entered in
                  accordance with procedures set out in Clause 24 that is no
                  longer subject to appeal. Pending resolution of any dispute
                  between Beneficiary and Settlor as to the amount to be set
                  aside, Trustee shall not reduce the Assets pursuant to a
                  Withdrawal Notice below the amount Settlor claims should be
                  set aside. Any Assets not subject to restraint by virtue of
                  the foregoing provisions in Sub-Clause 5.7 shall be maintained
                  and paid as otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement.

         5.8      For the purposes of Sub-Clause 5.7, it is agreed that the only
                  matter to be determined by the Settlor and Beneficiary or by
                  arbitration is the amount due to the Settlor under the Policy
                  or other obligation of Beneficiary to Settlor and the amount
                  due to the Beneficiary under the Reinsurance Agreements in
                  respect of Obligations or other obligation of Settlor to
                  Beneficiary. Once such amounts are determined, the following
                  procedure shall be followed (the "Netting Procedure"). The
                  amounts shall be netted and if the balance is due and owing to
                  the Settlor, the Beneficiary shall pay the net amount to the
                  Settlor as provided for in the Policy or other evidence of
                  obligation and if the balance is due and owing to the
                  Beneficiary, the Beneficiary may withdraw Assets from the
                  Trust equal to the net amount due to Beneficiary and the
                  Settlor shall pay any deficiency to the Beneficiary.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Settlor may defer the
                  Netting Procedure upon the occurrence of an Event of
                  Insolvency until all amounts that may become due from
                  Beneficiary to Settlor under the Policy, Reinsurance
                  Agreements or otherwise are determinable.

         5.9      Within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each calendar
                  month, the Beneficiary shall provide the Settlor and Trustee
                  with a report setting forth the amount required to be in the
                  Trust Fund pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreements. The Settlor
                  may object in writing to the Beneficiary's report within such
                  ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such report and, if the
                  Settlor and Beneficiary are unable to mutually agree to a
                  resolution of the Settlor's objection, then such objection
                  shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to Clause 24.

         5.10     In the event that the fair market value of the Assets exceeds
                  the amount required to remain in the Trust Fund pursuant to
                  the Reinsurance Agreements as determined in accordance with
                  Sub-Clauses 5.7 and 5.9, the Trustee shall, during the Trust
                  Period

                  5.10.1   pay, transfer, appropriate or apply such part of the
                           Assets of the Trust Fund to or for the benefit of the
                           Settlor in such manner as the Settlor shall direct by
                           a Withdrawal Request to the Trustee provided (i) the
                           remaining Assets in the Trust Fund comply with the
                           requirements of the Fifth Schedule as determined by
                           Settlor, and (ii) after notice to the Beneficiary of
                           the Assets to be withdrawn, Beneficiary does not
                           object by notice to Settlor and Trustee within ten
                           (10) Business Days of receipt of the notice to it and
                           if objected to, then as jointly instructed by
                           Beneficiary and Settlor or pursuant to an arbitration
                           award under Clause 24 no longer subject to appeal;
                           and

                  5.10.2   reduce any non-cash Assets to cash as instructed by
                           the Settlor, subject to the same provisos as in
                           Sub-Clause 5.10.1.

<PAGE>

                                      -9-


         5.11     In the event that the fair market value of the Assets is less
                  than the amount required to be in the Trust Fund pursuant to
                  the Reinsurance Agreements as determined in accordance with
                  Sub-Clause 5.9, then the Settlor shall transfer Eligible
                  Securities to the Trust Fund within fifteen (15) Business Days
                  of receipt of Beneficiaries Clause 5.9 report, or if the
                  Settlor objects as provided for in Sub-Clause 5.9, then within
                  ten (10) business Days of the resolution of such objection, so
                  that the fair market value of the Assets in the Trust Fund
                  shall equal the amount required.

         5.12     In the event that all the Obligations of the Settlor have been
                  discharged, as jointly agreed by the Beneficiary and the
                  Settlor, or determined in an arbitration award that is no
                  longer subject to appeal, issued under the arbitration
                  procedures as set out in Clause 24, the Trustee shall, subject
                  to any lien or other right to payment of sums due to it, pay,
                  transfer, appropriate or apply the whole or any part of the
                  Trust Fund, to or for the benefit of the Settlor.

6.       INVESTMENT OF ASSETS

         6.1      Subject to Sub-Clause 6.2, the Assets shall be invested in
                  Eligible Securities.

         6.2      The Trustee shall at all times be bound by and only act upon
                  the directions of the Settlor in the investment of the Trust
                  Fund. The Settlor shall instruct the Trustee to invest the
                  Trust Fund in accordance with any applicable provisions of the
                  Reinsurance Agreements but only in securities complying with
                  the Fifth Schedule. Trustee shall have no responsibility
                  whatsoever to determine whether or not the investments are
                  Eligible Securities or comply with the Reinsurance Agreements.

         6.3      The Settlor shall have the power to instruct the Trustee to
                  liquidate as well as to deliver any Assets as instructed by
                  the Settlor provided that, except when the liquidation or
                  delivery relates to a Withdrawal Notice or Withdrawal Request,
                  the Trustee receives Eligible Securities of the same or
                  greater fair market value as those delivered out, as
                  determined by the Settlor, or such lesser fair market value
                  which, when taking the provisions of Sub-Clause 5.10 into
                  account, result in the fair market value of the Assets being
                  equal to the total amount required to be in trust by the
                  Reinsurance Agreements, all as determined by Settlor. Except
                  for settlement in accordance with Sub-Clause 5.4, Settlor
                  shall arrange the timing of delivery of Assets out of the
                  Trust Fund, other than pursuant to a Withdrawal Notice or
                  Withdrawal Request, so that with the fair market value of
                  Assets replacing those delivered out and the fair market value
                  of Assets in the Trust Fund is not less than the fair market
                  value required by the Reinsurance Agreements to be in the
                  Trust Fund.

                                      -10-


         6.4      The Settlor shall have the power to exercise all rights with
                  respect to the Assets that the owner of record would have the
                  right to exercise provided that the fair market value of the
                  Trust Fund is not less than the total amount required by the
                  Reinsurance Agreements by virtue of the exercise of any such
                  rights. Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to
                  determine the fair market value of the Trust Fund.

7.       ADDITIONAL POWERS

         7.1      The Trustee shall, during the Trust Period and such further
                  period (if any) as the law shall allow, have the following
                  additional powers:

                  POWER TO MANAGE AS IF ABSOLUTE OWNER

                  7.1.1    subject to the other provisions of this Trust
                           Agreement including Sub-Clauses 6.2-6.4, power to
                           effect any transaction concerning or affecting any
                           part of the Trust Fund or any other property
                           whatsoever, if the Trustee considers the transaction
                           is for the benefit of the Trust Fund or of the
                           Beneficiary or the Settlor or any of them, as if the
                           Trustee were an absolute owner beneficially entitled
                           to the Trust Fund;

                  POWER TO RECEIVE ADDITIONS

                  7.1.2    power to receive any property as an addition to the
                           Trust Fund;

                  POWER TO VOTE AND GIVE PROXIES

                  7.1.3    with respect to any investments constituting the
                           whole or part of the Trust Fund, the Trustee shall
                           forward all annual and interim company reports and
                           all proxies and proxy materials relating to the
                           Assets to the Settlor who shall have the full and
                           unqualified right to vote in respect of such Assets;

                  POWER TO KEEP TRUST FUND ABROAD

                  7.1.4    (a) power to keep the whole or any part of the Trust
                           Fund either within or outside Bermuda and, if the
                           Trustee think fit, to hold in any part of the world
                           all or any securities or other property in bearer
                           form or in the names of the Trustee or in the name of
                           some other appointed nominee without disclosing the
                           fiduciary relationship, with power to remunerate such
                           nominee, provided the Trustee acts in a prudent
                           manner in holding assets in the name of a third party
                           or outside Bermuda and such action by the Trustee
                           will not subject the Assets of the Trust Fund, the
                           Settlor or the Beneficiary to any form of taxation,
                           duties or other governmental charges in any
                           jurisdiction.

                           (b) Unless consented to by the Settlor, if the
                           Trustee voluntarily moves the Assets from where such
                           Assets were originally domiciled when contributed to
                           the Trust Fund by the Settlor, then any resulting
                           duties, fees, taxes or other governmental charges
                           shall be for the account of the Trustee and paid
                           directly by the Trustee or restored by the Trustee to
                           the Trust Fund if paid therefrom. Additionally, if
                           the voluntary movement of such Assets by the Trustee
                           allows them to be attached or levied upon in any
                           dispute, the reduction in Assets shall be restored by
                           the Trustee. This provision 7.1.4 (b) shall
                           additionally apply to Sub-Clause 7.1.5 below;

                  POWER TO PAY DUTIES

                  7.1.5    in the event of any duties, fees, taxes or other
                           governmental charges whatsoever becoming payable in
                           any part of the world in respect of the Trust Fund or
                           any part thereof in any circumstances whatsoever,
                           power to pay all such duties, fees, taxes or other
                           governmental charges out of the Trust Fund or the
                           income thereof, not less than seven (7) Business Days
                           after notice of the intention to pay is given to
                           Settlor and Beneficiary by Trustee, with discretion
                           otherwise as to the time and manner in which the said
                           duties, fees, taxes or other governmental charges
                           shall be paid and the Trustee may pay such duties,
                           fees, taxes or other governmental charges
                           notwithstanding that the same shall not be
                           recoverable from the Trustee, except in circumstances

                  for, and hold each Indemnified Person harmless against, any
                  loss, liability, costs or expenses (including reasonable
                  attorney's fees and expenses), incurred without gross
                  negligence (negligence in a claim related to its
                  representation in Sub-Clause 26.1), wilful misconduct,
                  dishonesty or fraud on the part of the Indemnified Person as
                  provided for herein, arising out of or in connection with the
                  performance of the Indemnified Person's obligations under and

                  of or in connection with the status of the Trustee and its

                  Settlor and the Beneficiary acknowledge that the foregoing
                  indemnities shall survive the resignation of the Trustee or
                  the termination of this Trust Agreement.

         10.2

                  10.2.1   Notwithstanding the provisions of Sub-Clause 10.1, no

                           Settlor under this indemnity provision unless a claim
                           for indemnity has been made to Beneficiary containing
                           such details as a person acting in a reasonable and
                           commercial manner as to the indemnity claim would
                           require to act on such claim and Beneficiary has not
                           acted on such claim in 30 days of its receipt or such
                           shorter period as is reasonable under the
                           circumstances, or has denied such claim in such
                           period.

                           if the Settlor is the cause of the loss, liability,
                           cost or expense for which indemnity is sought under
                           Sub-Clause 10.1, then the Settlor shall be liable for
                           such indemnity and in seeking indemnity, each
                           Indemnified Person shall follow the procedure in
                           10.2.1 as to substantiating the claim substituting
                           Settlor for Beneficiary and if the Settlor has not
                           acted on such claim in the 30-day period provided for
                           in Sub-Clause 10.1, the indemnified party may apply
                           to Trustee to satisfy such claim from the Trust Fund;
                           and if Trustee is the indemnified party, it may pay
                           its claim from the Trust Fund.

         10.3     No Trustee shall be bound to take any proceedings against a
                  former trustee hereof for any breach or alleged breach of
                  trust committed or suffered by such former trustee.

         10.4     The Trustee shall not be liable for acting upon any written
                  Proper Instructions or written confirmation which the Trustee
                  believes in good faith to be genuine and to be signed by the
                  proper party.

11.      RECEIPT OF INCOME

         Unless the Trustee in its discretion shall otherwise determine, all
         Income received by the Trustee shall be treated for all purposes hereof
         as Income at the date of receipt, irrespective of the period in
         relation to which such Income shall have been earned.

12.      PROTECTION OF THIRD PARTIES

         12.1     No person dealing with the Trustee and no purchaser on any
                  sale made by the Trustee shall be concerned to enquire into
                  the propriety or validity of any act of the Trustee or to see
                  to the application of any money paid or property transferred
                  to or upon the order of the Trustee;

         12.2     No company any of whose securities are comprised in the Trust
                  Fund and no purchaser or person dealing with any person
                  purporting to act under any delegation of authority from any
                  Trustee shall be required to ascertain or enquire whether a
                  case exists in which such delegation is permitted or whether
                  such delegated authority is still subsisting;

         12.3     When anything is dependent upon the fair market value of any
                  property or the existence of any fact, the certificate of the
                  Trustee as to such fair market value or fact shall be
                  conclusive in favour of anyone acting thereon in good faith.

18.      ASSIGNS

         Neither the Beneficiary nor the Settlor may assign this Trust Agreement
         nor any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
         consent of the other party and the Trustee.

19.      APPOINTMENT AND RETIREMENT OF TRUSTEE

         19.1     The Trustee may resign at any time by giving not less than
                  ninety (90) calendar days written notice of such resignation
                  to the Beneficiary and to the Settlor. The Trustee may be
                  removed by the Settlor's and Beneficiary's joint agreement
                  (with any dispute between the Beneficiary and Settlor being
                  resolved under the arbitration procedures as set out in Clause
                  24) and delivery of not less than ninety (90) calendar days
                  written notice of such removal to the Trustee (which may be
                  shortened by the Settlor and Beneficiary if the Trustee has
                  violated the standard of care set forth in Clause 8.7 or any
                  of its representations or warranties are, when made, or
                  become, untrue); such resignation, subject to the provisions
                  of Clause 19.3 below, or removal, shall become effective on or
                  after the notice period upon:

                  (a)      the appointment of a successor trustee by the Settlor
                           and the Beneficiary (with any dispute being resolved
                           under the arbitration procedures as set out in Clause
                           24),

                  (b)      the acceptance of such appointment by the successor
                           Trustee, and

                  (c)      the transfer of all Assets in the Trust Fund to such
                           successor Trustee in accordance with Sub-Clause 19.2.

         19.2     Any successor Trustee shall be a duly licensed trust company
                  and shall not be a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate of
                  either the Settlor or the Beneficiary. The successor Trustee
                  shall succeed and become vested with all the rights, powers,
                  privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Trustee, and
                  the resigning or removed Trustee shall be discharged from any
                  future duties and obligations under this Trust Agreement, but
                  the resigning or removed Trustee shall continue after such
                  resignation or removal to be entitled to the benefits of the
                  indemnities provided herein for the Trustee and subject to any
                  liability provided for herein while acting as Trustee
                  hereunder.

                                      -20-


         19.3     If the Trustee has sought to resign in accordance with the
                  procedures outlined in Sub-Clause 19.1 above and the Settlor
                  and Beneficiary have not appointed a successor trustee within
                  120 days of the Trustee's notice, the Trustee shall have the
                  power to apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda to be relieved
                  of its responsibilities and to have the Assets of the Trust
                  Fund paid into court and the Income Account delivered to
                  Settlor or as it instructs. Upon approval by the court, the
                  resigning Trustee shall be discharged from any future duties
                  and obligations under this Trust Agreement, but the resigning
                  Trustee shall continue after such resignation to be entitled
                  to the benefits of the indemnities provided for herein for the
                  Trustee and subject to any liability provided for herein while
                  acting as Trustee hereunder.

         19.4     Acts and deeds done or executed for the proper vesting of the
                  Trust Fund in a new Trustee shall be done and executed by the
                  retiring Trustee at the expense of the Beneficiary.

20.      SETTLOR'S POWER TO CHANGE PROPER LAW AND FORUM

         20.1     The Settlor, with the written consent of the Beneficiary, may,
                  at any time and from time to time by deed, change the Proper
                  Law of this Trust to the law of some other jurisdiction in any
                  part of the world and, as from the date of such deed, the law
                  of the jurisdiction named therein shall be the Proper Law of
                  this Trust and the courts of that jurisdiction shall be the
                  forum for the administration thereof, but subject to the
                  powers conferred by this Sub-Clause 20.1 and until any further
                  change is made hereunder, provided that, notwithstanding
                  anything herein contained, the Settlor shall not exercise such
                  power in any way which might directly or indirectly result in
                  this Trust becoming according to the law applicable thereto
                  illegal, void or voidable or which might change the beneficial
                  interests hereunder.

         20.2     So often as any change of the Proper Law of this Trust shall
                  be made pursuant to the provisions of Sub-Clause 20.1, the
                  Trustee may at any time, either then or thereafter, by deed
                  make such alterations and additions to the trusts, powers and
                  provisions hereof as the Trustee may consider necessary or
                  desirable to ensure that, so far as may be possible, the
                  trusts, powers and provisions hereof shall, mutatis mutandis,
                  be as valid and effective as they were immediately prior to
                  such change.

21.      COUNTERPARTS

         This Trust Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in any number of
         counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall
         constitute an original, but such counterparts together shall constitute
         but one and the same Trust Agreement.

22.      POWER TO VARY

         Settlor and Beneficiary may, at any time and from time to time, by deed
         supplemental hereto, amend in whole or in part any or all of the
         provisions of this Trust Agreement whether to cure any ambiguity or to
         cure, correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any
         supplemental deed or deeds or otherwise; provided that any such
         modification that alters or increases the duties or obligations of the
         Trustee or diminishes its rights shall not be binding upon the Trustee
         unless such modification has been accepted by the Trustee in writing.

23.      TERMINATION OF TRUST

         23.1     The Trust Fund and this Trust Agreement, except for the
                  indemnities provided herein and the liability of the Trustee
                  for negligence or gross negligence (as applicable), wilful
                  misconduct, dishonesty or fraud, may be terminated, except as
                  provided in Clause 23.2, only after the Settlor and the
                  Beneficiary have given the Trustee written notice of their
                  joint intention to terminate the Trust (the "NOTICE OF
                  INTENTION") (with any dispute between Settlor and Beneficiary
                  being resolved under the Arbitration procedures as outlined in
                  Clause 24 and any order therefrom no longer being subject to
                  appeal). The Notice of Intention shall specify the date on
                  which the notifying Party intends the Trust to terminate which
                  shall be not less than 30 nor more than 45 calendar days after
                  the date of the Notice of Intention (the "PROPOSED DATE").

         23.2     The Settlor alone may terminate this Trust Agreement without
                  diminishing the right of the Trustee to indemnity or the
                  Trustee's obligation for past conduct when the Settlor is no
                  longer required to secure its obligations under and in
                  accordance with the terms of the Reinsurance Agreements on
                  notice to the Beneficiary and the Trustee of the Termination
                  Date which shall not be less than 30 nor more than 45 calendar
                  days from the date of such notice , unless objected to by
                  Beneficiary within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such
                  notice, in which event such termination shall be on such date
                  as is jointly agreed by Settlor and Beneficiary, or as
                  determined under the Arbitration provisions in Clause 24 with
                  any order therefrom no longer being subject to appeal. Such
                  arbitration award shall also grant Settlor and its
                  shareholders such damages as they establish were caused by the
                  wrongful delay by Beneficiary in the termination of the Trust
                  provided Beneficiary's objection was not reasonable under the
                  circumstances.

         23.3     On the Termination Date, the Trustee shall transfer to the
                  Settlor any Assets remaining in the Trust Fund, at which time
                  all liability of the Trustee with respect to such Assets shall
                  cease, except for the Trustee's liability for negligence or
                  gross negligence (as applicable), wilful misconduct,
                  dishonesty or fraud with respect thereto.

24.      ARBITRATION

         24.1     All matters of difference between the Beneficiary and Settlor
                  arising under, out of or in connection with this Trust
                  Agreement, shall be referred to an arbitration tribunal in the
                  manner hereinafter set out.

         24.2     Unless the parties to the arbitration appoint a sole
                  arbitrator within 14 calendar days of one receiving a written
                  request from the other for arbitration, the claimant (the
                  party requesting arbitration) shall appoint his arbitrator and
                  give written notice hereof to the respondent. Within 30
                  calendar days of receiving such notice, the respondent shall
                  appoint his arbitrator and give written notice thereof to the
                  claimant, failing which the claimant may apply to the
                  appointor hereafter named to nominate an arbitrator on behalf
                  of the respondent.

         24.3     Before they enter upon a reference, the two arbitrators shall
                  appoint a third arbitrator. Should they fail to appoint such a
                  third arbitrator within 30 calendar days of the appointment of
                  the respondent's arbitrator, then either of them or either of
                  the parties may apply to the appointor for the appointment of
                  the third arbitrator. The three arbitrators shall decide by
                  majority. The third arbitrator shall also act as chairman of
                  the tribunal.

         24.4     Unless the parties otherwise agree the arbitration tribunal
                  shall consist of persons (including those who have retired)
                  with not less than ten years' experience of insurance or
                  reinsurance as persons engaged in the industry itself or as
                  lawyers or other professional advisers, not then or in the
                  preceding five years engaging in or employed or otherwise
                  associated with entities engaging in any business with any of
                  the parties, not related to any employee or agent of any of
                  the parties and not otherwise having any interest in the
                  outcome of the arbitration.

         24.5     The arbitration tribunal shall, so far as is permissible under
                  the law and practice of the place of arbitration, have power
                  to fix all procedural rules for the holding of the arbitration
                  including discretionary power to make orders as to any matters
                  which it may consider proper in the circumstances of the case
                  with regard to pleadings, discovery, inspection of the
                  documents, examination of witnesses and any other matter
                  whatsoever relating to the conduct of the arbitration and may
                  receive and act upon such evidence whether oral or written
                  strictly admissible or not as it shall in its discretion think
                  fit.

         24.6     The appointor shall be the Chairman for the time being of
                  Arias (UK) or if he is unavailable or it is inappropriate for
                  him to act for any reason, such persons as may be nominated by
                  the Committee of Arias (UK). If for any reason such persons
                  decline or are unable to act, then the appointor shall be the
                  nominating committee of the Chartered Institute of
                  Arbitrators, Bermuda Branch.

                                      -23-


         24.7     The place of arbitration shall be in Bermuda, unless the
                  Beneficiary and Settlor agree otherwise.

         24.8     The arbitration shall be carried out under the law of Bermuda
                  and shall be an international commercial arbitration subject
                  to the provisions of the International Conciliation and
                  Arbitration Act 1993.

         24.9     The arbitral award shall be in writing, shall state reasons
                  for the award, and be final and binding on the parties.
                  Judgment on the award may be entered by any court having
                  jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the parties
                  or their assets or the Assets of the Trust Fund.

         24.10    Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and
                  shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the cost
                  of the third arbitrator. The remaining costs of the
                  arbitration shall be allocated by the panel. The panel may, at
                  its discretion, award such further costs and expenses as it
                  considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorneys
                  fees, to the extent permitted by law. However, the panel may
                  not award any exemplary or punitive damages.
