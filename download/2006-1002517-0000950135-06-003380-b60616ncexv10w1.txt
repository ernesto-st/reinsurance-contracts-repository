          "Adjustment Date" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the

          "Administrative Agent" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in

forth herein:

          (a) each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment agrees to make Term Loans
to the Borrower on the Closing Date in a principal amount not to exceed its Term
Loan Commitment; and

          (b) each Revolving Facility Lender agrees to make Revolving Facility
Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an
aggregate principal amount that will not result in (i) such Revolving Facility
Lender's Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding such Revolving Facility
Lender's Revolving Facility Commitment or (ii) the total Revolving Facility
Credit Exposure exceeding the total Revolving Facility Commitments; provided
that the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Facility Loans made on the

          SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings.

          (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans
under the same Facility and of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with their respective Commitments under the applicable Facility (or,
in the case of Swingline Loans, in accordance with their respective Swingline
Commitments); provided, however, that Revolving Facility Loans shall be made by
the Revolving Facility Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
Revolving Facility Percentages on the date such Loans are made hereunder. The
failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the
Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for
any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

          (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Borrowing (other than a Swingline
Borrowing) shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the
Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Borrowing shall be
an ABR Borrowing. Each Lender at its option may make any ABR Loan or
Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and such Lender shall not be entitled to any amounts
payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17 solely in respect of increased costs
resulting from such exercise and existing at the time of such exercise.

          (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency
Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing
Minimum. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing
shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing
Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum; provided that an ABR Revolving
Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused
balance of the Revolving Facility Commitments or that is required to finance the
reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Each
Swingline Borrowing shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the
Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Borrowings of more
than one Type and under more than one Facility may be outstanding at the same
time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of (i) 5
Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding under the Term Facility and (ii) 10
Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

          (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Revolving Facility Maturity Date or the Term Facility Maturity Date,
as applicable.

          SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a Revolving
Borrowing and/or a Term Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing,
not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of
the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than
12:00 noon, Local Time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed
Borrowing; provided that any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to
finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as contemplated by Section
2.05(e) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the date of the
proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable
and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the
Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and
written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance
with Section 2.02:


                                      -35-

<PAGE>

          (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

          (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurocurrency Borrowing;

          (iv) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial Interest
     Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by
     the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

          (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds
     are to be disbursed.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with
this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of
the requested Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans.

          (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower from time to
time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding the Swingline Commitment or (ii) the total
Revolving Facility Credit Exposure exceeding the total Revolving Facility
Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a
Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Borrowing. Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

          (b) To request a Swingline Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender of such request by telephone
(confirmed promptly by a Swingline Borrowing Request by telecopy), not later
than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Borrowing. Each
such notice and Swingline Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
specify (i) the requested date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the amount
of the requested Swingline Borrowing and (iii) the location and number of the
Borrower's account to which funds comprising the requested Swingline Borrowing
are to be disbursed. The Swingline Lender shall consult with the Administrative
Agent as to whether the making of the Swingline Loan is in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement prior to the Swingline Lender funding such Swingline
Loan. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan in accordance with
Section 2.02(a) on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by 3:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Borrower (or, in
the case of a Swingline Borrowing made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable
Issuing Bank).

          (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on any Business Day
require the Revolving Facility Lenders to acquire participations on such
Business Day in all or a portion of the outstanding Swingline Loans made by it.
Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loans in which
the Revolving Facility Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such
notice, the Administrative Agent will give


                                      -36-

<PAGE>

notice thereof to each such Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving
Facility Lender's Revolving Facility Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.
Each Revolving Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees,
upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Swingline Lender, such Revolving Facility Lender's Revolving
Facility Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Facility
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Facility Lender shall comply with its
obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by
such Revolving Facility Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis,
to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Facility Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower
of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph,
and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the
Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by
the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the
Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender
of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted
to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative
Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving
Facility Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph
and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any
such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of
participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve
the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

          SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit.

          (a) General. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit in
Dollars, or if an Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent that it is capable of doing so, in an Alternate Currency, for its own
account or the account of a Subsidiary in a form reasonably acceptable to the
applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the
Availability Period and prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Revolving Facility Maturity Date; provided that the Borrower shall be a
co-applicant, and be jointly and severally liable, with respect to each Letter
of Credit issued for the account of a Subsidiary. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement
submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing
Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

          (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal (other than an automatic renewal in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section) or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to
the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (three Business Days in
advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a
notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter
of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the Approved
Currency, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be
a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which
shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of
Credit, whether the


                                      -37-

<PAGE>

Letter of Credit is to be issued for its own account or for the account of a
Subsidiary (provided that the Borrower shall be a co-applicant, and therefore
jointly and severally liable, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued for
the account of a Subsidiary), the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
and such other information as shall be necessary to issue, amend, renew or
extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the
Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's
standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of
Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Revolving L/C Exposure shall not exceed
the total L/C Commitment, (ii) the total Revolving Facility Credit Exposure
shall not exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments and (iii) the
Alternate Currency L/C Exposure shall not exceed the Alternate Currency L/C
Sublimit.

          (c) Expiration Date.

          (i) Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of
business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance
of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof,
one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five
Business Days prior to the Revolving Facility Maturity Date; provided that any
Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the automatic renewal
thereof for additional one-year periods (which, in no event, shall extend beyond
the date referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph (c) unless otherwise
agreed by the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent).

          (ii) If Borrower so requests in any Letter of Credit Request, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter
of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an "Auto-Renewal Letter
of Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit
the Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month
period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving
prior notice to the Borrower and to the beneficiary thereof not later than a
date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter
of Credit is issued and to be set forth therein. Unless otherwise directed by
the Issuing Bank, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to
the Issuing Bank for any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has
been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may
not require) the Issuing Bank to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at
any time to an expiry date not later than the earlier of (i) one year from the
date of such renewal and (ii) the date that the Letter of Credit expires;
provided that the Issuing Bank shall not permit any such renewal if (x) the
Issuing Bank has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to
issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof, or (y)
it has received notice on or before the day that is two Business Days before the
date which has been agreed upon pursuant to the proviso of the first sentence of
this paragraph, (1) from the Administrative Agent that any Revolving Lender
directly affected thereby has elected not to permit such renewal or (2) from the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or Borrower that one or more of the applicable
conditions specified in Section 4.01 are not then satisfied; provided, further,
that the Issuing Bank or Administrative Agent may require any such letter of
credit to permit cancellation of such automatic renewal provision upon at least
90 days' prior written notice.

          (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving
Facility Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Facility
Lender, and each Revolving Facility Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Facility
Lender's Revolving Facility Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration


                                      -38-

<PAGE>

and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Facility Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Revolving Facility Lender's
Revolving Facility Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)
of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the
Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in
respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

          (e) Reimbursement. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any L/C
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
L/C Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such
L/C Disbursement in the Approved Currency in which the L/C Disbursement giving
rise to such payment is denominated not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on (i)
the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice under paragraph (g) of this
Section of such L/C Disbursement, if such notice is received on such day prior
to 12:00 noon, Local Time, or (ii) if clause (i) does not apply, the Business
Day immediately following the date the Borrower receives such notice; provided
that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed
with an ABR Revolving Borrowing, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to
reimburse any L/C Disbursement when due, then the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank and each other Revolving Facility
Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the
Borrower in respect thereof and, in the case of a Revolving Facility Lender,
such Lender's Revolving Facility Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt
of such notice, each Revolving Facility Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent its Revolving Facility Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the payment
then due from the Borrower in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Facility Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the
amounts so received by it from the Revolving Facility Lenders. Promptly
following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower
pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Facility
Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing
Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear;
provided that, in the case of Alternate Currency Letters of Credit, payment to
such Lenders shall be in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the payment. Any
payment made by a Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement (other than the funding of an
ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Borrowing as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such L/C Disbursement.

          (f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any
draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a
Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that


                                      -39-

<PAGE>

might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations
hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank,
nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by
reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit
or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of
the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit
(including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond
the control of such Issuing Bank, or any of the circumstances referred to in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence; provided that the foregoing
shall not be construed to excuse the applicable Issuing Bank from liability to
the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential or
punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower
to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (i) such
Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof
or (ii) such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when refusing to issue a
Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall
be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination and each refusal to
issue a Letter of Credit. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting
the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the
terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole
discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

          (g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank
has made or will make a L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure
to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Facility Lenders
with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.

          (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in
full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such L/C
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if such L/C Disbursement is not reimbursed by the Borrower when
due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of
payment by any Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such
Revolving Facility Lender to the extent of such payment.

          (i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at
any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time
any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid
fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.12. From and after


                                      -40-

<PAGE>

the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall
have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii)
references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such
successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous
Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing
Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
replacement but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

          (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, (i) in the case of an Event of Default described in Section 7.01(h)
or (i), on the Business Day or (ii) in the case of any other Event of Default
(subject to Section 7.01), on the third Business Day, in each case, following
the date on which the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent
(or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Facility
Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total
Revolving L/C Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to
this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative
Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the
Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such date
plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or
(i) of Section 7.01, the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become
effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind. Each such deposit pursuant
to this paragraph shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for
the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control,
including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any
interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be
made at the option and sole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default
shall be continuing, the Administrative Agent and (ii) at any other time, the
Borrower, in each case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense of
the Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing
Bank for L/C Disbursements for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed
and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such
time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the
consent of Revolving Facility Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total Revolving L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy
other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

          (k) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the Borrower may by
notice to the Administrative Agent designate up to three Lenders (in addition to
UBS AG, Stamford Branch) each of which agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in
such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as an
Issuing Bank. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart of
this Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank
hereunder for all purposes.

          (l) Reporting. Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent,
each Issuing Bank shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of any
notice received from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(b) no later than the
next Business Day after receipt thereof and (ii) report in writing to the
Administrative Agent (A) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing
Bank expects

to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the
Letters of Credit to be issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and
outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), and the Issuing
Bank shall be permitted to issue, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit
if the Administrative Agent shall not have advised the Issuing Bank that such
issuance, amendment renewal or extension would not be in conformity with the
requirements of this Agreement, (B) on each Business Day on which such Issuing
Bank makes any L/C Disbursement, the date of such L/C Disbursement and the
amount of such L/C Disbursement and (C) on any other Business Day, such other
information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request, including but
not limited to prompt verification of such information as may be requested by
the Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings.

          (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00
noon, Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that
Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative
Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained
with the Administrative Agent in New York City; provided that ABR Revolving
Loans and Swingline Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of a L/C
Disbursement and reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted
by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such
Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections.

          (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the
applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall
have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type
or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may
elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower
may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the
Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising
each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall
not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.


                                      -42-

<PAGE>

          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were
requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election
Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly (but in any event
on the same Business Day) by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative
Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by such Borrower.

          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

          (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and,
     if different options are being elected with respect to different portions
     thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing
     (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii)
     and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

          (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest
     Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

          (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
     Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

          (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the
     Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
     election, which shall be a period contemplated by clause (a) of the
     definition of the term "Interest Period."

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election
Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each
resulting Borrowing.

          (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the written request (including a request through electronic means) of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default
is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a
Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall
be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.

          SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

          (a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitments
shall terminate on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the Term Loan Commitments will terminate at 5:00 p.m., Local
Time, on the Closing Date.

          (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments under either Facility; provided that (i) each reduction
of the Commitments under either Facility


                                      -43-

<PAGE>

shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1 million and not less
than $5 million (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Revolving Facility
Commitments) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving
Facility Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the
Revolving Facility Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Revolving Facility
Credit Exposure would exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments.

          (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments under paragraph (b) of
this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice
delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Facility Commitments
delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any
termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction
of the Commitments under either Facility shall be made ratably among the Lenders
in accordance with their respective Commitments under such Facility.

          SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

          (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Facility Lender the then
unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Facility Loan to the Borrower on the
Revolving Facility Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of
such Lender as provided in Section 2.10 and (iii) to the Swingline Lender the
then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the
Revolving Facility Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is
made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least five
Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that
a Revolving Facility Borrowing is made by the Borrower, the Borrower shall repay
all Swingline Loans then outstanding. Once prepaid or repaid, Term Loans may not
be reborrowed.

          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Facility and Type thereof
and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's
share thereof.

          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note (a "Note"). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute
and deliver to such Lender a promissory


                                      -44-

<PAGE>
note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to
such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note
and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to
Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form
payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is
a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.10. Repayment of Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.

          (a) Subject to the other paragraphs of this Section, the Borrower
shall repay Term Borrowings on each date set forth below in the aggregate
principal amount set forth below opposite such date or, if such date is not a
Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day (each such date being
referred to as a "Term Loan Installment Date"):

          (c)  Prepayment of the Borrowings from:

          (i) all Net Proceeds and Excess Cash Flow pursuant to Section 2.11(b)
     or 2.11(c) shall be applied to the Term Borrowings, with the application
     thereof in direct chronological order to the unpaid amounts due on the next
     succeeding Term Loan Installment Dates, and

          (ii) any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to Section
     2.11(a) shall be applied to the remaining installments thereof as directed
     by the Borrower.

          (d) Prior to any repayment of any Borrowing under either Facility
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings under the
applicable Facility to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 2:00 p.m.,
Local Time, (i) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, one Business Day before the
scheduled date of such repayment and (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency
Borrowing, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment. Each
repayment of a Borrowing (x) in the case of the Revolving Facility, shall be
applied to the Revolving Facility Loans included in the repaid Borrowing such
that each Revolving Facility Lender receives its ratable share of such repayment
(based upon the Revolving Facility Credit Exposures of the Revolving Facility
Lenders at the time of such repayment) and (y) in all other cases, shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing; provided that for
prepayments made pursuant to Sections 2.11(b) or 2.11(c), each Term Loan Lender
may elect, by written notice to the Administrative Agent at least one Business
Day prior to the prepayment date, to decline its pro rata share of such Term
Loan repayment; in which case the amount so declined shall be offered ratably to
each non-rejecting Term Loan Lender, who shall have the right to reject such
additional amount, and any amounts so rejected shall be retained by the
Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding
sentence, prior to any repayment of a Swingline Borrowing hereunder, the
Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid and shall notify
the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection
not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the scheduled date of such repayment.
Repayments of Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount
repaid.

          SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans.

          (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without premium or penalty
(but subject to Section 2.16), in an aggregate principal amount that is an
integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing
Minimum or, if less, the aggregate amount then outstanding under the Term
Facility (in the case of a prepayment of a Term Borrowing) or the Revolving
Facility (in the case of a prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing), subject to
prior notice in accordance with Section 2.10(d).

          (b) The Borrower shall apply all Net Proceeds promptly upon receipt
thereof to prepay Term Borrowings in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Section 2.10.

          (c) Not later than 90 days after the end of each Excess Cash Flow
Period, the Borrower shall calculate Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow
Period and shall apply an amount equal to (x) the Required Percentage of such
Excess Cash Flow minus (y) the amount of any voluntary prepayments of Term Loans
during such Excess Cash Flow Period and the amount of any permanent voluntary
reductions during such Excess Cash Flow Period of Revolving Facility Commitments
to the extent that an equal amount of Revolving Facility Loans was
simultaneously repaid, other than, in each case, to the extent financed, or
intended to be financed, using the proceeds of the incurrence of Indebtedness
and so long as the amount of such prepayment is not already reflected in Debt
Service for such Excess Cash Flow Period to prepay Term Borrowings in accordance
with paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 2.10. Not


                                      -46-

<PAGE>

later than the date on which the Borrower is required to deliver financial
statements with respect to the end of each Excess Cash Flow Period under Section
5.04(a), the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate
signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth the amount, if any,
of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year and the calculation thereof in
reasonable detail.

          SECTION 2.12. Fees.

          (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender (other than any
Defaulting Lender), through the Administrative Agent, 10 Business Days after the
last Business Day of March, June, September and December in each year, and three
Business Days after the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all
the Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a commitment fee (a
"Commitment Fee") on the daily amount of the Available Unused Commitment of such
Lender during the preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the Closing
Date or ending with the date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender
shall be terminated) at the Commitment Fee Rate. All Commitment Fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360
days. For the purpose of calculating any Lender's Commitment Fee, the
outstanding Swingline Loans during the period for which such Lender's Commitment
Fee is calculated shall reduce the amount of the Available Unused Commitment on
a dollar for dollar basis. The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence
to accrue on the Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the date on which the
last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be terminated as provided herein.

          (b) The Borrower from time to time agrees to pay (i) to each Revolving
Facility Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the Administrative
Agent, 10 Business Days after the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year and three Business Days after the date on which the
Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as
provided herein, a fee (an "L/C Participation Fee") on such Lender's Revolving
Facility Percentage of the daily aggregate Revolving L/C Exposure (excluding the
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed L/C Disbursements), during the
preceding quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending
with the Revolving Facility Maturity Date or the date on which the Revolving
Facility Commitments shall be terminated) at the rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings effective for each day
in such period and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, (x) 10
Business Days after the last day of March, June, September and December of each
year and three Business Days after the date on which the Revolving Facility
Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a
fronting fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for
the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to
and including the termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate equal
to 1/4 of 1% per annum of the daily average stated amount of such Letter of
Credit), plus (y) in connection with the issuance, amendment or transfer of any
such Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement thereunder, such Issuing Bank's
customary documentary and processing charges (collectively, "Issuing Bank
Fees"). All L/C Participation Fees and Issuing Bank Fees that are payable on a
per annum basis shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days.

          (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the Administrative Agent, the agency fees set forth in the Fee
Letter, as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time, at the times specified therein (the "Administrative Agent Fees").

          (d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate,
among the Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid directly to the
applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under
any circumstances.

<PAGE>

          SECTION 2.13. Interest.

          (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline
Loan) shall bear interest at the ABR plus the Applicable Margin.

          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section; provided
that this paragraph (c) shall not apply to any Event of Default that has been
waived by the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.08.

          (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Revolving Facility
Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Facility Commitments and (iii) in the
case of the Term Loans, on the Term Facility Maturity Date; provided that (i)
interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on
demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than
a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

          (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the ABR at times when
the ABR is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day). The applicable ABR, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by
the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

          SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
     exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
     applicable, for such Interest Period; or

          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
     the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest
     Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
     making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such
     Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give written notice thereof to the Borrower
and the Lenders as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such
currency shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto an ABR
Borrowing, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing,
such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs.

          (a) If any Change in Law shall:

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or Issuing Bank; or

          (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank
     market any other condition (other than Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
     that are covered by Section 2.17 and Excluded Taxes) affecting this
     Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit
     or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing
Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower
will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by,
such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level
below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such
Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the
policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing
Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as
applicable, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

          (d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has determined that
it will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15,
such Lender or Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower thereof. Failure or delay
on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to
this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's
right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be
required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for
any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date
that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, notifies the Borrower of the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such
Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention


                                      -49-

<PAGE>

to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other
than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the
Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost
or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue a
Eurocurrency Loan, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in dollars
of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar market. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.17. Taxes.

          (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any
Loan Party hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if a Loan Party shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, as
applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c) Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 20 days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes payable by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Loan
Party hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted
on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, except for any expenses that
arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability, prepared in good
faith and delivered to such Loan Party by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by


                                      -50-

<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent on its own behalf, on behalf of another Agent or on
behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is
located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under this Agreement, shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), to the extent such Lender is legally entitled to do so,
at the time or times prescribed by applicable law and as reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be
made without such withholding tax or at a reduced rate; provided that no Lender
shall have any obligation under this paragraph (e) with respect to any
withholding Tax imposed by any jurisdiction other than the United States if in
the reasonable judgment of such Lender such compliance would subject such Lender
to any unreimbursed cost or expense or would otherwise be disadvantageous to
such Lender in any material respect.

          (f) Each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on the date on or before which such Foreign Lender becomes
a Lender under this Agreement (and promptly from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two copies
of whichever of the following is applicable: (i) duly completed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof or
successors thereto), claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty
to which the United States of America is a party, (ii) duly completed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any subsequent versions thereof or
successors thereto), (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits
of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the
Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a
"bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent
shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) or
881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
thereto), (iv) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY
together with the additional documentation that must be transmitted with Form
W-8IMY, including the appropriate forms described in (i), (ii) and (iii), or (v)
any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption
from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly completed
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction
required to be made. In addition, each Lender that is not a Foreign Lender other
than a Lender that may reasonably be treated as an exempt recipient based on the
indicators described in Treasury Regulation 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), shall deliver to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
thereto) on or before the date such Lender becomes a Lender under this
Agreement. In addition, in each of the foregoing circumstances, each Lender
shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence, expiration, or
invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender. Each Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously
delivered form or certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of
certification adopted by the United States of America or other taxing
authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this
paragraph that such Lender is not legally able to deliver.


                                      -51-

<PAGE>

          (g) If the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or a Lender determines,
in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with
respect to which such Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan
Party under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the
Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or such Lender (including any Taxes imposed
with respect to such refund) as is determined by the Administrative Agent,
Issuing Bank or Lender in good faith and in its sole discretion, and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided that such Loan Party, upon the written
request of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or such Lender, agrees to
repay as soon as reasonably practicable the amount paid over to such Loan Party
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or such Lender
in the event the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or such Lender is required
to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.17(g) shall
not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or any Lender
to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its
Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other person.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event will any Lender be
required to pay any amount to any Loan Party pursuant to this Section 2.17(g)
the payment of which would place such Lender in a less favorable net after-tax
position than such Lender would have been in if the additional amounts giving
rise to such refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes had never been paid.

          SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs.

          (a) Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment
required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16, or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without condition or deduction for any
defense, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such
time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed
to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the
Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to the applicable
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except
that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 shall be made
directly to the persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall
distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person
to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Any payment
required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to
have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or
before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in
accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or
settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.

          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully all amounts of
principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due from the
Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and
unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due from the Borrower hereunder,


                                      -52-

<PAGE>

ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to such parties.

          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans or participations in
L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment
of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans, Revolving
Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans and
accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then
the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face
value) participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and
participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the
extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and
participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or
participations in L/C Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than
to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Borrower (as to which
the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable
law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or
the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due. In such event, if
the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

          SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

          (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different


                                      -53-

<PAGE>

Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in L/C
Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction
in such compensation or payments. Nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be deemed
to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender that is a
Defaulting Lender.

          (c) If any Lender (such Lender, a "Non-Consenting Lender") has failed
to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which
pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the Lenders
affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their
consent, then the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting
Lender grants such consent) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring
such Non-Consenting Lender to promptly assign its Loans and its Commitments
hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent that shall consent to such proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or
termination, provided that: (a) all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such
Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such
Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, (b) the replacement
Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a
price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and (c) the replacement Lender shall pay the processing and recordation
fee referred to in Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B). In connection with any such
assignment the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and
the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04.

          SECTION 2.20. Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any
change in law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has
asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loans, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent,
any obligations of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Loans or to
convert ABR Borrowings to Eurocurrency Borrowings shall be suspended until such
Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower shall upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), either convert all Eurocurrency Borrowings of such Lender
to ABR Borrowings, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if
such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Borrowings to
such day, or


                                      -54-

<PAGE>

immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans.
Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

          SECTION 2.21. Incremental Extensions of Credit. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may at any time and from time to
time, request to add additional term loans (the "Incremental Term Loans") or
additional revolving credit commitments (the "Incremental Revolving
Commitments," and together with the Incremental Term Loans, the "Incremental
Extensions of Credit") in a minimum principal amount of $15.0 million for all
Incremental Term Loans or all Incremental Revolving Loans consummated on the
same date; provided that (x) immediately prior to and after giving effect to any
Incremental Facility Amendment, no Default has occurred or is continuing or
shall result therefrom and the Borrower shall, after giving effect to the
incurrence of the Incremental Term Loans, be in compliance with Sections 6.11
and 6.12 on a Pro Forma Basis as of the most recent Test Period and as of the
date of incurrence of the Incremental Term Loans and (y) the Incremental
Extensions of Credit shall rank pari passu in right of payment and right of
security in respect of the Collateral with the then existing Facilities. In
addition, (a) the Incremental Extensions of Credit shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not exceeding $100 million, (b) the Incremental Term Loans
shall not have a final maturity date earlier than the Term Loan Maturity Date,
(c) the Incremental Revolving Commitments shall not have a final maturity date
earlier than the Revolving Facility Maturity Date, (d) the Incremental Term
Loans shall not have a weighted average life that is shorter than that of the
then-remaining weighted average life of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date,
(e) the Incremental Revolving Commitments shall not have a weighted average life
that is shorter than that of the then-remaining weighted average life of the
Revolving Facility Commitments made on the Closing Date, (f) to the extent that
the terms of any Incremental Term Loans (other than as specifically contemplated
by immediately preceding clauses (b) and (d)) differ from the Term Loans made on
the Closing Date, such terms shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers, (g) to the extent that the
terms of any Incremental Revolving Commitments (other than as specifically
contemplated by immediately preceding clauses (c) and (e)) differ from the
Revolving Facility Commitments made on the Closing Date, such terms shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the
Joint Lead Arrangers, (h) the Applicable Margins for the Incremental Term Loans
shall be determined by Borrower and the applicable new Lenders; provided,
however, that the Applicable Margins for the Incremental Term Loans shall not be
greater than the then Applicable Margin payable with respect to Term Loans plus
50 basis points (and the Applicable Margin then applicable to the Term Loans
shall be increased to the extent necessary to achieve the foregoing) and (i) all
fees and expenses owing in respect of such Incremental Extensions of Credit to
the Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) shall have been paid. Any additional
bank, financial institution, existing Lender or other Person that elects to
extend commitments to provide Incremental Extensions of Credit shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and, in the case of Incremental
Revolving Commitments, the Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers
(any such bank, financial institution, existing Lender or other Person being
called an "Additional Lender") and shall become a Lender under this Agreement,
pursuant to an amendment (an "Incremental Facility Amendment") to this
Agreement, giving effect to the modifications permitted by this Section 2.21,
and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each
existing Lender agreeing to provide a commitment in respect of the Incremental
Extensions of Credit, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the
Administrative Agent. Commitments in respect of Incremental Extensions of Credit
shall become Commitments under this Agreement. An Incremental Facility Amendment
may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the
provisions of this Section. The effectiveness of any Incremental Facility
Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof (each, an
"Incremental Facility Closing Date") of each of the conditions set forth in
Section 4.01 (it being understood that all references to "the date of such
Borrowing" in Section 4.01 shall be deemed to refer to the Incremental


                                      -55-

<PAGE>

Facility Closing Date). Except as set forth above, the proceeds of the
Incremental Extensions of Credit shall be used for general corporate purposes
including Permitted Business Acquisitions.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          The Borrower represents and warrants to each of the Lenders that (it
being understood and agreed that the representations and warranties made on the

3.01, the Borrower and each of the Subsidiaries (a) is a limited partnership,

validity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or the rights and
remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereunder and (d) has the
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each
of the Loan Documents and each other agreement or instrument contemplated
thereby to which it is or will be a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to

          SECTION 3.02. Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Borrower and each Subsidiary Loan Party of each of the Loan Documents to

part of the Transactions (a) have been duly authorized by all corporate,
stockholder, limited partnership or limited liability company action required to
be obtained by the Borrower and such Subsidiary Loan Parties and (b) will not
(i) violate (A) any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, or of the

          SECTION 3.03. Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document when
executed and delivered by


                                      -56-

each Loan Party that is party thereto will constitute, a legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Loan Party enforceable against each such Loan Party
in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy,

laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) and (iii) implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.

together with its consolidated subsidiaries (including the notes thereto) (the
"Pro Forma Financial Statements") for the four-quarter period ending December
31, 2005, and pro forma EBITDA (the "Pro Forma EBITDA") for the four-quarter
period ending December 31, 2005, copies of which have heretofore been furnished
to each Lender via inclusion in the Information Memorandum, have been prepared
giving effect (as if such events had occurred at the beginning of such period)
to the Transactions. Each of the Pro Forma Financial Statements and the Pro
Forma EBITDA has been prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed by
the Borrower to have been reasonable as of the date of delivery thereof (it
being understood that such assumptions are based on good faith estimates of
certain items and that the actual amount of such items on the Closing Date is
subject to change) and, in the case of the Pro Forma Financial Statements, have

substantially similar to those set forth on Schedule 1.01(a) and other
adjustments reasonably acceptable to the Arrangers, and presents fairly in all
material respects on a pro forma basis the estimated financial position of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the Closing Date, assuming that
the Transactions had actually occurred at the first day of the relevant period.

          (b) The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower as at
September 30, 2004 and 2005, and the audited consolidated statements of income
and cash flows for such fiscal years, reported on by and accompanied by a report
from BDO Seidman, LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each
Lender, present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Borrower, as
at each such date and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of
the Borrower for the years then ended.

          (c) The audited consolidated balance sheets of Dictaphone as at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the audited consolidated statements of income
and cash flows for such fiscal years, reported on by and accompanied by a report
from Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished
to each Lender, present fairly the consolidated financial position of Dictaphone
as at each such date and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows
of Dictaphone for the years then ended.

statements of income and cash flows of (x) the Borrower and its subsidiaries and
(y) Dictaphone and its subsidiaries, for each fiscal quarter of the Borrower or
Dictaphone, as the case may be, ended at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date

each case, for the comparable quarter in the previous fiscal year), present
fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and Dictaphone, as
the case may be, (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
consistently throughout the periods involved (subject to (i) normal year-end
adjustments, (ii) adjustments, reclassifications and exceptions set forth in the
Acquisition Agreements and the schedules and exhibits thereto and (iii) the
absence of notes, except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants
and disclosed therein). Except as disclosed on Schedule 6.01 or as, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary has any material Guarantees,
contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or
unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign
currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of
derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements
referred to in this paragraph or in the Pro Forma Financial Statements. During
the period from September 30, 2005 to and including the Closing Date, there has
been no disposition by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries of any material
part of its business or property.

          SECTION 3.06. No Material Adverse Change or Material Adverse Effect.

assets, in each case, except for defects in title that do not interfere with its
ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties and assets for their intended purposes and except where the failure
to have such title could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All such properties and assets are
free and clear of Liens, other than Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

          (b) The Borrower and each Subsidiary has complied with all obligations
under all leases to which it is a party, except where the failure to comply
would not have Material Adverse Effect, and all such leases are in full force
and effect, except leases in respect of which the failure to be in full force
and effect could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.07(b),
the Borrower and each Subsidiary enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession
under all such leases, other than leases in respect of which the failure to
enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) As of the Closing Date, none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary has
received any notice of any pending or contemplated condemnation proceeding
affecting any of the Mortgaged Properties or any sale or disposition thereof in
lieu of condemnation that remains unresolved.

          (d) None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary is obligated on the Closing
Date under any right of first refusal, option or other contractual right to
sell, assign or otherwise dispose of any Mortgaged Property or any interest
therein, except as permitted under Section 6.02 or 6.05.

          (b) None of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective

their material properties and assets as currently conducted violate) any law,
rule or regulation (including any zoning, building, ordinance, code or approval
or any building permit, but excluding any Environmental Laws, which are subject
to Section 3.16) or any restriction of record or agreement affecting any
Mortgaged Property, or is in default with respect to any judgment, writ,

          (a) None of the Borrower and/or any Subsidiary is engaged principally,
or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, (i) to
purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness originally
incurred for such purpose, or (ii) for any purpose that entails a violation of,
or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of the Board,
including Regulation U or Regulation X.

          SECTION 3.11. Investment Company Act. None of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation
under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

appropriate proceedings in accordance with Section 5.03 and for which the
Borrower or such Subsidiary (as the case may be) has set aside on its books
adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP), which Taxes, if not paid, could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect; and

          (c) Other than as could not be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect as of the Closing
Date, with respect to the Borrower and each Subsidiary, there are no claims
being asserted in writing with respect to any Taxes.

          (d) None of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries has been a party to any
understanding or arrangement constituting a "tax shelter" within the meaning of
Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Code or within the meaning of Section 6111(c)

applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been
maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities, and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary have incurred any

administrative or other actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
Borrower's knowledge, threatened which allege a violation of or liability under
any Environmental Laws, in each case relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary,

give rise to any liability or obligation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under
any Environmental Laws, and no Hazardous Material has been generated, owned or

Borrower or any Subsidiary in a manner that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any liability or obligation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any
Environmental Laws, and (iv) there are no acquisition agreements in which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary has expressly assumed or undertaken responsibility
for any known or reasonably likely liability or obligation of any other Person
arising under or relating to Environmental Laws which, in any such case, has not

in the Collateral Agreement, when certificates or promissory notes, as
applicable, representing such Pledged Collateral are delivered to the
Administrative Agent, and in the case of the other Collateral described in the
Collateral Agreement (other than the Intellectual Property (as defined in the
Collateral Agreement)), when financing statements and other filings attached as
Schedule 6 to the Perfection Certificate are filed in the offices specified on
Schedule 7 of the Perfection Certificate, the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a fully perfected Lien on, and
security interest in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in such
Collateral and, subject to Section 9-315 of the New York Uniform Commercial
Code, the proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations to the extent
perfection can be obtained by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements, or possession, in each case prior and superior in right to any other
person (except, in the case of Collateral other than Pledged Collateral, Liens
expressly permitted by Section 6.02).

          (b) When the Collateral Agreement or an intellectual property security
agreement executed in accordance therewith is properly filed in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, as
applicable, and, with respect to Collateral in which a security interest cannot
be perfected by such filings, upon the proper filing of the financing statements
referred to in paragraph (a) above, the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of
the Secured Parties) shall have a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest
in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties thereunder in the
Intellectual Property, in each case prior and superior in right to any other
person (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, as
applicable, may be necessary to perfect a lien on registered trademarks and
patents, trademark and patent applications and registered copyrights acquired by
the grantors after the Closing Date).

create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on the Collateral described therein
and proceeds thereof. In the case of the Pledged Collateral described in a
Foreign Pledge Agreement, when certificates representing such Pledged Collateral
are delivered to the Administrative Agent and/or any other requirements
described in such Foreign Pledge Agreement have been complied with, the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a fully

5.10 shall be, effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of the Secured Parties) a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of
the Loan Parties' right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged Property
thereunder and the proceeds thereof, and when such Mortgages are filed or
recorded in the proper real estate filing or recording offices, the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) shall have a fully
perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of
the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged Property and, to the extent applicable,
subject to Section 9-315 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the proceeds thereof,
in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other than with
respect to the rights of a Person pursuant to Liens expressly permitted by
Section 6.02.

          SECTION 3.18. Location of Real Property and Leased Premises.

          (a) Schedule 8 to the Perfection Certificate lists completely and
correctly, as of the Closing Date, all material real property owned by the
Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties and the


                                      -62-

<PAGE>

addresses thereof. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan
Parties own in fee all the real property set forth as being owned by them on
such Schedules.

          (b) The Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan Parties have valid leases in
all material real property leased by the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan
Parties.

          SECTION 3.19. Solvency.

          (a) Immediately after giving effect to the Transactions on the Closing
Date, (i) the fair value of the assets of the Borrower (individually) and the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation, will
exceed the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise,
of the Borrower (individually) and the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis; (ii) the present fair saleable value of the property of the
Borrower (individually) and the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of the Borrower (individually) and the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis, respectively, on their debts and other liabilities,
direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other
liabilities become absolute and matured; (iii) the Borrower (individually) and
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay
their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (iv) the Borrower
(individually) and the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the businesses in
which they are engaged as such businesses are now conducted and are proposed to
be conducted following the Closing Date.

          (b) The Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe that it or
any of its subsidiaries will, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts
as they mature, taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be
received by it or any such subsidiary and the timing and amounts of cash to be
payable on or in respect of its Indebtedness or the Indebtedness of any such
subsidiary.

          SECTION 3.20. Labor Matters. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:
(a) there are no strikes or other labor disputes pending or threatened against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary; (b) the hours worked and payments made to
employees of the Borrower and each Subsidiary have not been in violation of the
Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable law dealing with such matters;
and (c) all payments due from the Borrower and each Subsidiary or for which any
claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages
and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits have been paid or
accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary to the
extent required by GAAP. Except (i) as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) as set
forth on Schedule 3.20, the consummation of the Transactions will not give rise
to a right of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union
under any material collective bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any
Subsidiary (or any predecessor of the Borrower or any Subsidiary) is a party or
by which the Borrower or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor of the Borrower or
any Subsidiary) is bound.

          SECTION 3.21. Insurance. Schedule 3.21 sets forth a true, complete and
correct description of all material insurance maintained by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date. As of such date, such
insurance is in full force and effect. The Borrower believes that the insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is adequate.

          SECTION 3.23. Acquisition Agreement; Representations and Warranties in
Acquisition Agreement. Schedule 3.23 lists (i) each exhibit, schedule, annex or
other attachment to the Acquisition Agreement and (ii) each agreement,
certificate, instrument, letter or other document contemplated by the
Acquisition Agreement or any item referred to in clause (i) to be entered into,
executed or delivered or to become effective in connection with the Acquisition
or otherwise entered into, executed or delivered in connection with the
Acquisition. The Lenders have been furnished true and correct copies of each
Acquisition Document to the extent executed and delivered on or prior to the
Closing Date. All representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in
the Acquisition Agreement were true and correct in all material respects as of
the time such representations and warranties were made and shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date as if such
representations and warranties were made on and as of such date, unless stated
to relate to a specific earlier date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier
date.

          SECTION 3.24. Intellectual Property.

          (a) Each Loan Party owns, or is licensed to use, all patents, patent
applications, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, technology,
trade secrets, proprietary information, domain names, know-how and processes
necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted (the
"Intellectual Property"), except for those the failure to own or license which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect and except that the Loan Parties may dispose of United
States Patents Nos. 6,480,304, 6,496,206, 6,009,442 and 6,262,732. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.24(a), to each Loan Party's knowledge, no claim has been
asserted and is pending by any person challenging the use of any such
Intellectual Property by such Loan Party or the validity or effectiveness of any
such Intellectual Property owned by such Loan Party, nor does any Loan Party
know of any valid basis for such claim. To each Loan Party's knowledge, the use
of such Intellectual Property by such Loan Party does not infringe the
intellectual property rights of any Person, except for such claims and
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Set forth on Schedule 3.24(b) are all issued patents, trademark
registrations, copyright registrations, and all applications for any of the
foregoing in the United States owned by the Loan Parties. Except pursuant to
licenses and other user agreements entered into by each Loan Party in the
ordinary course of business, on and as of the date hereof (i) to the knowledge
of each Loan Party, each Loan Party owns and possesses the right to use, and has
done nothing to authorize or enable any other person to use, any copyright,
patent or trademark (as such terms are defined in the Collateral Agreement)
listed on Schedule 3.24(b) and (ii) to the knowledge of the Loan Party, all
registrations listed on Schedule 3.24(b) are valid and in full force and effect.

          (c) To each Loan Party's knowledge, on and as of the date hereof,
there is no material infringement by others of any right of such Loan Party with
respect to any copyright, patent or trademark owned by any of the Loan Parties
and listed on Schedule 3.24(b), pledged by it under the name of such Loan Party
except as may be set forth on Schedule 3.25(c).

          SECTION 3.25. Agreements. No Loan Party is a party to any agreement or
instrument or subject to any corporate or other constitutional restriction that
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Loan Party is in default in any manner under any provision of any
indenture or other agreement or instrument evidencing Indebtedness, or any other
agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
property is or may be bound, where such default could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, and no condition exists which, with the
giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default.
Schedule 3.25 accurately and completely lists all material agreements to which
any Loan Party is


                                      -65-

a party which are in effect on the date hereof in connection with the operation
of the business conducted thereby and Borrower has delivered to the
Administrative Agent complete and correct copies of all such material
agreements, including any amendments, supplements or modifications with respect
thereto, and all such agreements are in full force and effect.

subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

          SECTION 4.01. All Credit Events. On the date of each Borrowing and on
the date of each issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of
Credit:

          (a) The Administrative Agent shall have received, in the case of a
     Borrowing, a Borrowing Request as required by Section 2.03 (or a Borrowing
     Request shall have been deemed given in accordance with the last paragraph
     of Section 2.03) or, in the case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the
     applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent shall have received a
     notice requesting the issuance of such Letter of Credit as required by
     Section 2.05(b).

          (b) The representations and warranties set forth in Article III (other
     than, if the date of such Borrowing or issuance, amendment, extension or
     renewal of a Letter of Credit is the Closing Date, in Section 3.06) shall
     be true and correct in all material respects as of such date (other than an
     amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit without any increase
     in the stated amount of such Letter of Credit), as applicable, with the
     same effect as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent
     such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in
     which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and
     correct in all material respects as of such earlier date); provided that
     any representation or warranty that is being made on the Closing Date (but
     not at any time thereafter) and relates to the consents and approvals
     needed to consummate the Acquisition or the historical business and
     operations of Dictaphone, satisfaction of such representation or warranty
     shall be governed by satisfaction of the representation or warranty
     relating to such matters in the Acquisition Agreement (without giving
     effect to any waiver, amendment or other modification to the Acquisition
     Agreement in a manner adverse to the Lenders in any respect effected
     without the consent of the Administrative Agent); provided further that the
     provisions of this Section 4.01(b) shall not apply to any representation or
     warranty that is being made on the Closing Date (but not any time
     thereafter) that relates to the historical business and operations of the
     Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Dictaphone and the Subsidiaries
     that were subsidiaries of Dictaphone prior to the Closing Date).

          (c) At the time of and immediately after such Borrowing or issuance,
     amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit (other than an
     amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit without any increase
     in the stated amount of such Letter of Credit), as applicable, no Event of
     Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing; provided that
     with respect to any Default or Event of Default resulting from the breach
     of any representation or warranty that is being made on the Closing Date
     (but not at any time thereafter) and relates to the consents and approvals
     needed to consummate the Acquisition or the historical business and
     operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, satisfaction of such
     representation or warranty shall be governed


                                      -66-

<PAGE>

     by satisfaction of the representation or warranty relating to such matters
     in the Acquisition Agreement.

          Each Borrowing and each issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of a
Letter of Credit shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by
the Borrower on the date of such Borrowing, issuance, amendment, extension or
renewal, as applicable, as to the matters specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of
this Section 4.01.

          SECTION 4.02. First Credit Event. On the Closing Date:

     Lenders and (C) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
     Administrative Agent and covering such other matters relating to the Loan
     Documents and the Transactions as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably
     request, and the Borrower hereby instructs its counsel to deliver such

keep in full force and effect its legal existence, except, in the case of a
Subsidiary, (i) where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to

remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereunder, (ii) as

          SECTION 5.02. Insurance.

          (a) Maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies, insurance in such amounts and against such risks as are customarily

any action that is reasonably likely to be the basis for termination, revocation
or denial of any insurance coverage required to be maintained under such Loan

claim under any insurance policy maintained in respect of the premises.

          SECTION 5.03. Taxes. Pay and discharge promptly when due all material
Taxes imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or in respect of its
property before the same shall become delinquent or in default, as well as all
lawful claims which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon such properties
or any part thereof; provided, however, that such payment and discharge shall
not be required with respect to any such Tax or claim so long as such Tax or
claim is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and the
Borrower or the affected Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall have set aside on
its books reserves in accordance with GAAP with respect thereto.

     the Borrower or any other Loan Party not to be, a valid and perfected
     security interest (perfected as or having the priority required by this
     Agreement or the relevant Security Document and subject to such limitations
     and restrictions as are set forth herein and therein) in such assets, (iii)
     the Guarantees pursuant to the Collateral Agreement by any Subsidiary Loan

hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein or in any
other Loan Document to the contrary not-withstanding.

          SECTION 7.02. Exclusion of Immaterial Subsidiaries. Solely for the
purposes of determining whether an Event of Default has occurred under clause
(h), (i) or (l) of Section 7.01, any reference in any such clause to any

or circumstance referred to in any such clause that did not, as of the last day
of the fiscal quarter of the Borrower most recently ended, have assets with a
value in excess of 5% of the Consolidated Total Assets or 5% of total revenues
of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of such date; provided that if it is
necessary to exclude more than one Subsidiary from clause (h), (i) or (l) of

consolidated Subsidiary for purposes of determining whether the condition
specified above is satisfied.

          SECTION 7.03. Borrower's Right to Cure.

          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
7.01, in the event that the Borrower fails to comply with the requirements of
any Financial Performance Covenant, until the expiration of the 10th day
subsequent to the date the certificate calculating such Financial Performance
Covenant is required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(c), the Borrower
shall have the right to issue Permitted Cure Securities for cash or otherwise
receive cash contributions (collectively, the "Cure Right"), and upon the
receipt by the Borrower of such cash (the "Cure Amount") pursuant to the
exercise of such Cure Right such Financial Performance Covenant shall be
recalculated giving effect to the following pro forma adjustments:

          (i) EBITDA shall be increased, solely for the purpose of measuring the
     Financial Performance Covenants and not for any other purpose under this
     Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount; and

          (ii) If, after giving effect to the foregoing recalculations, the
     Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of all Financial
     Performance Covenants, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the
     requirements of the Financial Performance Covenants as of the relevant date
     of determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure
     to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of
     the Financial Performance Covenants that had occurred shall be deemed cured
     for the purposes of this Agreement.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in each
four-fiscal-quarter period there shall be at least one fiscal quarter in which
the Cure Right is not exercised, (ii) in each eight-fiscal-quarter period, there
shall be at least four fiscal quarters during which the Cure Right is not
exercised and (iii) for purposes of this Section 7.03, the Cure Amount shall be

Performance Covenants.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   THE AGENTS

          SECTION 8.01. Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates
and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably
authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on
its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated
to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

          SECTION 8.02. Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may
execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by
or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

          SECTION 8.03. Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be
(i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such
person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and
nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from its or such person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii)
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure
of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.

          SECTION 8.04. Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document
or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified
by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
expense that may be


                                      -92-

<PAGE>

incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in
accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this
Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of
the Loans.

          SECTION 8.05. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all
Lenders); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have
received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Lenders.

          SECTION 8.06. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any
affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that
it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender,
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates.

          SECTION 8.07. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and
without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), each in an amount
equal to its pro rata share (based on its Commitments hereunder (or if such
Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the
respective principal amounts of its applicable outstanding Loans or
participations in L/C Disbursements, as applicable)) thereof, from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that
may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing;


                                      -93-

<PAGE>

provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

          SECTION 8.08. Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its
affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter
of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

          SECTION 8.09. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the
Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall
appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c),
(h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the
Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the
Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
agent as provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

          SECTION 8.10. Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent. Neither the
Syndication Agent nor the Documentation Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.

          SECTION 8.11. Quebec Security. The Administrative Agent hereby agrees
to act as the fonde de pouvoir (holder of the power of attorney) for the Secured
Parties to the extent necessary or desirable for the purposes of this Agreement,
the Collateral Agreement and any hypothec or other security that may be granted
from time to time by Speechworks International Inc. or any other Loan Party for
the benefit of the Secured Parties under the laws of the Province of Quebec. By
becoming a Secured Party, each Secured Party accepts and confirms the
appointment of the Administrative Agent as fonde de pouvoir (holder of the power
of attorney) of such Secured Party. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32
of the Act respecting the Special Powers of Legal Persons (Quebec), the
Administrative Agent may acquire and be the holder of any debenture, bond or
other title of indebtedness that may be issued from time to time by Speechworks
International Inc. or any other Loan Party.

representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties herein, in the other
Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan

Issuing Bank and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans, the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the issuance of the Letters of
Credit, regardless of any investigation made by such persons or on their behalf,
and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or L/C Disbursement or any Fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and
unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments


                                      -95-

<PAGE>
have not been terminated. Without prejudice to the survival of any other

contained herein (including pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.17 and 9.05) shall
survive the payment in full of the principal and interest hereunder, the
expiration of the Letters of Credit and the termination of the Commitments or
this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.03. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received copies hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each
Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

          SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns.

          (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower
without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with
this Section 9.04. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of
the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent
provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 9.04), and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank
and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

          (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (each, an "Assignee") all
or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of:

          (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
     required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an
     Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default under Section
     7.01(b), (c), (h), or (i) has occurred and is continuing, any other person;

          (B) the Administrative Agent; and

          (C) the Issuing Bank; provided that no consent of the Issuing Bank
     shall be required for an assignment of all or any portion of a Term Loan.

               (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
          conditions:

          (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a
     Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount
     of the assigning Lender's Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the
     amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each
     such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance
     with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent)
     shall not be less than (x) $1.0 million in the case of Term Loans and (y)
     $2.5 million in the case of Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility
     Commitments, unless each of the Borrower and the


                                      -96-

<PAGE>

     Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that such amounts shall be
     aggregated in respect of each Lender and its Affiliates or Approved Funds,
     if any;

          (B) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

          (C) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

For the purposes of this Section 9.04, "Approved Fund" means any person (other
than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or
investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course
and that is administered, advised or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate
of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers,
advises or manages a Lender.

          (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(v) below, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section 9.04.

          (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, the stated interest on and
principal amount of the Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment, whether or not evidenced by a promissory note, shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph (b)(v).

          (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the
Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain


                                      -97-

<PAGE>

unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a
Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents; provided that (x) such agreement may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby pursuant to Section 9.04(a)(i) or clause (i), (ii),
(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of the first proviso to Section 9.08(b) and (2)
directly affects such Participant and (y) no other agreement with respect to
such Participant may exist between such Lender and such Participant. Subject to
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c)(i) and to paragraph (c)(ii) of
this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements of
those Sections as if it were a Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section 9.04. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c)(i), to
the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
shall be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

               (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Borrower's prior written consent.

          (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of or notice to
the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge
or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment
of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.

          (e) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant
Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate
transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.

          (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any
or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender
without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. Each of the
Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will
not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other person in instituting
against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency
or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one
year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial
paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender
designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless each other party hereto and each Loan Party for any loss, cost, damage
or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against
such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.

          (g) If the Borrower wishes to replace the Loans or Commitments under
any Facility with ones having different terms, it shall have the option, with
the consent of the Administrative Agent and subject to at least three Business
Days' advance notice to the Lenders under such Facility, instead of


                                      -98-

<PAGE>

prepaying the Loans or reducing or terminating the Commitments to be replaced,
to (i) require the Lenders under such Facility to assign such Loans or
Commitments to the Administrative Agent or its designees and (ii) amend the
terms thereof in accordance with Section 9.08 (with such replacement, if
applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 9.08(d)).
Pursuant to any such assignment, all Loans and Commitments to be replaced shall
be purchased at par (allocated among the Lenders under such Facility in the same
manner as would be required if such Loans were being optionally prepaid or such
Commitments were being optionally reduced or terminated by the Borrower),
accompanied by payment of any accrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts
owing pursuant to Section 9.05(b). By receiving such purchase price, the Lenders
under such Facility shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or
Commitments under such Facility pursuant to the terms of the form of Assignment
and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit A, and accordingly no other action by
such Lenders shall be required in connection therewith. The provisions of this
paragraph (g) are intended to facilitate the maintenance of the perfection and
priority of existing security interests in the Collateral during any such
replacement.

          SECTION 9.05. Expenses; Indemnity.

          (a) The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including Other Taxes) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with
the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and by the
Administrative Agent or Joint Lead Arrangers in connection with the syndication
of the Commitments or Loans or the administration of this Agreement (including
(i) expenses incurred in connection with due diligence and initial and ongoing
Collateral examination (after the Closing Date, to the extent no Event of
Default shall have occurred or be continuing, expenses referred to in this
clause (i) shall be subject to the Borrower's reimbursement only with the
Borrower's prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)), (ii)
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP,
counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers and (iii) the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one local counsel per jurisdiction
where Collateral is located or a Subsidiary Loan Party is incorporated) or in
connection with the administration of this Agreement and any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the
Transactions hereby contemplated shall be consummated) or incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or
protection of their rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the Loans made hereunder or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder.

          (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Joint Lead Arrangers, each Issuing Bank, each Lender and each of their
respective directors, trustees, officers, employees, advisors and agents (each
such person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related
expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred
by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with,
or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the
performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of any
Letter of Credit or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party
thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Subject to and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the Borrower agrees to
indemnify each Indemnitee against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities


                                      -99-

<PAGE>

and related expenses, including reasonable counsel or consultant fees, charges
and disbursements (limited to not more than one counsel, plus, if necessary, one
local counsel per jurisdiction), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee
arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (A) any claim
related in any way to Environmental Laws and the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or
(B) any actual or alleged presence, Release or threatened Release of Hazardous
Materials at, under, on or from any Property; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related
Parties. The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
referred to in this Section 9.05 effected without their written consent, but if
settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the
plaintiff, the Borrower shall indemnify the Indemnitees from and against any
loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment, subject to the
Borrower's right in this Section 9.05 to claim an exemption from such indemnity
obligations. The Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of any
Indemnitee, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which such Indemnitee is or could have been a party and indemnity
could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee unless such settlement (i)
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or
claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include
a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by
or on behalf of any Indemnitee. None of the Indemnitees (or any of their
respective affiliates) shall be responsible or liable to the Sponsor, the
Borrower or any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders or
any other person or entity for any consequential or punitive damages, which may
be alleged as a result of the Facilities or the Transactions. The provisions of
this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this
Section 9.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor accompanied by
reasonable documentation with respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or
other amount requested.

          (c) Except as expressly provided in Section 9.05(a) with respect to
Other Taxes, which shall not be duplicative with any amounts paid pursuant to
Section 2.17, this Section 9.05 shall not apply to Taxes.

          SECTION 9.06. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower or any Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations
of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document held by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender or such Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such other Loan Document and although the obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender and each Issuing Bank under this Section
9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
set-off) that such Lender or such Issuing Bank may have.

          SECTION 9.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN LETTERS OF CREDIT AND AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

          SECTION 9.08. Waivers; Amendment.

          (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank
or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any Loan
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of
the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower
or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any case
shall entitle such person to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.

          (b) Except as provided in Section 2.21 with respect to an Incremental
Facility Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders and (y) in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by each party thereto and the Administrative Agent and consented to by the
Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall

          (i) decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final
     maturity of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C
     Disbursement, or extend the stated expiration of any Letter of Credit
     beyond the Revolving Facility Maturity Date, without the prior written
     consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided that any
     amendment to the financial covenant definitions in this Agreement shall not
     constitute a reduction in the rate of interest for purposes of this clause
     (i),

          (ii) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender or decrease the
     Commitment Fees or L/C Participation Fees or other fees of any Lender
     without the prior written consent of such Lender (it being understood that
     waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or
     Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the aggregate Commitments
     shall not constitute an increase of the Commitment of any Lender),

          (iii) extend or waive any Term Loan Installment Date or reduce the
     amount due on any Term Loan Installment Date or extend any date on which
     payment of interest on any Loan or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees is due,
     without the prior written consent of each Lender adversely affected
     thereby,

          (iv) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.18(b) or (c) or
     2.10(d) of this Agreement or Section 5.02 of the Collateral Agreement in a
     manner that would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments
     required thereby, without the prior written consent of each Lender
     adversely affected thereby,

          (v) amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the
     definition of the terms "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof
     specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
     modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
     hereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender adversely
     affected thereby (it being understood that, with the consent of the
     Required Lenders, additional extensions


                                     -101-

<PAGE>

     of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination
     of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Loans and
     Commitments are included on the Closing Date),

          (vi) release all or substantially all the Collateral or release all or
     substantially all of the Subsidiary Loan Parties from their respective
     Guarantees under the Collateral Agreement, unless, in the case of a
     Subsidiary Loan Party, all or substantially all the Equity Interests of
     such Subsidiary Loan Party is sold or otherwise disposed of in a
     transaction permitted by this Agreement, without the prior written consent
     of each Lender, or

          (vii) effect any waiver, amendment or modification of any Loan
     Document that would alter the relative priorities of the rights of the
     Secured Parties in the Collateral;

provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such
Issuing Bank acting as such at the effective date of such agreement, as
applicable. Each Lender shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification
authorized by this Section 9.08 and any consent by any Lender pursuant to this
Section 9.08 shall bind any assignee of such Lender.

          (c) Without the consent of the Syndication Agent, the Documentation
Agent or any Joint Lead Arranger or Lender or Issuing Bank, the Loan Parties and
the Administrative Agent may (in their respective sole discretion, or shall, to
the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any amendment, modification
or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter into any new agreement or instrument,
to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any
security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral
for the benefit of the Secured Parties, or as required by local law to give
effect to, or protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein comply with
applicable law.

          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to add one or more additional credit
facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to
time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof
to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with the Term Loans and the Revolving Facility Loans and the accrued interest
and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the Lenders holding
such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.

          SECTION 9.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate, together
with all fees and charges that are treated as interest under applicable law
(collectively, the "Charges"), as provided for herein or in any other document
executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for, charged, received,
taken or reserved by any Lender or any Issuing Bank, shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate
of interest payable hereunder, together with all Charges payable to such Lender
or such Issuing Bank, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate; provided that such
excess amount shall be paid to such Lender or such Issuing Bank on subsequent
payment dates to the extent not exceeding the legal limitation.

          SECTION 9.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and the agreements regarding certain Fees referred to herein
constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to the subject
matter hereof. Any previous agreement among or representations from the parties
or their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Fee Letter shall survive the execution and delivery


                                     -102-

<PAGE>

of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement
or in the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon
any party other than the parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents.

          SECTION 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.11.

          SECTION 9.12. Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

          SECTION 9.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which,
when taken together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 9.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart to
this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually signed original.

          SECTION 9.14. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.15. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

          (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any
New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New
York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that any Lender or any Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring
any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
against the Borrower or any Loan Party or their properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.


                                     -103-

<PAGE>

          (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

          SECTION 9.16. Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders, each Issuing Bank
and each of the Agents agrees that it shall maintain in confidence any
information relating to the Borrower and the other Loan Parties furnished to it
by or on behalf of the Borrower or the other Loan Parties (other than
information that (a) has become generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by such party, (b) has been independently developed by
such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Agent without violating this Section 9.16
or (c) was available to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Agent from a
third party having, to such person's knowledge, no obligations of
confidentiality to the Borrower or any other Loan Party) and shall not reveal
the same other than to its directors, trustees, officers, employees, advisors
and Affiliates with a need to know or to any person that approves or administers
the Loans on behalf of such Lender (so long as each such person shall have been
instructed to keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16),
except: (A) to the extent necessary to comply with law or any legal process or
the requirements of any Governmental Authority, the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners or of any securities exchange on which securities of the
disclosing party or any Affiliate of the disclosing party are listed or traded,
(B) as part of the reporting or review procedures to, or examinations by,
Governmental Authorities or self-regulatory authorities, including the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners or the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., (C) to its parent companies, Affiliates or auditors (so long as
each such person shall have been instructed to keep the same confidential in
accordance with this Section 9.16), (D) in order to enforce its rights under any
Loan Document in a legal proceeding, (E) to any pledge under Section 9.04(d) or
any other prospective assignee of, or prospective Participant in, any of its
rights under this Agreement (so long as such person shall have been instructed
to keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16) and (F) to
any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in Swap Agreements or such
contractual counterparty's professional advisor (so long as such contractual
counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to
be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.16).

          SECTION 9.17. Direct Website Communications.

          (a) Delivery. (i) Each Loan Party hereby agrees that it will provide
to the Administrative Agent all information, documents and other materials that
it is obligated to furnish to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, all
notices, requests, financial statements, financial and other reports,
certificates and other information materials, but excluding any such
communication that (A) relates to a request for a new, or a conversion of an
existing, borrowing or other extension of credit (including any election of an
interest rate or interest period relating thereto), (B) relates to the payment
of any principal or other amount due under this Agreement prior to the scheduled
date therefor, (C) provides notice of any Default or Event of Default under this
Agreement or (D) is required to be delivered to satisfy any condition precedent
to the effectiveness of this Agreement and/or any borrowing or other extension
of credit hereunder (all such non-excluded communications collectively, the
"Communications"), by transmitting the Communications in an electronic/soft
medium in a format acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Information required
to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement (to the extent not made available as
set forth above) shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Administrative
Agent on the date on which the Borrower provides written notice to the
Administrative Agent that such information has been posted on the Borrower's
website on the Internet at www.nuance.com (to the extent such information has
been posted or is available as described


                                     -104-

<PAGE>
in such notice). In addition, each Loan Party agrees to continue to provide the
Communications to the Administrative Agent in the manner specified in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document but only to the extent requested by the
Administrative Agent. Nothing in this Section 9.17 shall prejudice the right of
the Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers or any Lender or any Loan Party to give any
notice or other communication pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any other manner specified in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

               (ii) The Administrative Agent agrees that receipt of the
Communications by the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address set forth above
shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative
Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that notice to it
(as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been
posted to the Platform (as defined below) shall constitute effective delivery of
the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each
Lender agrees (A) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by
electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender's e-mail address to
which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (B) that
the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

          (b) Posting. Each Loan Party further agrees that the Administrative
Agent may make the Communications available to the Lenders by posting the
Communications on Intralinks or a substantially similar electronic transmission
system (the "Platform").

          (c) Platform. The Platform is provided "as is" and "as available." The
Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of
the Communications, or the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim
liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any
kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third
party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent
Party in connection with the Communications or the Platform. In no event shall
the Administrative Agent or any of its affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or representatives
(collectively, "Agent Parties") have any liability to the Loan Parties, any
Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without
limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages,
losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any
Loan Party's or the Administrative Agent's transmission of communications
through the internet, except to the extent the liability of any Agent Party is
found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have resulted primarily from such Agent Party's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

          SECTION 9.18. Release of Liens and Guarantees. In the event that any
Loan Party conveys, sells, leases, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of
all or any portion of any of the Equity Interests or assets of any Subsidiary
Loan Party to a person that is not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party
in a transaction not prohibited by Section 6.05, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to) take
such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower and at the Borrower's expense to release any Liens created by any Loan
Document in respect of such Equity Interests, and, in the case of a disposition
of the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary Loan Party in a transaction permitted
by Section 6.05 and as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party would cease
to be a Subsidiary, terminate such Subsidiary Loan Party's obligations under its
Guarantee. In addition, the Administrative Agent agrees to take such actions as
are reasonably requested by the Borrower and at the Borrower's expense to
terminate the Liens and security interests created by the Loan Documents when
all the Obligations are paid in full and all Letters of Credit and Commitments
are terminated. Any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Loan
Document relating to any such Equity Interests, asset or subsidiary of the
Borrower shall no


                                     -105-
<PAGE>

longer be deemed to be made once such Equity Interests or asset is so conveyed,
sold, leased, assigned, transferred or disposed of.

          SECTION 9.19. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the
Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.

          SECTION 9.20. Dollar Equivalent Calculations. For purposes of this
Agreement, the Dollar Equivalent of the stated amount of each Letter of Credit
that is an Alternate Currency Letter of Credit shall be calculated on the date
when any such Letter of Credit is issued, on the first Business Day of each
month and at such other times as designated by the Administrative Agent. Such
Dollar Equivalent shall remain in effect until the same is recalculated by the
Administrative Agent as provided above and notice of such recalculation is
received by Borrower, it being understood that until such notice of such
recalculation is received, the Dollar Equivalent shall be that Dollar Equivalent
as last reported to Borrower by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of each such determination
of the Dollar Equivalent.

          SECTION 9.21. Judgment Currency

          (a) Borrower's obligation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
to make payments in the applicable Approved Currency (pursuant to such
obligation, the "Obligation Currency") shall not be discharged or satisfied by
any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in or converted into
any currency other than the Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such
tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the Administrative Agent
or the respective Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed
to be payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment
against Borrower in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to
convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other
currency being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency") an amount due
in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made at the Relevant
Currency Equivalent, and in the case of other currencies, the rate of exchange
(as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent does not
quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such currency
designated by the Administrative Agent) determined, in each case, as of the
Business Day immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such
Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the "Judgment Currency Conversion
Date").

          (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between
the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the
amount due, Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, such
additional amounts, if any (but in any event not a lesser amount) as may be
necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will
produce the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased
with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial
award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.

          (c) For purposes of determining the Relevant Currency Equivalent or
any other rate of exchange for this Section 9.21, such amounts shall include any
premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation
Currency.
